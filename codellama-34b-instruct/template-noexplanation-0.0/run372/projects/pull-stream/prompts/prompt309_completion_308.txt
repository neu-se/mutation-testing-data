  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This change will cause the `take` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input data. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which will cause it to return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && false
```
This change will cause the `take` function to always return `false`, regardless of the input data. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which will cause it to return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || false
```
This change will cause the `take` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input data. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which will cause it to return an error.

DONE.
