 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by a constant value would change the result of the complex number's imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of a different mathematical constant would change the result of the complex number's imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of a random value would introduce unpredictability in the result of the complex number's imaginary part.

DONE.
