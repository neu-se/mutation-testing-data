  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` function is not the same as the `deg2rad` function, which is used to convert degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosφ1` function is not the same as the `deg2rad` function, which is used to convert degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanφ1` function is not the same as the `deg2rad` function, which is used to convert degrees to radians.

DONE.
