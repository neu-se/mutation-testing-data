  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes an error as an argument, while `cb` is a function that takes a value as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a boolean value that indicates whether the operation was aborted, while `cb` is a function that takes a value as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value, while `cb` is a function that takes a value as an argument.

DONE.
