Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the arguments array from 1 to 0, which would include the callback function itself in the arguments passed to `nfapply`, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when invoking the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `2`, which would skip the first argument (the callback) and start from the second argument, leading to the wrong set of arguments being passed to the `nfapply` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the arguments object as the starting index, which could lead to an empty array being passed to `nfapply` if no additional arguments are provided, causing the callback to be invoked with no arguments.

DONE.
