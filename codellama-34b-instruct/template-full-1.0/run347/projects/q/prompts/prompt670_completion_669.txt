  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, and the first argument would be passed as an array, which is not the intended use case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument, which is not the intended use case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument, which is not the intended use case.

DONE.
