  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `progress` as the third argument for `Q.then`, but `progress` is not defined in the provided code snippet. By removing `progress`, the behavior of the code would change because the `progress` callback would no longer be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, "fake progress"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `progress` as a variable name, but "fake progress" is a string literal, which would cause a type error if used in the same context. By replacing `progress` with a string literal, the behavior of the code would change because a string would be passed as the third argument to `Q.then` instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, "rejected", progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `reject
