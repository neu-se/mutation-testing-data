  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && <PLACEHOLDER>(abort === true ? null: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with a `null` value instead of the `abort` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && <PLACEHOLDER>(abort === true ? undefined: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with an `undefined` value instead of the `abort` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && <PLACEHOLDER>(abort === true ? false: abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function would be called with a `false` value instead of the `abort` variable.

DONE.
