  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'zip'`, which would create a zip archive instead of a tar archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'tar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'tar'`, which would create a tar archive instead of a zip archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'gzip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'gzip'`, which would create a gzip archive instead of a tar or zip archive.

DONE.
