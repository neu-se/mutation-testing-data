  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` handler would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` handler would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(neoop);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `neoop` handler would be called for both fulfilled and rejected promises, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
