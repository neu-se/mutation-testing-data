  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with an error, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would not emit the `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `destroy` method to be called with a null error, which would not trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would emit the `error` event.
