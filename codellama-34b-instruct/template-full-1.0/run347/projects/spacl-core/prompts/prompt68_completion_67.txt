  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const x of this.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a new variable name that is not used in the original code, so it would not be subject to the same restrictions on usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in an array, so the loop would iterate over the elements in the opposite order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all the elements of `this.rules` except for the first one, so the loop would iterate over a different set of elements.

DONE.
