  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value returned by the `get` method, whereas the original code would return the value as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value returned by the `get` method by 2, whereas the original code would return the value as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]).then(function(value) {
    return value - 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value returned by the `get` method, whereas the original code would return the
