 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the length of the `ops` arrays, not their actual content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0] === other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the first element of the `ops` arrays, not their full content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(this.ops) === JSON.stringify(other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for deep equality of the `ops` arrays, but in a way that is sensitive to the order of elements and the specific representation of objects and arrays in the JSON format.

DONE.
