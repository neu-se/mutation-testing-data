  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be able to concatenate the stack traces of `promise` and `error`, which could lead to incorrect error reporting and debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = new Error().stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would be using a new `Error` object instead of `error`, which could produce different stack trace information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = error.stack + "\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n" + promise.stack;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would be concatenating the stack traces of `promise` and `error` differently, which could lead to incorrect error reporting and debugging.

DONE.
