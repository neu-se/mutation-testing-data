 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` value would be replaced with the `data` value, which could cause the callback to receive incorrect data or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` value would be replaced with `null`, which could cause the callback to receive incorrect data or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` value would be replaced with a function that always returns `true`, which could cause the callback to be called prematurely or inappropriately.

DONE.
