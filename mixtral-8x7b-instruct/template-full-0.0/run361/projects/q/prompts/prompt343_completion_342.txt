 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 + fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `then` call would be the sum of 1 and the fulfilled value, instead of just the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the fulfilled value is falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`, or an empty string), the resulting value would be `0` instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fulfilled.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because if the fulfilled value is not a string, attempting to call `toUpperCase()` on it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
