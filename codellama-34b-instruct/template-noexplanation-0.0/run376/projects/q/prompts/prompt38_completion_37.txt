  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter
```
This change will cause the domain to enter instead of exit, which may cause unintended behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This change will cause the domain to exit immediately, which may cause unintended behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(1)
```
This change will cause the domain to exit with a non-zero exit code, which may cause unintended behavior in the program.

DONE.
