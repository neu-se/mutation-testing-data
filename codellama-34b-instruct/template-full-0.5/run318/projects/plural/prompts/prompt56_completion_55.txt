  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'ves' to the input word, while this new code fragment appends 's' to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'ves' to the input word, while this new code fragment appends 'es' to the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'es' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends 'ves' to the input word, while this new code fragment appends 'es' and then 's' to the input word.

DONE.
