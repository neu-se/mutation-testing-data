  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
TypeError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the TypeError constructor returns a TypeError object, unlike the SyntaxError constructor which returns a SyntaxError object. The TypeError object would likely be interpreted as a runtime error rather than a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ReferenceError('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the ReferenceError constructor returns a ReferenceError object, which indicates that a variable or reference is not defined. This would likely be interpreted as a runtime error rather than a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the Error constructor returns an Error object, which indicates a more general runtime error. This would likely be interpreted as a more serious error than a SyntaxError or TypeError.

DONE.
