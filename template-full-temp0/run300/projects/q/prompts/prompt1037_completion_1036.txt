  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a resolved value of `undefined`, while this new code fragment creates a deferred object with a resolved value of `null`. This could potentially cause issues in the `put` method, where the `ends.resolve` function is called with a value of `null` instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue")));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object with a resolved value of `undefined`, while this new code fragment creates a deferred object with a rejected value of `Error("Can't get value from closed queue")`. This could potentially cause issues in the `get` method, where the `ends.promise.get("head")` function is called on a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.
