  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `process.stdout`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and the data to be written to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `process.stderr`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and the data to be written to the console, but with the difference that the data is written to the standard error stream instead of the standard output stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream`
