  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` takes an object and returns its string representation, whereas `JSON.parse` takes a string and returns its object representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` takes a string and executes it as JavaScript code, whereas `JSON.parse` takes a string and returns its object representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` takes an object and logs it to the console, whereas `JSON.parse` takes a string and returns its object representation.

DONE.
