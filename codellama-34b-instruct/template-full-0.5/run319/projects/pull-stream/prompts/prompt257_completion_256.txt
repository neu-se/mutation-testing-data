  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would not be executed, even if `err` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `err`. If `err` is null, `!err` would be true, and the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `err === null` is a boolean value that checks if `err` is null. If `err` is null, the `if` statement would be executed.

DONE.
