Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the parser to continue processing even when there are unbalanced plus and minus signs, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(c) && c !== '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the string '0' as a valid number, while any other NaN value would cause the parser to exit, which could lead to incorrect handling of valid numeric inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check for the length of the string `c`, which is not applicable since `c` is expected to be a single token, leading to a failure in parsing valid numeric tokens.

DONE.
