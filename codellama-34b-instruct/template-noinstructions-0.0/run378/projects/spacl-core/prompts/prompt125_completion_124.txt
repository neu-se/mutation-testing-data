  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the count is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if the count is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the count is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if the count is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the count is greater than 0, while the new code fragment checks if the count is greater than 1.

DONE.
