  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `\n` is a newline character, while `" "` is a space character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `\n` is a newline character, while `"\\n"` is a string containing a backslash and the letter "n".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\r\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `\n` is a newline character, while `"\\r\\n"` is a string containing a backslash, the letter "r", and another backslash, followed by the letter "n".

DONE.
