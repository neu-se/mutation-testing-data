  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while this replacement is a function call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while this replacement is a null value, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while this replacement is an undefined value, which would result in a different value being passed to the `nodeArgs.push()` method.

DONE.
