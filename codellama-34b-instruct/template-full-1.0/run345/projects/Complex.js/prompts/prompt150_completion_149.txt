  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is NaN (Not a Number), while `isInfinite` checks if the value is positive or negative infinity. In the case of the `pow` function, if the base is infinite and the exponent is real, the function will return NaN instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part of the number is greater than zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is positive or negative infinity. In the case of the `pow` function, if the base is infinite and the exponent has a positive imaginary part, the function will return the wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the base is equal to one, while `isIn
