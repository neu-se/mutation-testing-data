  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would not be called, and the long stack traces would not be generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would be called, and the long stack traces would be generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof hasStacks === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeStackTraceLong` function would be called if the `hasStacks` variable is undefined, and the long stack traces would be generated.

DONE.
