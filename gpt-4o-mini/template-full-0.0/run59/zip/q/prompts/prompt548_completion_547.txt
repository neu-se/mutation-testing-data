Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the caught exception, it would resolve the promise with a `null` value, potentially leading to unhandled promise states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a string message instead of the actual exception object, which may not provide useful debugging information about the error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error object that has a custom message, rather than the original exception, which could obscure the actual cause of the error.

DONE.
