  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is a different variable than `x`, and the code would be using the value of `y` instead of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `x + 1` is a different expression than `x`, and the code would be using the result of `x + 1` instead of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(x)` is a different expression than `x`, and the code would be using the result of `Math.sqrt(x)` instead of `x`.

DONE.
