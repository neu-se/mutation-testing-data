  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so it would not execute the task passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, which would cause the program to terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not execute the task passed to it, as `undefined` is not a function.

DONE.
