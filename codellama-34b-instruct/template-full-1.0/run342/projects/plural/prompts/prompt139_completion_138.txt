  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+word
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the word "1" followed by the original word, instead of the original word unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the word in uppercase, instead of the original word unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the word with the letters reversed, instead of the original word unchanged.

DONE.
