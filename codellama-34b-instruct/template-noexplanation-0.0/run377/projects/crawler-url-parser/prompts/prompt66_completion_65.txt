  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it splits the search string on the "=" character, which may produce different results if the search string contains multiple "=" characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")
```
This code fragment splits the search string on the "&" character, which is a common separator for query parameters in URLs. This may produce different results if the search string contains multiple query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("?")
```
This code fragment splits the search string on the "?" character, which is the separator between the path and the query string in a URL. This may produce different results if the search string contains multiple query parameters.

DONE.
