  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because substring takes a different argument than substr, which would cause the function to produce incorrect output in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because slice takes a different argument than substr, which would cause the function to produce incorrect output in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(-2)
```
This would result in different behavior because substr takes a negative argument, which would cause the function to produce incorrect output in certain cases.

DONE.
