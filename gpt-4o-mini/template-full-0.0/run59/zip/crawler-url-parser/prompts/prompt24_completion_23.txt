Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\?.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the query string (everything after the `?`) instead of the fragment (everything after the `#`), potentially altering the URL in a way that changes the parameters sent to the server.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*\?/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to match a fragment that is followed by a query string, which is not a valid URL structure. This could lead to incorrect parsing of URLs that contain both fragments and query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$|\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove both the fragment and any trailing slashes from the URL, which could lead to different URL resolutions and potentially affect how the URL is interpreted by the server.

DONE.
