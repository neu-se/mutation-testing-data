Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_context"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected type of the second argument from `QueryContext` to a string, which may cause the `rule.matches` method to behave incorrectly or throw an error, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the expected `ctx` may lead to the `rule.matches` method not being able to access necessary context information, potentially causing it to always return `false` or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the expected `ctx` may lead to the `rule.matches` method interpreting the absence of context differently, which could change the outcome of the match check and potentially allow paths that should be denied.

DONE.
