 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stack trace to a string, which may not have the desired format or properties for further processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack
