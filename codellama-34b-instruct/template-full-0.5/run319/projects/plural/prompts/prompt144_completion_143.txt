  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rule to be applied twice, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rule to be applied three times, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rule to be applied to a different rule, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
