 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.2 * Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the result is scaled by a factor of 1.2, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` calculates the base-10 logarithm, while the original code fragment calculates the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2 * Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the result is scaled by a factor of `Math.SQRT2`, which is approximately 1.41421356, and not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
