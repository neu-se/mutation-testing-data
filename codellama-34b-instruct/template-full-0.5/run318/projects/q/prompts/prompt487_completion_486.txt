  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the `unhandledRejections` array to 0, even if there were unhandled rejections in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the length of the `unhandledRejections` array to 1, even if there were no unhandled rejections in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = unhandledReasons.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the length of the `unhandledRejections` array to the length of the `unhandledReasons` array, even if there were no unhandled rejections in the queue.

DONE.
