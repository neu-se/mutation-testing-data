  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node:0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "js" substring would be missing from the logged message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because a different line number would be logged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node:2"
```
This would result in different behavior because a different file name would be logged.

DONE.
