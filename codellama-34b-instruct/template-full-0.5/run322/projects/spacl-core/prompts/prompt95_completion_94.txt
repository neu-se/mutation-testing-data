  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `push` method would not add the policy to the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the name of the policy, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Policy(policy.name, policy.actions)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new policy object with the same name and actions as the original policy, rather than using the original policy object.

DONE.
