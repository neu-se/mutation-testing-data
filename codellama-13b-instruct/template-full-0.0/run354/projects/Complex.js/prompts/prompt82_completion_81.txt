  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking for the imaginary unit "j" instead of "i".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I' || c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking for the imaginary unit "I" instead of "i".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be checking for the imaginary units "i", "I", "j", and "J".

DONE.
