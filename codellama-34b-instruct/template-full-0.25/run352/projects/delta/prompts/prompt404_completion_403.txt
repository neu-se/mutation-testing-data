  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of `otherData` and potentially cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if `otherData` was originally `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `otherData`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, even if `otherData` was originally `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the value of `otherData`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, even if `otherData` was originally `false`.

DONE.
