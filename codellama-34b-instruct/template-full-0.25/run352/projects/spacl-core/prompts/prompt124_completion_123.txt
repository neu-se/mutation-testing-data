  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `undefined` is a primitive value that is not equal to any string, including `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === "null"
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `"null"` is a string literal that is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `null` is a primitive value that is not equal to any string, including `match`.

DONE.
