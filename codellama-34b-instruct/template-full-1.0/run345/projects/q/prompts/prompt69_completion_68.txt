  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be sending a message through the same port that is used for receiving messages.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be sending a message through a different port, which may not be set up to handle messages in the same way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using the `postMessage` method of the `window` object, which is not related to the `MessageChannel` object.

DONE.
