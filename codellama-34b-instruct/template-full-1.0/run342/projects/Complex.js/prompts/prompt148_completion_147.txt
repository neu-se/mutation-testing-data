  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['isNaN']()` can return `true` for complex numbers that are not `NaN` (e.g. `Complex(Infinity, Infinity)`), while `z['isNaN']()` will only return `true` for complex numbers that are actually `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Complex` instance being constructed, and `isNaN()` will only return `true` for complex numbers that are actually `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['isInfinite']()` can return `true` for complex numbers that are not infinite (e.g. `Complex(NaN, NaN)`), while `z['isInfinite']()` will
