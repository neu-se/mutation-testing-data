Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `chop` method as a function, which may lead to runtime errors or unexpected results if `chop` is not intended to be called this way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from `chop` to `slice`, which alters the resulting `Delta` by only taking the first operation instead of processing the entire `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).push(new Op());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new operation to the `Delta`, which modifies the content of the `Delta` instead of simply returning the concatenated and chopped result, potentially leading to incorrect state or data.

DONE.
