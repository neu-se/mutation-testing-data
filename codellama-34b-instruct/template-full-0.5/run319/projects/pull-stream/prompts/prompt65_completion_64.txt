  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `null` as the first argument, even if `end` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `end` as the first argument, even if `end` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with `end` as the first argument, even if `end` is `null`.

DONE.
