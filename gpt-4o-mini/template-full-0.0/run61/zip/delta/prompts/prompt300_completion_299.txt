Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek().attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the attributes of the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling if the next operation is not the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1).attributes && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return an empty object if the attributes are defined, rather than returning the attributes themselves, which could lead to loss of necessary attribute information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ dummy: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected attributes with a static object, which does not reflect the actual attributes of the operation, potentially causing incorrect processing of the delta.

DONE.
