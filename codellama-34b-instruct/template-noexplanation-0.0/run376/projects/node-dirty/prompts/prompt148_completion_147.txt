  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.reverse()
```
This will cause the callbacks to be called in reverse order, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(0, -1)
```
This will cause the last callback to be omitted, which may cause the code to fail to perform some important action.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat(cbs)
```
This will cause the callbacks to be called twice, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
