  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, but this code checks for less than.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, but this code checks for greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x !== y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, but this code checks for inequality.

DONE.
