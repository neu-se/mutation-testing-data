  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the principal square root of `a * a + 1`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the negative of the principal square root of `a * a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the principal square root of `a * a + 1`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the principal square root of `a * a - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the principal square root of `a * a + 1`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the principal square root of `a * a + 2`.
