Mutation testing is a technique used in software testing to evaluate the efficacy of test suites by intentionally introducing bugs into the code and observing how the tests handle them. In this case, you want to apply mutation testing to the provided code to see if the tests are effective in detecting the bugs.

To apply mutation testing, you can start by making small, targeted changes to the code. For example, you could replace a `setImmediate` call with a `setTimeout` call with a longer duration. This would cause the code to behave differently, and you could observe how the tests handle this difference.

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `setTimeout(() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }, 1000)`. This would result in a one-second delay before the callback is called, which could cause the tests to fail if they are not designed to handle asynchronous code.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `setImmediate(() => { if (cb)
