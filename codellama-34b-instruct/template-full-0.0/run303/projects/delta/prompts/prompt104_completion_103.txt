  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return the opposite of what the original predicate function would return, effectively filtering out the opposite of what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would only return elements that satisfy the predicate function and have an even index, effectively filtering out every other element that satisfies the predicate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => predicate(op, index) || index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return all elements that satisfy the predicate function or have an index of 0, effectively returning the first element and all elements that satisfy the predicate.

DONE.
