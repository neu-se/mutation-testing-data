  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value 2, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the value of the `Q` constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the value of the `Q` constant and 1, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the value of the `Q` constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference between the value of the `Q` constant and 1, which is different from the original code fragment that returns the value of the `Q` constant.

DONE.
