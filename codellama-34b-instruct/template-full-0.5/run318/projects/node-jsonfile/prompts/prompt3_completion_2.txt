  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.toString()` would return the string representation of the `file` object, while `file` alone would return the `file` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.length` would return the length of the `file` object, while `file` alone would return the `file` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.name` would return the name of the `file` object, while `file` alone would return the `file` object itself.

DONE.
