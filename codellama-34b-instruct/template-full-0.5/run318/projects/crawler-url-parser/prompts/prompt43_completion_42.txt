  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a different set of properties, which could affect the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return `null`, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access the `host` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return an empty object, which would cause the code to throw an error when trying to access the `host` property.

DONE.
