  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper` expects a single argument, but would now be called with two arguments, causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper` expects a data object as its argument, but would now be called with the `abort` flag instead, causing a logic bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper` expects a non-null data object as its argument, but would now be called with `null`, causing a runtime error.

DONE.
