 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function with an empty block does not have the same behavior as the original `_writeFile` function. The original function is assigned to the `writeFile` constant, while the arrow function does not assign the function to any constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.writeFile`, while the original `_writeFile` function is asynchronous. This change would make the `writeFile`
