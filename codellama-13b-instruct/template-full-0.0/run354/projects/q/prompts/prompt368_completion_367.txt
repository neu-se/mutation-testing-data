  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a function definition. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are expecting a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a reference to the function. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are expecting a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the new code fragment is a function definition. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are expecting a function call.

DONE.
