  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `delete` property of `otherOp`, which is not the intended behavior of the code. The original code fragment compares the `insert` property of `thisOp` with the `insert` property of `otherOp`, which is the correct behavior.

DONE.
