  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have a `dispatch` method, unlike `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `dispatch` method, unlike `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not the same object as `Q` in the current context, and does not have a `dispatch` method.

DONE.
