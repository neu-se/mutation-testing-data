  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `false`. This could cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === undefined ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `undefined`. This could cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.
