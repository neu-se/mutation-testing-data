  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would return `null` instead of a function, which would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would return `undefined` instead of a function, which would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would return itself instead of a function, which would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
