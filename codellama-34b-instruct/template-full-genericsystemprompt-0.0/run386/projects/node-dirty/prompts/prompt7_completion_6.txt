  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the data to be stored at a different location in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be converted to uppercase, which would cause the data to be stored at a different location in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be reversed, which would cause the data to be stored at a different location in the map.

DONE.
