  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return finalise().reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalise() function returns a string, but the reverse() function is being called on the string, so the finalise() function would return a reversed version of the string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return finalise().split('');
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalise() function returns a string, but the split() function is being called on the string, so the finalise() function would return an array of single characters, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return finalise().slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalise() function returns a string, but the slice() function is being called on the string with a start index of 1, so the finalise() function would return the string without the first character, which is not the intended behavior.
