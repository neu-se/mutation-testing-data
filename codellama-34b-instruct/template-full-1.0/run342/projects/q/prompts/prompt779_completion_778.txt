  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` is a method that returns a promise, so the code would no longer be passing the `promise` itself to `allSettled()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch()` is a method that returns a promise, so the code would no longer be passing the `promise` itself to `allSettled()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `catch()` would be treated as a new, separate promise, and would not be included in the result of `allSettled()`.

DONE.
