  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void` operator would return undefined, which would likely cause an error in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "null" would be passed as a parameter to the `Q.nearer()` function, which would likely cause an error because it expects a promise or an immediate value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
