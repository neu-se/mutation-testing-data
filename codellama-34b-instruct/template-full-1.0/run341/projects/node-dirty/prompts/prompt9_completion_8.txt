  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is expecting a key-value pair, but would receive a value-key pair instead, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, val
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is expecting a key-value pair, but would receive a `null` key, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is expecting a key-value pair, but would receive a `undefined` value, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
