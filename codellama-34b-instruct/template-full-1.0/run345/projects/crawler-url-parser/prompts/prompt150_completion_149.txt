  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to split the input string into an array of substrings. Replacing it with `null` would cause an error, indicating that the code is not handling the case where the input string is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to split the input string into an array of substrings. Replacing it with an empty string would cause an error, indicating that the code is not handling the case where the input string is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
", "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a single slash (/) in the input string, but this replacement would cause the input string to be split into an array of substrings using a different separator (a comma and a space). This would likely cause the code to behave differently and would highlight
