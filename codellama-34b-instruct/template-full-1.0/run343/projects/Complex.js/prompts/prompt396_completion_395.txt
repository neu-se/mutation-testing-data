  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the squared value of the sine of the complex number, and `-b` would be the squared value of the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment divides by `d`, which is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. If we add `2`, we're changing the denominator, which would affect the resulting quotient.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment divides the numerator and denominator by `2`, which would halve the final result.

DONE.
