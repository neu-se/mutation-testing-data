  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `true` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed with the `true` option, which could result in different behavior when the URL is parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `null` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed at all, which could result in different behavior when the URL is parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `undefined` option, which means that the URL would not be parsed with any option, which could result in different behavior when the URL is parsed.

DONE.
