  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that have different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in a different value for `d` since `c` is different from `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in a different value for `d` since `2*b` is different from `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*c
```
This would result in a different value for `d` since `b*c` is different from `b`.

DONE.
