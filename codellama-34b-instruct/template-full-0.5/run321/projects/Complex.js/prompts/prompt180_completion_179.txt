  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined for the `Complex` class.

DONE.
