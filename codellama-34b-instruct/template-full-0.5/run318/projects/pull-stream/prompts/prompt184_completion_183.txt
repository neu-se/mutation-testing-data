  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator `i` would be decremented instead of incremented, which would cause the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i+1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator `i` would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the function to skip over the next element in the array and return the one after that.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i*2])
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator `i` would be multiplied by 2 instead of being incremented, which would cause the function to return every other element in the array instead of every element.

DONE.
