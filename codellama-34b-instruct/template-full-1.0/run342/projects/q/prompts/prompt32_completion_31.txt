  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in no function being called, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in an error being thrown, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("hello world")
```
This would result in a message being logged to the console, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
