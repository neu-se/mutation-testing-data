  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to access the first element of the array, which is not what the original code was doing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to access the last element of the array, which is not what the original code was doing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to access an undefined element of the array, which is not what the original code was doing.

DONE.
