  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value after the specified time, while `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error after the specified time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.then` returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the given function, while `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error after the specified time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` returns a promise that is resolved with the result of the given function, while `Q.timeout` returns a promise that is rejected with an error after the specified time.

DONE.
