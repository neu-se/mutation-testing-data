  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the argument, whereas Math.floor returns the largest integer less than or equal to the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.round returns the nearest integer to the argument, whereas Math.floor returns the largest integer less than or equal to the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.abs returns the absolute value of the argument, whereas Math.floor and Math.ceil return the largest or smallest integer less than or equal to the argument, respectively.

DONE.
