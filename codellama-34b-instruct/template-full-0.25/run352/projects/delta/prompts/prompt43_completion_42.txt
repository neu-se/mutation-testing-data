  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant, which is a string with a single character (the null character), instead of the expected string with a single character (the zero character).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant, which is a string with a single character (the null character), instead of the expected string with a single character (the letter "a").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant, which is a string with a single character (the null character), instead of the expected string with a single character (the space character).

DONE.
