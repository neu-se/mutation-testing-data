Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` flag changes the regex to replace all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the first occurrence, potentially altering the intended path manipulation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[0-9]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the character class from `[a-z]` to `[0-9]` means that the regex will only match files with numeric extensions (e.g., `.123`), ignoring any alphabetic extensions (e.g., `.html`), which could lead to incorrect path handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the original regex with one that only matches `/index` files means that the code will no longer handle `/default` files, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution for paths that should be normalized.

DONE.
