  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`otherData`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the second operand of the `transform` method instead of the first operand, which could potentially lead to a different resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Delta.getHandler(embedType).invert(opData, baseOpData)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `invert` method of the embed handler instead of the `transform` method, which could potentially lead to a different resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Delta.getHandler(embedType).transform(opData, otherData)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `transform` method of the embed handler with a different second argument, which could potentially lead to a different resulting delta.

DONE.
