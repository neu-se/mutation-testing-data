  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the attributes of the next operation to the predicate function, while this modified code passes an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, this.ops[i].attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the attributes of the current operation to the predicate function, while this modified code passes the attributes of the operation at index `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the predicate function returns `false`, while this modified code checks if the predicate function returns a falsy value.

DONE.
