  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be subtracting 2 from the length of the word, rather than 1. This could potentially cause the code to produce incorrect results for certain words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be subtracting 3 from the length of the word, rather than 1. This could potentially cause the code to produce incorrect results for certain words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be subtracting 4 from the length of the word, rather than 1. This could potentially cause the code to produce incorrect results for certain words.

DONE.
