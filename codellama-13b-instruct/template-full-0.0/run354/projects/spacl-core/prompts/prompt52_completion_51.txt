  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would be pushed to the `parts` array, which would cause the resulting regular expression to match any string that ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be pushed to the `parts` array, which would cause the resulting regular expression to match any string that ends with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be pushed to the `parts` array, which would cause the resulting regular expression to match any string that ends with a slash.

DONE.
