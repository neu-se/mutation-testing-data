Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the current promise to the next promise in a hypothetical linked list, potentially skipping over promises and leading to incomplete stack traces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `p` to `null`, causing the loop to terminate immediately and preventing any stack traces from being collected, which would lead to loss of error context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference to the parent promise instead of the current promise, which could lead to incorrect stack trace information if the parent promise does not have the expected stack structure.

DONE.
