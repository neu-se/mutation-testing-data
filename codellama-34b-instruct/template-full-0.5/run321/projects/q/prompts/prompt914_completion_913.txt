  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive a `null` value instead of the `arguments` object, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of an array containing the function's arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an `undefined` value instead of the `arguments` object, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of an array containing the function's arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an empty array instead of the `arguments` object, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of an array containing the function's arguments.

DONE.
