  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function is used to check if the `promise` exists in the `unhandledRejections` array. If the function returns -1, it means that the `promise` does not exist in the array, and the process emits the "unhandledRejection" event, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return unhandledRejections.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function is used to check if the `promise` exists in the `unhandledRejections` array. If the function returns the length of the array, it means that the `promise` exists in the array more than once, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.floor(Math.random() * unhandledRejections.length);
```
This would
