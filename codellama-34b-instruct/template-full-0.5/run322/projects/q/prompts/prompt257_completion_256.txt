  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called instead of `fulfill`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is called instead of `reject`, causing the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is called instead of `fulfill` or `reject`, causing the promise to be resolved with a resolved promise instead of being resolved or rejected directly.

DONE.
