  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `hostname` is a different property of the `URL` object than `host`, and it would return the hostname without the port number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host + ':' + ret.port
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the port number in the hostname, which may not be present in the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.split(':')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the hostname, which may not be the same as the hostname without the port number.

DONE.
