  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `temp`, potentially causing the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `temp`, potentially causing the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/ 2` operation would change the value of `temp`, potentially causing the `atan2` function to return a different value.

DONE.
