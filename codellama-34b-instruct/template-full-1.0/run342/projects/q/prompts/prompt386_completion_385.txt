  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, which is not the same as `callback.fcall`, which refers to a method of the `callback` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with the provided reason, while `callback.fcall` is a method that calls the promise with the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.throw` throws an exception, while `callback.fcall` calls the promise with the provided arguments and may or may not result in an exception being thrown.

DONE.
