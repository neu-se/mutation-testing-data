  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout ID, which could cause the timeout to not be cleared and the error to not be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout ID, which could cause the timeout to not be cleared and the error to not be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the timeout ID 0, which could cause the timeout to not be cleared and the error to not be thrown.

DONE.
