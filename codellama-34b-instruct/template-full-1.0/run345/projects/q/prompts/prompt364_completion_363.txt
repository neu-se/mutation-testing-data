  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to undefined, whereas the original code fragment does not change the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to null, whereas the original code fragment does not change the value.

DONE.
