Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the current operation at `this.index`, returning all subsequent operations starting from the next index instead of including the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index, this.index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the current operation at `this.index` instead of all remaining operations, which changes the expected output of the `rest` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all operations before the current index, effectively omitting all operations from the current index onward, which is not the intended functionality of the `rest` method.

DONE.
