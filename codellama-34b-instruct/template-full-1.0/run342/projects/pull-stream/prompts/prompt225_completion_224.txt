  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(filter(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` and `!filter` have different truthy and falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && !filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional condition to the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!filter(data) || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, and the precedence of the operators.

DONE.
