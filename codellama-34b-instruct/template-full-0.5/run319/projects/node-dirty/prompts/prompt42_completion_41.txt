  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to skip over any keys that are `undefined`, even if they have a value associated with them in the cache.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to skip over any keys that are `null`, even if they have a value associated with them in the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the keys in the cache, rather than the values associated with those keys.

DONE.
