  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) < Complex['EPSILON'] &&
  Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to compare the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, while the new code fragment uses the `<` operator to compare the absolute values of the differences between the real and imaginary parts. This could result in different behavior in cases where the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers are very close to each other but not exactly equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['re'] - this['re']) <= Complex['EPSILON'] &&
  Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator to compare the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers
