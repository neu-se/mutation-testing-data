  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would always return a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library and `Q()` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object, whereas `Q()` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all promises in an array are fulfilled, whereas `Q()` is a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
