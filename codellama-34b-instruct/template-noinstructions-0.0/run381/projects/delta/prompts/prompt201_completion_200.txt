  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the concatenated delta, which removes any trailing retain ops with a length of 0, while the new code fragment does not call the `chop()` method, so the resulting delta may contain trailing retain ops with a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop()` method on the concatenated delta with no arguments, which removes any trailing retain ops with a length of 0, while the new code fragment calls the `chop()` method with an argument of 0, which removes any trailing retain ops with a length of 0 or less.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop(1)
```
This would result in different
