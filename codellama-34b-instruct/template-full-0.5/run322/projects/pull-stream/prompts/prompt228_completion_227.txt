  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the value of `data` directly, while this replacement code fragment is checking the value of `data + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the value of `data` directly, while this replacement code fragment is checking the value of `data * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the value of `data` directly, while this replacement code fragment is checking the length of `data`.

DONE.
