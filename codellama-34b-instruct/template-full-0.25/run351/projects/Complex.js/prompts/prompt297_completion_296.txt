  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is being applied to the wrong variable. The original code fragment applies `sinh` to `b`, but the replaced code fragment applies it to `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is being applied to the wrong variable. The original code fragment applies `cosh` to `b`, but the replaced code fragment applies it to `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is being applied to the wrong variable. The original code fragment applies `tanh` to `b`, but the replaced code fragment applies it to `a`.

DONE.
