 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method may return an empty string for some input types, causing the function to return null incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat falsy values (e.g., `0`, `null`, `undefined`) as empty strings, potentially causing the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String()` constructor can treat some input types differently than the original code, causing the function to return null incorrectly.

These changes introduce different behavior compared to the original code, which could help reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
