  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with an incorrect number of arguments. The original code fragment passes `null` as the first argument, but this new code fragment passes `done` as the first argument, which is not a valid argument for the `drain` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.call(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with a different `this` context. The original code fragment passes `null` as the `this` context, but this new code fragment passes `done` as the `this` context, which is not a valid `this` context for the `drain` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.apply(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is called with a different set of arguments. The original code
