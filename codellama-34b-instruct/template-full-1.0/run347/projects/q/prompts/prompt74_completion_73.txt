  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the number of milliseconds passed to `setTimeout` is different. In the original code, the callback function `flush` is called after a delay of 0 milliseconds. In the mutated code, the callback function `flush` is called after a delay of 10 milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `timeout` is called instead of `flush`. The `timeout` function is not defined in the provided code, so it would result in a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `requestTick` is called instead of `flush`. The `requestTick` function is not defined in the provided code, so it would result in a reference error.

DONE.
