  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 0 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to execute one less time than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last index of the arguments array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to execute one more time than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle index of the arguments array instead of the first, which could cause the loop to execute one less time than expected if the length of the arguments array is odd.

DONE.
