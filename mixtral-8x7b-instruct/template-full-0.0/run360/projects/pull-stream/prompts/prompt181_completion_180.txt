 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function passed in as an argument is not being called, which is different from the original behavior of invoking `onAbort` when the `abort` flag is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would receive `null` as the third argument instead of the `onAbort` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the error handling or callback mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would receive a number (123) as the third argument instead of the `onAbort` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the error handling or callback mechanism.

DONE.
