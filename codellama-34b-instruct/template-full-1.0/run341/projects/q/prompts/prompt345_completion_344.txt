  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause an exception to be thrown, which will be caught by the `catch` block and the rejected promise will be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly return a rejected promise with the error object.

DONE.
