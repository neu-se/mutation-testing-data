  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return "error" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now always return the string "error", regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return Math.random() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now return a random number between 0 and 1, rather than the original word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now return the uppercase version of the original word, rather than the original word.

DONE.
