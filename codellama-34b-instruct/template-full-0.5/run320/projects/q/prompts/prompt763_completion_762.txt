  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called on the `Q` promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the original code fragment resolved the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called on the `Q` promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved, even if the original code fragment rejected the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the `Q` promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the `then` method, even if the original code fragment rejected the promise.

DONE.
