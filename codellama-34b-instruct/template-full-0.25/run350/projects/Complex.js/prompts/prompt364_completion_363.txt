  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a positive sign, while the new code fragment has a negative sign. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has no constant added to the complex number, while the new code fragment adds 1 to the complex number. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has no constant multiplied by the complex number, while the new code fragment multiplies the complex number by 2. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase.

DONE.
