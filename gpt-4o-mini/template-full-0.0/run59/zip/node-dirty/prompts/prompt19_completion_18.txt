Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the queue for the key with an empty array, effectively discarding any callbacks that were previously associated with that key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.concat());
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the callbacks array, which means that any modifications to the original `cbs` array after this point will not affect the callbacks stored in `_queue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the queue for the key to `null`, which would lead to errors when trying to access or invoke callbacks later, as the code expects an array of callbacks.

DONE.
