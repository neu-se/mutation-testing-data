  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different event, "rejectionHandled", instead of "unhandledRejection".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the reason as the third argument instead of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection", reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass null as the third argument instead of the promise.

DONE.
