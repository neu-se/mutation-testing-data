  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would stop iterating through the lines of the `Delta` object and return a `Delta` object with the first line replaced with a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would stop iterating through the lines of the `Delta` object and return a `Delta` object with the first line replaced with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would stop iterating through the lines of the `Delta` object and return a `Delta` object with the first line replaced with a null value.

DONE.
