  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the `invoke` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing the `object` argument, instead of an array containing the `name` and `args` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['foo', 'bar']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing the `object` argument, followed by the elements of the `['foo', 'bar']` array, instead of an array containing the `name` and `args` arguments.

DONE.
