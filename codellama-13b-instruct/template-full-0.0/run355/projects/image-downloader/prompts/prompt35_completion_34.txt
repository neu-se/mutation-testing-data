  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `pipe` method to pipe the response data to the write stream, while the modified code fragment uses the `pipe` method to pipe the response data to the write stream and then calls the `end` method on the write stream. This would result in the write stream being closed before the response data is fully written to it, which could cause the write stream to be truncated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `pipe` method to pipe the response data to the write stream, while the modified code fragment uses the `pipe` method to pipe the response data to the write stream and then calls the `end` method on the write stream. This would result in the write stream being closed before the response data is fully written to it, which could cause the write stream to be truncated.
