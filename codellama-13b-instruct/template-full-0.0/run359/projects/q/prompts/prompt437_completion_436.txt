  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array_indexOf` function to search for the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, while the buggy code fragment uses the `indexOf` function, which is not defined in the code. This would cause the code to throw a ReferenceError and fail to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array_indexOf` function to search for the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, while the buggy code fragment uses the `indexOf` method of the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not defined in the code. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError and fail to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result
