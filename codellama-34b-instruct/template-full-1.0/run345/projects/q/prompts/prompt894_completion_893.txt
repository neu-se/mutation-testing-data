  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that prints a message to the console, but it does not return a value and will not cause a promise to resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that will be returned as-is and will not cause a promise to resolve or reject.

DONE.
