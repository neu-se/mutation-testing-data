  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` is the negation of `Number.isFinite`, which checks if a value is a finite number. Using `!Number.isFinite` would cause the code to treat non-finite numbers as if they were finite, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), which is different from `Number.isFinite`, which checks if a value is a finite number. Using `Number.isNaN` would cause the code to treat NaN values differently than it would with `Number.isFinite`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer, which is different from `Number
