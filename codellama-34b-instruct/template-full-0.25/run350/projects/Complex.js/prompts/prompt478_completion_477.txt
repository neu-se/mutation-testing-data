  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, while `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` checks if a value is not a finite number, while `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite, while `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number.

DONE.
