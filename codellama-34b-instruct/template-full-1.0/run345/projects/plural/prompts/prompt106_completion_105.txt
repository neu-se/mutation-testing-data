  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the output of the plural function for words that end in -s, which would cause the plural form to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the output of the plural function for words that end in -s, which would cause the plural form to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp
