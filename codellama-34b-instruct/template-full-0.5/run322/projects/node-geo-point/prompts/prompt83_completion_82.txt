  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the calculated latitude of the destination point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point. Using `φ2` instead of `φ1` would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a destination point with the same latitude as the starting point, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the starting point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the starting point. Using `λ1` instead of `φ1` would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a destination point with the same longitude as the starting point, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `φ1` is the latitude
