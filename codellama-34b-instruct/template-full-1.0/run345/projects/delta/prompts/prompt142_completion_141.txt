  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the peekLength method expects an integer as input, but <PLACEHOLDER> is a string. This would cause the method to throw an exception if it is not handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the next method advances the iterator to the next element, which is not what we want if we are trying to compare the current element with the first element of the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the peek method returns the current element of the iterator without advancing it, which is what we want if we are trying to compare the current element with the first element of the other iterator.

DONE.
