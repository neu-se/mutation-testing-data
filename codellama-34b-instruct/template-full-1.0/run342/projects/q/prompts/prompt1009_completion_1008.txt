  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 1 as the index for the slice method, but 10 as the index would reference a different element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 1 as the index for the slice method, but nodeArgs.length would reference the last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 1 as the index for the slice method, but -1 would reference the last element in the array.

DONE.
