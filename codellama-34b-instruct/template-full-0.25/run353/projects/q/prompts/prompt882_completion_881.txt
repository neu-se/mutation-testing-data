  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the promise returned by `this.fapply(nodeArgs)`, which could cause the promise to be resolved even if the function call fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `this.fapply(nodeArgs)`, but the failure handler is an empty function, which could cause the promise to be resolved even if the function call fails.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called twice on the promise returned by `this.fapply(nodeArgs)`, once with the `de
