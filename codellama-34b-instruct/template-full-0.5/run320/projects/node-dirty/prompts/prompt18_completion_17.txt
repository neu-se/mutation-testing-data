  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array, while `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the `set` method is called multiple times with the same `key`, the new array would be created each time, while the original array would be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of `cbs` with the elements of another array, while `cbs` is a reference to the original array. If the `set` method is called multiple times with the same `key`, the new array would be created each time, while the original array would be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(cb => cb !==
