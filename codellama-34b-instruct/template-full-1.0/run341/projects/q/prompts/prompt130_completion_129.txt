  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++i
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `i` is a variable that is being incremented by 1, while in this option, `++i` would increment `i` by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `i` is a variable that is being incremented by 1, while in this option, `i++` would increment `i` by 1, but it would happen after the expression is evaluated, which means the value of `i` in the array would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `i` is a variable that is being incremented by 1, while in this option, `i + 1` would add 1 to the value of `i`, but it would not assign the result back to `
