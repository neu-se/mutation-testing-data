  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `npost` method to call a method of a Node-style object that accepts a Node-style callback with a given array of arguments, plus a provided callback. The buggy code fragment would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `ninvoke` method to call a method of a Node-style object that accepts a Node-style callback, forwarding the given variadic arguments, plus a provided callback argument. The buggy code fragment would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `nfapply` method to call a Node function, which is called with the given arguments
