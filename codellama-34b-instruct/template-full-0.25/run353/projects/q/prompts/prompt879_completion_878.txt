  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an additional `true` argument, which would cause the resolver to be called with an additional `true` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an additional `false` argument, which would cause the resolver to be called with an additional `false` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an additional `null` argument, which would cause the resolver to be called with an additional `null` argument, which would
