  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the "rejectionHandled" event with the reason and promise, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the "rejectionHandled" event with the reason, but not the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the "rejectionHandled" event with the promise, but not the reason.

DONE.
