  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to remove all text after the first occurrence of ";" in the "href" attribute, which may be different from the original intention of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to remove all text after the last occurrence of ";" in the "href" attribute, which may be different from the original intention of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/^[^;]*;/,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to remove all text before the first occurrence of ";" in the "href" attribute, which may be different from the original intention of the code.

DONE.
