  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number `z`, whereas `z['re']` is the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re'] + 1` is the real part of the complex number `z` plus one, whereas `z['re']` is the real part of the complex number `z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['im'] + 1` is the imaginary part of the complex number `z` plus one, whereas `z['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number `z`.

DONE.
