  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has been removed, which changes the logic of the condition. The original code fragment checks if `end` is falsy and `test(data)` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and `test(data)` is falsy.

DONE.
