Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other element in the `answerPs` array, potentially leading to unresolved promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements `i`, which would create an infinite loop since `i` would never reach the length of `answerPs`, preventing the loop from terminating.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
len = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `len` to 0, causing the loop condition to always evaluate to false, and thus the loop would never execute, resulting in no promises being processed.

DONE.
