  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] = "new reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `unhandledReasons` array by replacing the current element with a new reason.

DONE.
