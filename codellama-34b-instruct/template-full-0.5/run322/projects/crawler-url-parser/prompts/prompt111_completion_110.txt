  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr.substring(1)` would return the substring of `baseUrlStr` starting from the second character, which would be different from `baseUrlStr` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of `baseUrlStr`, which would be different from `baseUrlStr` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')` would return the reverse of `baseUrlStr`, which would be different from `baseUrlStr` itself.

DONE.
