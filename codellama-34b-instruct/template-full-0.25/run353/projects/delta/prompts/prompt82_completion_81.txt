  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is being set to a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { foo: 'bar' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property is being set to a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is being set to a different value than the original code.

DONE.
