  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that start with "//", while this new code fragment matches URLs that start with "http://" or "https://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:http|https):\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that start with "//", while this new code fragment matches URLs that start with "http://" or "https://" using a non-capturing group.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:https?):\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that start with "//", while this new code fragment matches URLs that start with "http://" or "https://" using a non-capturing group and the "s" flag to match "https" as well.

DONE.
