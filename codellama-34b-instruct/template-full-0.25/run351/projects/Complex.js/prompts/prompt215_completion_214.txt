  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them, which would change the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `b` from `a` instead of multiplying them, which would change the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` and `b` instead of adding them, which would change the result of the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
