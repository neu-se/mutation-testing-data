  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and it would cause the timeout to continue running indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be called after a certain amount of time, whereas `clearTimeout` is a function that cancels a previously scheduled timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout than the one that was originally set, which could cause the timeout to continue running indefinitely.

DONE.
