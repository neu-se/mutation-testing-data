  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not an object and not null. If `b` is null, the original code fragment would return true, but the new code fragment would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' || b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is not an object or null, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not an object or undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code fragment would return true, but the new code fragment would return false.
