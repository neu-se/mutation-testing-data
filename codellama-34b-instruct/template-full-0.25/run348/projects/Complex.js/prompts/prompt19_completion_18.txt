  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hypot` function to always return `x`, regardless of the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hypot` function to always return `y + 1`, regardless of the value of `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `hypot` function to always return `x * y`, regardless of the value of `x` and `y`.

DONE.
