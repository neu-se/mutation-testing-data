  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor position would be off by one, potentially causing the `diff` function to miscalculate the difference between the two strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings in the `diff` function would be swapped, potentially causing incorrect results to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cursor` parameter would be set to `false`, which would cause the `diff` function to behave differently when computing the difference between the two strings.

DONE.
