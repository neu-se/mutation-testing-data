  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if `plus` is greater than 0, regardless of the value of `minus`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if `minus` is greater than 0, regardless of the value of `plus`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if the difference between `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0, regardless of the values of `plus` and `minus` individually.

DONE.
