  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` constructor expects a non-zero value as the first argument, and passing `1` would create a different channel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` constructor expects a string as the first argument, and passing `"foo"` would create a channel with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `MessageChannel` constructor expects a number as the first argument, and passing `Math.PI` would create a channel with a different value.

DONE.
