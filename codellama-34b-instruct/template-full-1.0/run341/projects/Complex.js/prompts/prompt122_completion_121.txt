  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = z['im'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the imaginary part of the divisor to the real part of the dividend, instead of the real part of the divisor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = z['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the real part of the divisor to the imaginary part of the dividend, instead of the real part of the dividend.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c = d = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the real and imaginary parts of the divisor to 0, effectively making the divisor 0, which would cause the resulting complex number to be (NaN, NaN) instead of the correct result.

DONE.
