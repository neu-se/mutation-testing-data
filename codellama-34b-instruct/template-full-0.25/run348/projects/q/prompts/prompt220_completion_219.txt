  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `process.env.Q_DEBUG`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if `process.env.Q_DEBUG` is strictly equal to `true`, and would otherwise evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `process.env.Q_DEBUG` is not strictly equal to `false`, and would otherwise evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
