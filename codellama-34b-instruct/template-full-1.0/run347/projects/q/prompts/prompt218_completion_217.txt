  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected, instead of resolved, and all the code that assumes the promise is resolved, like the forEach loop, would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { reject(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise, and all the code that assumes the promise is resolved, like the forEach loop, would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an undefined value, and the forEach loop would not be executed.

DONE.
