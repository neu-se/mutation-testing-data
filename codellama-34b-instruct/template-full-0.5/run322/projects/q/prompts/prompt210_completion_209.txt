  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of numbers, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
