  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos()` function is applied to `point2Rad` instead of `point1Rad`, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos()` function is applied to the sum of `point1Rad` and `point2Rad`, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad - point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos()` function is applied to the difference of `point1Rad` and `point2Rad`, which could lead to a different calculation of the distance between the two points.

DONE.
