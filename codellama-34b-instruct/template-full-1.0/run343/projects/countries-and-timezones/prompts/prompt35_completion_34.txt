  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input value, which would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * input
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the input value, which would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the input value to 0, which would cause the `getOffsetStr` function to produce a different output.

DONE.
