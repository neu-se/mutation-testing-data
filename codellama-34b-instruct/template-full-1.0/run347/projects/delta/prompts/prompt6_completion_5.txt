  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<Without the ">", asObject: [key: string] => any),
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `asObject` method to cast the `string` to a `Map`, which would fail in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<Without the ">", asString: (value: any) => string),
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `asString` method to cast the `value` to a `string`, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<Without the ">", asNumber: (value: any) => number),
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `asNumber` method to cast the `value` to a `number`, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
