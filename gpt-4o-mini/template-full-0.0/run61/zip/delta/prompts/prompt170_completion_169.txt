Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push a delete operation with a length of 0, which may not accurately represent the intended delete operation from `thisIter.next()`, potentially leading to incorrect delta composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a delete operation with a length that is one greater than the actual length of the operation being processed, which could lead to an incorrect representation of the operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a delete operation that only considers a length of 1, regardless of the actual length of the operation, potentially leading to data loss or incorrect delta composition.

DONE.
