  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would return an abort error, while `null` would return a null error, which may not be handled properly in the test cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would return an abort error, while `''` would return an empty string, which may not be handled properly in the test cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would return an abort error, while `NaN` would return a Not a Number error, which may not be handled properly in the test cases.

DONE.
