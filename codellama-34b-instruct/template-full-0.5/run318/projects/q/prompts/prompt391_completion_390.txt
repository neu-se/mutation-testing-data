  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `progressed` function, which could lead to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is passed as the `progressed` argument, which could cause the `when` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is passed as the `progressed` argument, which could cause the `when` function to throw an error.

DONE.
