  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `x` variable, but the replaced code fragment uses both `x` and `y` variables, which may have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `x` variable, but the replaced code fragment multiplies `x` and `y`, which may have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uses the `x` variable, but the replaced code fragment divides `x` by `y`, which may have different values.

DONE.
