  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the fulfilled value of the promise to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw reason;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not pass the rejected reason to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return { resolved: value };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an object with a `resolved` property instead of the fulfilled value of the promise to the callback.

DONE.
