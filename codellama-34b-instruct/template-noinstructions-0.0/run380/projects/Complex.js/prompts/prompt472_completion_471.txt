  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isZero
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if a value is zero, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

DONE.
