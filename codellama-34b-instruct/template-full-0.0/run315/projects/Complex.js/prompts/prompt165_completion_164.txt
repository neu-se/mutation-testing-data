  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, while the replacement code fragment is a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, while the replacement code fragment is an assignment statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call, while the replacement code fragment is a function definition.

DONE.
