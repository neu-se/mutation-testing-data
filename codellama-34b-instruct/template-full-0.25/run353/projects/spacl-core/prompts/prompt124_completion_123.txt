  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a `RegExpMatchArray` object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. In the original code, `match` is compared to `null` to check if it is a valid match. If `match` is `undefined`, it means that the regular expression did not match the input string, and the code will return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match.length` is the number of matches found by the regular expression. If `match.length` is 0, it means that the regular expression did not find any matches, and the code will return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match[0]` is the first match found by the regular expression. If `match[0]` is `undefined`, it
