 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately calls the function, instead of passing a reference to it. The original code passes a reference to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which is then called with the correct arguments at a later time. By immediately calling the function, we are changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and therefore cannot be called like `deferred.reject`. The original code passes a reference to the `makeNodeResolver` function, which is then called with the correct arguments at a later time. By replacing it with `null`, we are changing the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is not the same as `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`.
