  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildTimezone` is a different function than `buildCountry`, and it returns a different type of object (a timezone object instead of a country object).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` takes an additional `options` argument that is not present in the original code, which would cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...Object.values(data.countries)[id], ...options }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different object than the original code, which would affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
