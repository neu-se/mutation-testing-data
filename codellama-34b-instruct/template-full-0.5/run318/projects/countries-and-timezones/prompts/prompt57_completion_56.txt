  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, causing the code to always return `true` regardless of whether the country is already in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator is used instead of `!=` to check if the country is already in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `!=` to check if the country is already in the `countries` object.

DONE.
