 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `inverted.delete` removes an operation from the delta, while `inverted.retain` would keep the operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `inverted.delete` adds the operation to the delta when it is inverted, while `inverted.push` would add a copy of the operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
inverted['noSuchMethod']
