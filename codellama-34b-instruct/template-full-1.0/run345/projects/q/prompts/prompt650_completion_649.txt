  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is called when a promise is fulfilled, while `dispatch` is a method that is used to handle errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that is called when a promise is rejected, while `dispatch` is a method that is used to handle errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that is called when a promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected), while `dispatch` is a method that is used to handle errors.

DONE.
