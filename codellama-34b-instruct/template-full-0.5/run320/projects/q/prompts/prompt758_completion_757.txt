  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because "any" is a different method than "allSettled" and would return a promise for the first resolved promise of an array, prior rejected promises are ignored, and rejects only if all promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allResolved" is a different method than "allSettled" and would wait for all promises to be settled, either fulfilled or rejected, and the promise returned by "allResolved" will never be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fail"
```
This would result in different behavior because "fail" is a different method than "allSettled" and would capture the failure of a promise, giving an opportunity to recover with a callback.

DONE.
