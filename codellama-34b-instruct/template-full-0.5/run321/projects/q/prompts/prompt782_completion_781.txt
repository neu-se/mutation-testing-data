  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called three times instead of twice, potentially causing unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, noop, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called instead of `regardless`, which would not have any effect on the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop, noop, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called only once instead of twice, potentially causing unintended side effects.

DONE.
