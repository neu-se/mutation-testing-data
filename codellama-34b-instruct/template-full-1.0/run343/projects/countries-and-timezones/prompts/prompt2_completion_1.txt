  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `getTimezonesMap.current` assuming that `getTimezonesMap` returns an object with a property named `current`. This would result in an error because `getTimezonesMap.current` is not a function and cannot be called with the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `data.timezones[id]` assuming that `data.timezones` is an array of timezone objects. This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same timezone object with the corresponding `id` key, regardless of whether it is the `current` or `all` timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `data.timezones.all[id]` assuming that `data.timezones.all` is an array of timezone objects. This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same timezone object with the corresponding `id` key from the `all` array, regardless of whether it is the `current` or `all` timezone.

DONE.
