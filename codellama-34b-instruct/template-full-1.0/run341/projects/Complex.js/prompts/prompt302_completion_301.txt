  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cosh` is called with `b` as its argument, which gives the hyperbolic cosine of `b`. However, if we replace `b` with `2 * b`, the function will compute the hyperbolic cosine of `2 * b`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cosh` is called with `b` as its argument, which gives the hyperbolic cosine of `b`. However, if we replace `b` with `a + b`, the function will compute the hyperbolic cosine of `a + b`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cosh` is called with `b`
