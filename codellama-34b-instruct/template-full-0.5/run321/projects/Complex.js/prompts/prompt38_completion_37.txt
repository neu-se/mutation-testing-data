  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a logical AND operator, while the mutated code uses a logical OR operator. This change would cause the function to return a different result for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a logical AND operator, while the mutated code uses a logical OR operator. This change would cause the function to return a different result for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 || _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used a logical AND operator, while the mutated code uses a logical OR operator. This change would cause the function to return a different result for certain input values.
