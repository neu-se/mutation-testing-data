  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element in the slice, which may be important for the correctness of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra element in the slice, which may cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra element in the slice, which may cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
