  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would no longer be able to match the `length` variable, and the `default` case would be executed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would no longer be able to match the `length` variable, and the `default` case would be executed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would no longer be able to match the `length` variable, and the `default` case would be executed instead.

DONE.
