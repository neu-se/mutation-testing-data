  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would refer to the wrong option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a valid path')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the path is invalid, rather than required.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a directory')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would indicate that the path is not a directory, rather than required.

DONE.
