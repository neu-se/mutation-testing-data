 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > this.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a condition that is the opposite of the original code fragment. The original code checks if the index is negative, while this change checks if the index is greater than the length of the Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index >= this.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a condition that is slightly different from the original code fragment. The original code checks if the index is strictly negative, while this change checks if the index is non-positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index === -1
