  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `forEach` loop to iterate over the indices of the `answerPs` array, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to start at the second element of the `answerPs` array, rather than the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to start at the second-to-last element of the `answerPs` array, rather than the first.

DONE.
