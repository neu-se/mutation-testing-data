  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the context of the `inspect` method to the current object, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with the context of the current object, which would result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
