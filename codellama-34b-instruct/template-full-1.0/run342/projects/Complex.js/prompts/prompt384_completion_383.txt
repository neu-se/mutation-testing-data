  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the given code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable, which could cause issues in the calculations for the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `b` variable, which could cause issues in the calculations for the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `b` variable with the sine of `b`, which could cause issues in the calculations for the complex number.

DONE.
