 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `.apply` allows passing an array as the second argument for the function's arguments, while `.call` expects individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind` creates a new function with the provided context and arguments, while `.call` invokes the function with the provided context and arguments directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback.constructor('return this')()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function using the callback's constructor and invokes it, which is not equivalent to the original `.call` method.

DONE.
