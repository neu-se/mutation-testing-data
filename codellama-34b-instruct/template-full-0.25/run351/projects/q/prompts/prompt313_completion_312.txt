  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise that is resolved with the value of `deferred.resolve`, while `this.then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the callback function passed to `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the value of `deferred.reject`, while `this.then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the callback function passed to `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the value of `deferred.notify`, while `this.then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the
