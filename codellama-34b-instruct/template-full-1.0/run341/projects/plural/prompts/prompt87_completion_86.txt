  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'human'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'human' is not a word that can be pluralized using the existing rules in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insect'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'insect' is not a word that can be pluralized using the existing rules in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'sadness'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'sadness' is not a word that can be pluralized using the existing rules in the code.

DONE.
