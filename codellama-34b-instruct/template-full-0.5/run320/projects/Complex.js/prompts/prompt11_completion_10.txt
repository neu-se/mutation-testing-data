  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function has a different range of values than the `exp` function, and would produce different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function has a different range of values than the `exp` function, and would produce different results for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function has a different range of values than the `exp` function, and would produce different results for the same input.

DONE.
