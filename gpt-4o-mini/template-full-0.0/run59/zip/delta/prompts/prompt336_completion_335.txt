Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string' && op.retain !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a non-empty string instead of checking if it is an object, which would cause the code to skip the handling of retain operations that are actually objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is null or undefined, which would incorrectly allow the code to proceed with the assumption that `op.retain` is not an object, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is an object and simultaneously checks if it is null, which is logically impossible and would always evaluate to false, causing the code block to be skipped entirely.

DONE.
