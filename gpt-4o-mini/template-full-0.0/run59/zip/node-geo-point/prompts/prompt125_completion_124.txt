Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.latitude + this.longitude;
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly sums the latitude and longitude instead of calculating the distance between two geographical points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.abs(this.latitude - point.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calculates the absolute difference in latitude, ignoring the longitude and not providing a true distance measurement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Euclidean distance formula instead of the correct geographical distance calculation, which does not account for the curvature of the Earth.

DONE.
