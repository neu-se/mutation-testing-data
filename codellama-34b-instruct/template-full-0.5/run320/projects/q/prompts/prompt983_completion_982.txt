  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called on the `deferred.reject` object, which is not a function and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called on the `deferred.resolve` object, which is not a function and would cause an error.

DONE.
