  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` is incremented by 1, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` is used instead of the `utcOffset`, which would change the resulting offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` is multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting offset string.

DONE.
