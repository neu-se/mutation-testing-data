  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin` method to calculate the sine of the complex number, but this replacement code fragment would calculate the ratio of the real part of the complex number to the real part of the complex number, which would not have the same effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin` method to calculate the sine of the complex number, but this replacement code fragment would calculate the ratio of the imaginary part of the complex number to the real part of the complex number, which would not have the same effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin` method to calculate the sine of the complex number, but this replacement code fragment would calculate the ratio of the real part of the complex number
