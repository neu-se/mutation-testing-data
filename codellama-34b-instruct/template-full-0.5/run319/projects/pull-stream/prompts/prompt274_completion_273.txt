  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
never
```
This would result in different behavior because `never` is a function that returns a stream that never ends, whereas `once` is a function that returns a stream that ends after the first chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
twice
```
This would result in different behavior because `twice` is a function that returns a stream that ends after the second chunk, whereas `once` is a function that ends after the first chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thrice
```
This would result in different behavior because `thrice` is a function that returns a stream that ends after the third chunk, whereas `once` is a function that ends after the first chunk.

DONE.
