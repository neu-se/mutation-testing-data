Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the `inspect` variable to be considered defined if it is explicitly set to `null`, which would bypass the intended logic of initializing `inspect` to a default function when it is truly undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if `inspect` is strictly equal to `true`, which is not a valid condition for determining if `inspect` is defined, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect = function () { return {state: "fulfilled"}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally set `inspect` to a function that always returns a fulfilled state, regardless of the actual state of the promise, which could mislead consumers of the promise about its true status.

DONE.
