  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.bind(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `resolvedPromise`, which may not be the same as the `this` value in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` sets the `this` value to `null`, which may not be the same as the `this` value in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` sets the `this` value to `undefined`, which may not be the same as the `this` value in the original code.

DONE.
