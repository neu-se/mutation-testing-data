  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would not be called with the expected `error` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would not be called with the expected `error` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the string "error" instead of the expected `error` argument.

DONE.
