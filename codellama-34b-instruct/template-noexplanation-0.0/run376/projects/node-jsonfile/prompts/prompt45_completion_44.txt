  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to use a different encoding than the one specified in the `options` object, which may result in a different string being written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to use a different reviver function than the one specified in the `options` object, which may result in a different JSON object being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.replacer
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to use a different replacer function than the one specified in the `options` object, which may result in a different JSON object being written to the file.

DONE.
