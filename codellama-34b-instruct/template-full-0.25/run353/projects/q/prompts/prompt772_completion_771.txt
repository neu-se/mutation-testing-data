  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would return a promise for an array of promises, but the last promise in the array would be ignored, as the `allResolved` function only considers the first `promises.length - 1` promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would return a promise for an array of promises, but the first promise in the array would be ignored, as the `allResolved` function only considers the last `promises.length + 1` promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function would return a promise for an array of promises, but the middle promise in the array would be ignored, as the `allResolved` function
