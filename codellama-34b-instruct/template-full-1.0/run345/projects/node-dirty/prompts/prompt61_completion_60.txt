  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would cause the read stream to end immediately, whereas `destroy()` would only mark the stream as destroyed but not actually end it until all pending data was flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pause()` would only temporarily stop the stream, whereas `end()` would permanently end the stream and prevent it from being used again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.once('close', () => this._writeStream.end())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to end only once the read stream is closed, whereas the original code would cause the write stream to end immediately after the read stream is destroyed.

DONE.
