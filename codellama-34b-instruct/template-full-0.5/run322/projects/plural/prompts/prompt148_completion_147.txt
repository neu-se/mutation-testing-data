  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` does not include the `'s'` suffix, which is added in the replacement code fragment. This would cause the test to fail if the input word ends with `'s'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` does not modify the case of the input word, while the replacement code fragment `word.toUpperCase()` converts the input word to uppercase. This would cause the test to fail if the input word is not already in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` does not modify the order of the characters in the input word, while the replacement code fragment `word.split('').reverse().join('')` reverses the order of the characters
