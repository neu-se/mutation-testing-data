  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value !== value` always returns `false`, which would cause the promise to be returned directly, even if it is a rejected promise. This would cause the promise to be treated as resolution instead of rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value == value` always returns `true`, which would cause the promise to be treated as resolution instead of rejection. This would cause the promise to be returned directly, regardless of whether it is resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value === value` always returns `true`, which would cause the promise to be treated as resolution instead of rejection. This would cause the promise to be returned directly, regardless of whether it is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
