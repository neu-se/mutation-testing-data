  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next` is a function that returns the next element in the iterator, while `this.next()` calls the function and returns the result of the function, which is not necessarily the same as the next element in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next.call(this)` calls the `next` function with `this` as the `this` context, which may have different behavior than calling `next` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next.bind(this)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.next.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to `this` context, and calling that function with `()` would call the bound function, which may have different behavior than calling `next` directly.

DONE.
