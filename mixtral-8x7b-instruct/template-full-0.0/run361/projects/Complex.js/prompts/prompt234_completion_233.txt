 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now strict, excluding the case where `a` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a) < 0.00001
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if `a` is very close to zero instead of checking if it's less than or equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a < Number.EPSILON
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if `a` is less than the smallest positive number that JavaScript can represent, instead of checking if it's less than or equal to zero.

DONE.
