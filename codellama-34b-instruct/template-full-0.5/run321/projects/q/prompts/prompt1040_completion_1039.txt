  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is not linked to the original deferred object, which could cause issues with the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is not linked to the original deferred object, and it would also add an additional `then` method to the promise chain, which could cause issues with the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is not linked to the original deferred object, and it would also add an additional `catch` method to the promise chain, which could cause issues with the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
