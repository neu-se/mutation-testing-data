  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of the two arguments. Replacing the code fragment with `a, b` would cause the function to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Math.atan2` function, which takes two arguments and returns the arctangent of the quotient of the two arguments. Replacing the code fragment with `b, a` would cause the function to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b, a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
