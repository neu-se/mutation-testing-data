  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] || {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object instead of `undefined` when the key is not found in the `tzs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] && tzs[key].deprecated }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the `deprecated` property of the `tzs` object instead of the entire object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [key]: tzs[key] ? tzs[key] : {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty object instead of `undefined` when the key is not found in the `tzs` object.

DONE.
