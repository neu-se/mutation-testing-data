  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the angle of the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the angle of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the angle of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of the angle of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(this['re'] * this['re'] + this['im'] * this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the angle of the magnitude of the complex number instead of the angle of the complex number.

DONE.
