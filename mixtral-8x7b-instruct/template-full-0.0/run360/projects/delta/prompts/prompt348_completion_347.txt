 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return an incomplete `Delta` object, as the `handler.invert` function would not receive the required arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[opData, baseOpData]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a `Delta` object with an incorrectly inverted operation. Instead of updating the `inverted` object with the inverted attributes, it would push a new array containing `opData` and `baseOpData` as a single operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
opData, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a `Delta` object with incomplete attributes for the inverted operation. The `inverted` object would have missing attributes for the operation that was inverted, leading to incorrect behavior.
