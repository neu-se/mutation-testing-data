  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, but the replaced code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, which could lead to different results in certain cases.

DONE.
