  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the output of the `plural` function for the word "cellos" to "cello" instead of "cellos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the output of the `plural` function for the word "cellos" to "celloss" instead of "cellos".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof 'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the output of the `plural` function for the word "cellos" to "string" instead of "cellos".

DONE.
