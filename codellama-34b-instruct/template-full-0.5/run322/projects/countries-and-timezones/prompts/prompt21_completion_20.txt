  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tz.d
```
This would result in different behavior because `!tz.d` is always truthy, while `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.d !== 0` checks if `tz.d` is not equal to zero, while `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tz.d === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof tz.d === "number"` checks if `tz.d` is a number, while `Number.isInteger` checks if a value is an integer.

DONE.
