  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because in JavaScript, `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a particular class, while `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, if `s` is an instance of a class that inherits from `Object`, `s instanceof Object` would return `true`, while `typeof s === 'object'` would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s != null && typeof s === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because in JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are not instances of `Object`, so `s != null && typeof s === 'object'` would return `false` if `s` is `null` or `undefined`, while `s instanceof Object` would return `false` if `s` is any type of object (including `null` and `undefined`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Object
```
