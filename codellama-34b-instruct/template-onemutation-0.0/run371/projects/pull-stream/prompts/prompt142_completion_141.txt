  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `generate` function with no arguments, while the mutated code fragment calls it with an argument of `1`. This could potentially cause the `generate` function to return a different value, which could in turn cause the `infinite` function to return a different value.

DONE.
