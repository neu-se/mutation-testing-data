  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the `PLACEHOLDER` with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 && b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the double equals `==` operator is used instead of the triple equals `===` operator. This means that the comparison will be done based on value equivalence instead of reference equivalence, which could cause the test to pass even if the code has a bug.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is changed from 0 to 1. This could cause the test to fail even if the code is correct, because the expected result for `b` is now 1 instead of 0.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && !b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!`
