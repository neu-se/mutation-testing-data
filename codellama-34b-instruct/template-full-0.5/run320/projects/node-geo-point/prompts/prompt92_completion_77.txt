  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cos` to calculate the bearing, but replacing it with `sin` would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2` to calculate the bearing, but replacing it with `acos` would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2` to calculate the bearing, but replacing it with `asin` would result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
