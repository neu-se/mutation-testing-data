  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `arguments, 1` which would skip the first argument and return the second argument, while the new code would return the second and third arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments), 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `arguments` which would return the entire arguments object, while the new code would return a slice of the arguments object starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `arguments, 1` which would return the second argument, while the new code would return the first argument.

DONE.
