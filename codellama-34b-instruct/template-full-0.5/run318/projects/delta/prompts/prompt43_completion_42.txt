  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the length of the string was equal to 0, but replacing it with 1 would cause the check to always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the length of the string was equal to 0, but replacing it with -1 would cause the check to always pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the length of the string was equal to 0, but replacing it with a non-empty string would cause the check to always fail.

DONE.
