  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `array` to `fulfilled.apply()`, instead of passing the entire `array`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all elements of the `array` except the first one to `fulfilled.apply()`, instead of passing the entire `array`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` to `fulfilled.apply()`, instead of passing the `array`.

DONE.
