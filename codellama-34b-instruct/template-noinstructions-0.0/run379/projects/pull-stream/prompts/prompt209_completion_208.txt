  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `null`, which is falsy. This means that the `map` function would never be called with the new code fragment, even if the `aborted` variable is set to a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `undefined`, which is falsy. This means that the `map` function would never be called with the new code fragment, even if the `aborted` variable is set to a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
