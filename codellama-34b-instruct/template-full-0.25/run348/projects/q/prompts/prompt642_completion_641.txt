  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `args` with an argument of `1`, which would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat([1])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is called on `args` with an argument of `[1]`, which would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by the value `1`. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.filter(function(x) { return x !== 1; })]
```
