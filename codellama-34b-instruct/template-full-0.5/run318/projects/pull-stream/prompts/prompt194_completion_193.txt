  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes two arguments, while `cb` is a function that takes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a variable that is set to `true` when the `abort` function is called, while `cb` is a function that is called with a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value, while `cb` is a function that is called with a single argument.

DONE.
