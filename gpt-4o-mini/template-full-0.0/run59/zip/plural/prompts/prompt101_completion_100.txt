Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly match the word "man" and return "man" instead of the expected "men", as it does not change the 'a' to 'e'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/man/, 'woman'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace "man" with "woman", which is not the intended pluralization and would lead to incorrect results for words like "man".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/man/, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly append 's' to "man", resulting in "mans" instead of the correct plural "men".

DONE.
