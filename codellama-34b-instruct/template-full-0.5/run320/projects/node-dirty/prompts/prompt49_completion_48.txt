  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the current value of the key, rather than the value of the key at the time the `update` method was called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this._data.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the value of the key in the `_data` map, rather than the value of the key at the time the `update` method was called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key), this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `updater` function with the current value of the key, as well as the value of the key at the time the `update` method was called.

DONE.
