 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of using the `parsedBaseUrl` variable. The `URL.parse()` function would not receive the expected base URL, potentially causing incorrect URL resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object with an empty string, instead of using the `parsedBaseUrl` variable. This would cause incorrect URL resolution, as the base URL would be set to an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `currentUrlStr` instead of `parsedBaseUrl`. This could lead to incorrect URL resolution, as the base URL might not be the expected one, depending on the value of `currentUrlStr`.

DONE.
