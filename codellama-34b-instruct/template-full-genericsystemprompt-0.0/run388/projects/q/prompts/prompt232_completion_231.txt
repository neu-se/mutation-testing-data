  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second operand instead of the first to the progress listener.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first operand instead of the second to the progress listener.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second operand plus one to the progress listener.

DONE.
