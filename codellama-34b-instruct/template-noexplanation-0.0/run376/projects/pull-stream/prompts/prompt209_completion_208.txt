  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This code fragment will negate the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `aborted` is `true`. This will result in the `cb(aborted)` call being skipped, and the `abortCb` variable being set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && !busy
```
This code fragment will check if `aborted` is `true` and `busy` is `false`. If both conditions are met, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true`, and the `cb(aborted)` call will be made.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || busy
```
This code fragment will check if `aborted` is `true` or `busy` is `true`. If either condition is met, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true`, and the `cb(aborted)` call will
