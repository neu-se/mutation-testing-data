Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the data to a string before parsing, which could lead to a `SyntaxError` if the data is not a valid JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it coerces the data into a string using concatenation, which may not produce a valid JSON format, potentially causing a parsing error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the first element of the data, which could lead to an error if `data` is not an array or if it is `undefined`, resulting in a `TypeError` during parsing.

DONE.
