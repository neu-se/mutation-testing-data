Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crises/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "crisis" to "crises" but does not account for "thesis," which should also be pluralized to "theses."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|theses/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds "theses" as a match, which would cause the pluralization to incorrectly return "theses" for the singular "thesis," instead of the expected "theses."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a redundant match for "thesis," which could lead to unexpected behavior in the pluralization logic, potentially causing it to return "thesis" instead of the correct plural form "theses."

DONE.
