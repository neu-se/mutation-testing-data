  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs` is an object and `this.verbs.keys()` would return an array of the keys in the object, whereas `this.verbs` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs` is an object and `this.verbs.values()` would return an array of the values in the object, whereas `this.verbs` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs` is an object and `this.verbs.entries()` would return an array of the key-value pairs in the object, whereas `this.verbs` would return the object itself.

DONE.
