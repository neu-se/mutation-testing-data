```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `addRule('chilli', 'chillies')`, which is the correct plural form of the word "chilli".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('chilli', 'chillies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `addRule('chilli', 'chillis')`, which is the incorrect plural form of the word "chilli".
