  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 'dwarf' or 'roof', while the new code checks for inequality with both.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof' || w === 'house'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for equality with 'dwarf' or 'roof', while the new code also checks for equality with 'house'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof' && w !== 'house'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 'dwarf' or 'roof', while the new code checks for inequality with all three.

DONE.
