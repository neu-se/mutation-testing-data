 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root by using the absolute value instead of the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root by using the exponential function and multiplying by 0.5 instead of directly calculating the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root by taking the reciprocal of the square root instead of directly calculating the square root.

DONE.
