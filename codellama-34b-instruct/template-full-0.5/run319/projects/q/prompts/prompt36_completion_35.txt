  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeJS
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `isNodeJS`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `isNodeJS` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isBrowser
```
This would result in different behavior because `isBrowser` is not a variable in the code snippet, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `isNodeJS`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.env.NODE_ENV` is not a variable in the code snippet, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `isNodeJS`.

DONE.
