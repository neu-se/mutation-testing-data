  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a new promise that is rejected with the given reason, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have a `reject` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([promise])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a new promise that resolves when all of the promises in the given array have resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and does not have an `all` method.

DONE.
