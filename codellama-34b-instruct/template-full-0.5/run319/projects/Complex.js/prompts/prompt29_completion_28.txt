  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the value of `a` and potentially cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `b` would change the value of `a` and potentially cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `b` would change the value of `a` and potentially cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
