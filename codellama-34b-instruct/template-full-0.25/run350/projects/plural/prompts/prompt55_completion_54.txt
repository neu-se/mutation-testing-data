  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression as the first argument, which replaces the first occurrence of the regular expression in the string with the second argument. However, the new code fragment uses the `replace` method with a string as the first argument, which replaces all occurrences of the string in the string with the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression as the first argument, which replaces the first occurrence of the regular expression in the string with the second argument.
