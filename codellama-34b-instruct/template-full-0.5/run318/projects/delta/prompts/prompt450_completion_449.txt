  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' &&
        (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `typeof op.retain === 'number' && (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null)`, which is different from the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would only check if `op.retain` is an object and not null, without checking if it's a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'number' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would only check if `op.retain`
