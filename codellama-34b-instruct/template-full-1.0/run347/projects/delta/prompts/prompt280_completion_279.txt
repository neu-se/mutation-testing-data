  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.retain(length());
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` takes a value for the number of characters to retain, but `length` returns a numeric value representing the length of the delta, which is not necessarily the same as the number of characters to retain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.retain(length, {}');
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `retain` is an object representing the attributes to apply to the retained text, but `{}` is an empty object and therefore does not apply any attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.retain(length, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `retain` can also be set to `null` to indicate that no attributes should be applied to the retained text.

DONE.
