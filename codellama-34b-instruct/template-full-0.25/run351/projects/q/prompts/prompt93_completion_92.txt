  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would evaluate to `true` in a boolean context, while `1 + 1` would evaluate to `2`, which would evaluate to `true` in a boolean context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would evaluate to `true` in a boolean context, while `"hello"` would evaluate to `false` in a boolean context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which would evaluate to `true` in a boolean context, while `[]` would evaluate to `false` in a boolean context.

DONE.
