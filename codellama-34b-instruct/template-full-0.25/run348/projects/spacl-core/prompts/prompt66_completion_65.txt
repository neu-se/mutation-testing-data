  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null` instead of checking the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always check the first rule in the array instead of checking all the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.rules.length)];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would check a random rule from the array instead of checking all the rules.

DONE.
