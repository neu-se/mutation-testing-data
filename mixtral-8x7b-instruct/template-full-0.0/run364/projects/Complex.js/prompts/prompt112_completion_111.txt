 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a real number, ignoring the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random value for the imaginary part, making the result unpredictable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would duplicate the real part instead of returning the imaginary part, causing incorrect results.

DONE.
