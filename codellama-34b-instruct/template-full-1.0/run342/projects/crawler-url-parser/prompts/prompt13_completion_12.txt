  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```replace(/#/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all anchors from the URL, while the original code only removes the first one.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```replace('//', 'https://');
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol of the URL from `http` to `https`, which could cause the code to throw an error if the URL is not properly formatted.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```replace(/\W+/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes all non-word characters from the URL, including the `/` character, which could cause the code to throw an error if the URL is not properly formatted.

DONE.
