  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a new deferred object, which is not the same as the original `deferred` object that was created earlier in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a null value, which is not the same as the original `deferred` object that was created earlier in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(undefined)` creates a new deferred object with an undefined value, which is not the same as the original `deferred` object that was created earlier in the code.

DONE.
