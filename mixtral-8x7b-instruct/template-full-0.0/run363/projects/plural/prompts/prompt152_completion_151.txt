 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 's' as the plural suffix, regardless of the value of `num`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the value of `num` before checking if it's 1, which could lead to incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(num)
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the value of `num` down to the nearest integer before checking if it's 1, which could lead to incorrect pluralization for decimal values.

DONE.
