  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `timezonesMap` object, regardless of whether it has been initialized or not. In the original code, the `timezonesMap` object is only initialized if it is `undefined`, which means that it will only be initialized once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object if `timezonesMap` is `undefined`, which means that the `buildTimezonesMap` function would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap || buildTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `buildTimezonesMap` function if `timezonesMap` is `undefined`, which means that the function would be called multiple times.

DONE.
