  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and adding the string "bug" to it would result in a new string that is different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would result in a new string that is different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, and replacing it with `null` would result in a different value.

DONE.
