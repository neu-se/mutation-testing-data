  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the second element of the `rules` array, rather than the first element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the length of the `rules` array, rather than the first element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a random element from the `rules` array, rather than the first element as intended.

DONE.
