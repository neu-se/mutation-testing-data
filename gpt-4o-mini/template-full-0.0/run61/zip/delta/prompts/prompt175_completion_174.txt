Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic from retrieving the length of the current operation to retrieving its type, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations based on their type rather than their length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it switches the context from the current iterator (`thisIter`) to the other iterator (`otherIter`), potentially leading to incorrect length calculations and mismatched operations during the composition of deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it ensures that the length is always non-negative, which could mask issues where the length should be zero or negative, leading to incorrect processing of operations that rely on the actual length value.

DONE.
