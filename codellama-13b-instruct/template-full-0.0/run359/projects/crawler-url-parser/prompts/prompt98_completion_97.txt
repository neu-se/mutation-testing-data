  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `has` method returns `true` if the key is in the map, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the `has` method is used to check if the `urlMap` already contains the `currentUrl.url` key, and if it does, the `tmpUrl` object is updated with the new `text` value. In the buggy code, the `has` method is used to check if the `urlMap` already contains the `currentUrl.url` key, and if it does not, the `tmpUrl` object is created with the `currentUrl.url` key and the `text` value. This would result in different behavior because the buggy code would create a new `tmpUrl` object for each unique `currentUrl.url` key, whereas the original code would only update the existing `tmpUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.
