  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, undefined
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which may also cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
