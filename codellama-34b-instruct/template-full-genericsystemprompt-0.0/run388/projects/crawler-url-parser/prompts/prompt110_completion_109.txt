  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete` only removes the element with the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds a new element to the map with the specified key and value, while `delete` only removes the element with the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` removes the element with the specified key from the map, while `set()` adds a new element to the map with the specified key and value.

DONE.
