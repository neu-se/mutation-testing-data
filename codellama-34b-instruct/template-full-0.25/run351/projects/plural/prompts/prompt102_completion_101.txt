  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the function passed as the second argument is also different. The original code fragment uses a case-insensitive regular expression pattern that matches words that end with "s" or "es", while the new code fragment uses a case-insensitive regular expression pattern that matches words that start with "bison", "cod", "deer", "fowl", "halibut", "moose", or "sheep". Additionally, the function passed as the second argument in the new code fragment always returns the input word with an "s" appended to it, while the function passed as the second argument in the original code fragment returns the input word with "es" appended to it if the input word ends with "s", and with "s" appended to it if the input word does not end
