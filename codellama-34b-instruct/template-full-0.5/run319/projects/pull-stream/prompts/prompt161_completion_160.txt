  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` if `value` is not null, while the replaced code fragment calls `cb` regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original value of `_value` to the `cb` function, while the replaced code fragment passes a modified version of `_value` to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the original value of `_value` to the `cb` function, while the replaced code fragment passes a modified version of `_value` to the `cb` function.

DONE.
