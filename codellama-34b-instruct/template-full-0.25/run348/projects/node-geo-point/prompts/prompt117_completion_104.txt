  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of a `GeoPoint` object, which could cause errors in the code that uses the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude values of 0, which could cause errors in the code that uses the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.fromLatLngArray([0, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude values of 0, which could cause errors in the code that uses the function.

DONE.
