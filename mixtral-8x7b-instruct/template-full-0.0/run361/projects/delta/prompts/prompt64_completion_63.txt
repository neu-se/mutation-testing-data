 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the newOp at the beginning of the ops array instead of preserving the original order and position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops = [...this.ops, newOp];
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the newOp appended, instead of modifying the existing array in-place. This could lead to issues if other parts of the codebase rely on the original array's identity or reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.ops.concat(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new array with the newOp concatenated, but does not modify the original `ops` array. This could lead to inconsistencies if the code expects the `ops` array to be modified in-place.
