  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `embedBaseUrlStr` string to lowercase, which could affect the comparison with the `baseUrlStr` string in the `parse()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `embedBaseUrlStr` string to uppercase, which could affect the comparison with the `baseUrlStr` string in the `parse()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http` or `https` protocol from the `embedBaseUrlStr` string, which could affect the comparison with the `baseUrlStr` string in the `parse()` function.
