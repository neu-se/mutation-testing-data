  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the exception itself, rather than the value of the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.

DONE.
