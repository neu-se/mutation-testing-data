  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to always be considered an object, even if it is null. This could lead to incorrect data being returned by the `peekType` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the `retain` property to always be null, even if it is not null. This could lead to incorrect data being returned by the `peekType` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.retain.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `retain` property to be a number if it has a length greater than 1. This could lead to incorrect data being returned by the `peekType` function.

DONE.
