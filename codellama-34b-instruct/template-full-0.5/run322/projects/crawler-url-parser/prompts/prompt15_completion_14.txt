  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with a "#" character, while the new code fragment matches any string that ends with a "#" character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains a "#" character, while the new code fragment matches any string that ends with a "#" character and has the "g" flag, which makes the match global.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that contains a "#" character, while the new code fragment matches any string that ends with a "#" character and has the "i" flag, which makes the match case-insensitive.

DONE.
