  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined on the `baseOp` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined on the `baseOp` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not defined on the `baseOp` object, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError` at runtime.

DONE.
