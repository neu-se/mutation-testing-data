  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the value `value`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the value `value`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(reject(value))` would resolve the promise with the rejected promise `reject(value)`, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the value `value`.

DONE.
