 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always be true, regardless of the value of `this['im']`, which could lead to incorrect results or errors in the 'mul' method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a condition that is not present in the original code, potentially causing incorrect results or errors in the 'mul' method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method being called, potentially causing errors or incorrect results in the 'mul' method, depending on the implementation of `this['isInfinite']()`.

DONE.
