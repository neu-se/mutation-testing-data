  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while the mutated code fragment checks if `value` is equal to `null`. If `value` is `null`, the original code fragment would return `true`, while the mutated code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while the mutated code fragment checks if `value` is identical to `null`. If `value` is `null`, the original code fragment would return `true`, while the mutated code fragment would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while the mutated code fragment checks if `value` is not identical
