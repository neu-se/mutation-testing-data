Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'', ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the '$' character, potentially leading to incorrect replacements in the target path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$', '$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only escape the '$' character once, potentially leading to incorrect replacements in the target path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$', 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all '$' characters with 'abc', potentially leading to incorrect replacements in the target path.

DONE.
