  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sum of the real parts of the two complex numbers, while this code fragment calculates the sum of the real parts and the imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the product of the real parts of the two complex numbers, while this code fragment calculates the product of the real parts and the imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the difference of the real parts of the two complex numbers, while this code fragment calculates the difference of the real parts and the imaginary parts.

DONE.
