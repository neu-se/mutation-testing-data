Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `linkurl_path` begins with `pageurl_path`, which is a stricter condition than checking if `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path` anywhere within it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `endsWith` checks if `linkurl_path` ends with `pageurl_path`, which does not account for the presence of `pageurl_path` in the middle of `linkurl_path`, thus changing the logic of the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because using the strict equality operator `===` checks if both paths are exactly the same, which is a much more restrictive condition than checking for inclusion, potentially leading to different outcomes in the logic flow.

DONE.
