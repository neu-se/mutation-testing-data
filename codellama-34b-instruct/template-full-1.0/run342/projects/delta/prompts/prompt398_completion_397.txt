  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is not a valid property of an Op object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is not a valid property of an Op object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.length` is not a valid property of an Op object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
