 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a Complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of -Infinity when d === 0, instead of considering the signs of a and b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a Complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of -1 when d === 0, instead of considering the signs of a and b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a Complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0 when d === 0, instead of considering the signs of a and b.

DONE.
