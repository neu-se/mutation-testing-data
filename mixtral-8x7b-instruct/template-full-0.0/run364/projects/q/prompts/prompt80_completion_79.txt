 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` callback would be executed after a delay of 1 millisecond instead of immediately (with a delay of 0 milliseconds). This could lead to race conditions or other timing-related issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` expects a function as its first argument, and `null` is not a function. This would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { /* do nothing */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` callback would not throw an exception even if one is caught in the `runSingle` function. Instead, it would execute the "do nothing" function, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly if the exception is meant to indicate a failure condition.

DONE.
