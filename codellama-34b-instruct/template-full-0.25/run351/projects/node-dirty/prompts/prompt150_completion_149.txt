  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with the error object as an argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with the error object as an argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with a null argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with the error object as an argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with a new Error object.

DONE.
