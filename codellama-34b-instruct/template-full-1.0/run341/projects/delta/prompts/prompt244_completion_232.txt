  Option 1:
Million dollar mistake, mocking a bug fix with a different bug.
Option 2:
Fix the catastrophic bug by using obtuse magic.
Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0);
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the iterator would repeatedly return the same operation, causing the `delete` method to be called with a length of 0 indefinitely.

DONE.
