  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would increment `index` before the comparison, whereas in the original code it was incremented after the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `index` before the comparison, whereas in the original code it was incremented after the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `index` before the comparison, whereas in the original code it was incremented after the comparison.

DONE.
