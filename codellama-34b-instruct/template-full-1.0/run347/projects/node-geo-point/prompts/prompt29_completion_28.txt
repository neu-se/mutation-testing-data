  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because longitude and latitude are different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because point1 and point2 are different variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the trigonometric function would introduce a new operation.

DONE.
