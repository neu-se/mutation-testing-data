  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the high compression level, regardless of the user's input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the medium compression level, regardless of the user's input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the low compression level, regardless of the user's input.

DONE.
