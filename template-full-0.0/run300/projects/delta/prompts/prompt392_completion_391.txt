  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return an empty op instead of an op with a length of `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return an op with a length of `length + 1` instead of `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would return an op with a length of `length - 1` instead of `length`.

DONE.
