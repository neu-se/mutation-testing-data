  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the parent context to the `query` method, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.child
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the child context to the `query` method, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx.sibling
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the sibling context to the `query` method, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
