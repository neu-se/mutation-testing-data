  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `a[key]` is compared to `b[key]`, while `0` would always be considered less than `b[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `a[key]` is compared to `b[key]`, while `null` would always be considered less than `b[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `a[key]` is compared to `b[key]`, while `a[key + 1]` would compare `b[key + 1]` to `b[key]`.

DONE.
