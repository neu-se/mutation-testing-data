  Sure, here are three possible mutations of the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("PLACEHOLDER: defer"));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` will always reject the promise, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause an error when trying to invoke it as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a function and will cause an error when trying to invoke it as a function.

DONE.
