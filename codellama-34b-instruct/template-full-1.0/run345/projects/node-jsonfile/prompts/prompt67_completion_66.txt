  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a space after the placeholder, which would change the output of the `stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'' + 'x'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the letter "x" after the placeholder, which would change the output of the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'; '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a different separator after the placeholder, which would change the output of the `stringify` function.

DONE.
