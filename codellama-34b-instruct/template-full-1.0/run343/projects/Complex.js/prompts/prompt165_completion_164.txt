  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would flip the result of `this['isInfinite']`, potentially causing the `return Complex['INFINITY'];` statement to be reached in cases where it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses after `isInfinite` would force a function call, rather than returning the function itself. This would cause a type error because `this['isInfinite']` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isnan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isnan']` would be a different function than `this['isInfinite']`, potentially causing the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
