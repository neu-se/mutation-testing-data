  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the `i`th element of the array is greater than or equal to the `j`th element of the array, while the new fragment returns `false` in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++] > array[j++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compares the `i`th element of the array with the `j`th element of the array, while the new fragment compares the `i`th element of the array with the `j`th element of the array, and also increments `i` and `j`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i - 1] > array[j - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compares the `i`th element of the array with the `j`th element of the array
