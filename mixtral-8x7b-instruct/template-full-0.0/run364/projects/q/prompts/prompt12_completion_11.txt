 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok()` check would always return false, and the `Q` object would not be initialized as a global in non-windowed contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof ses === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ses` is a function instead of checking if it is defined. This would cause the `Q` object to not be initialized as a global in non-windowed contexts even if `ses` is defined but not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `ses` is undefined, which is the opposite of the original condition. This would cause the `Q` object to always be initialized as a global in non-windowed contexts, even if `ses` is defined.
