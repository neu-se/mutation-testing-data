  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value will be replaced with an `undefined` value, which may cause errors in the function when it is used as a parameter in the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value will be replaced with the `null` value, which may cause errors in the function when it is used as a parameter in the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value will be replaced with an empty string, which may cause errors in the function when it is used as a parameter in the `cb` function.

DONE.
