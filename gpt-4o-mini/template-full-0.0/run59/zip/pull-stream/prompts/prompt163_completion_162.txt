Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the array is empty instead of checking if the array is falsy. If the array is defined but empty, the function would still proceed to the next part of the code, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality to check for both `null` and `undefined`, which may allow for other falsy values (like `0` or `''`) to pass through, leading to incorrect handling of valid arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `array` is a string instead of checking if it is falsy. If a string is passed, the function would incorrectly treat it as an array, leading to potential runtime errors when trying to access its length or iterate over it.

DONE.
