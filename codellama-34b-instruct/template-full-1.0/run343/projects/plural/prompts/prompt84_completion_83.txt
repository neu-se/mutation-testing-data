  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not match the regex pattern of adding an 's' to the end of a word in the plural form, which is what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'house'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an 'es' to the end of the word instead of an 's', which is not consistent with the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an 'es' to the end of the word instead of an 's', which is not consistent with the rest of the function.

DONE.
