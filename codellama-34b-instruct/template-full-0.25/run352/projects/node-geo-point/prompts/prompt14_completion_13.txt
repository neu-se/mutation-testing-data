  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression, so if `Array.isArray` returns `true`, the inverted result would be `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of the expression, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` or `false` when it should have been the other way around.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 0` operation would always result in `0`, regardless of the original value of the expression, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should have been `true`.

DONE.
