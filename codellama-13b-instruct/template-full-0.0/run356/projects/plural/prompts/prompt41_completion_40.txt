  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a shallow copy of the specified portion of the string, whereas the `substr` method returns a substring of the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a substring of the specified length, whereas the `substr` method returns a substring of the specified length, but also allows for negative values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method is used to extract the substring of the word, and then the `ices` string is concatenated to the end of the substring. This would result in a different plural form for words that end with `x` or `ch`.

DONE.
