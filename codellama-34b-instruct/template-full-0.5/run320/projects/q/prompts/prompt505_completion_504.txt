  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the function call, whereas `null` would be used in the mutated code. This could potentially change the behavior of the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the function call, whereas `this` would be used in the mutated code. This could potentially change the behavior of the function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `thisp` is used as the `this` value for the function call, whereas `undefined` would be used in the mutated code. This could potentially change the behavior of the function being called.

DONE.
