  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `values` is a function that returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, but also includes the values of any inherited properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).map(key => object[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `map()` is a function that applies a function to each element of an array and returns a new array with the results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable
