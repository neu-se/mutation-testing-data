  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this new code fragment throws an Error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 'Invalid Param';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this new code fragment throws a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw { message: 'Invalid Param' };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this new code fragment throws an object.

DONE.
