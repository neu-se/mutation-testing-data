  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
