  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second argument instead of the first, which could break the functionality of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the first, which could break the functionality of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the first argument but would end one iteration before the last, which could also break the functionality of the code.

DONE.
