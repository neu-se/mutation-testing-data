  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` argument is passed to the `cb` function instead of the `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently if the `cb` function is expecting the `end` argument to be a certain value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is passed to the `cb` function instead of the `data` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently if the `cb` function is expecting the `data` argument to be a certain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is passed to the `read` function instead of the `end` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently if the `read` function is expecting the `end` argument to be a certain value.

DONE.
