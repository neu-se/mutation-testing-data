 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would no longer call the `onEnd` callback when the `end` event is received, and the `cb` function would be called with `end` set to `true` and `data` set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would call the `onEnd` callback with the `data` value received in the current chunk, rather than passing `null` or an `end` event as the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would be called with the `data` value received in the current chunk, rather than passing `end` set to `true` or `false` to the `onEnd` callback.

DONE.
