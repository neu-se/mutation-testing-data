  Obviouly as an expert of mutation testing, i can provide you with three options that can be used to replace the placeholder in the code for the purpose of mutation testing.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because .values() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, whereas .keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.size
```
This would result in different behavior because .size() method returns the number of key-value pairs in a given object, whereas .keys() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because .entries() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property [key, value] pairs, whereas .keys() method returns an array of a given object
