  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` have different ranges and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` have different ranges and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` and `-cosh` have different ranges and values.

DONE.
