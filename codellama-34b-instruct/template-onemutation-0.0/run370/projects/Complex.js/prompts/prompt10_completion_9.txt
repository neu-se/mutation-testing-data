  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential of a given number, while the replaced code fragment uses the `Math.exp2` function, which computes the exponential of a given number in base 2. The `Math.exp2` function is not defined in the code snippet, so it would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
