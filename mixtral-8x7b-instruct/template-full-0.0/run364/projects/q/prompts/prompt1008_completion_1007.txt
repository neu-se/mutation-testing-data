 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, but skips the first argument, which is the `name` variable in this context. The original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which is an alias for `[].slice.call(arguments, 1)`, but directly replacing the `arguments` object with the above code fragment would cause the `name` variable to be lost.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to get the second key from the `arguments` object, which is not guaranteed to exist or be the correct value. The original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which is a safe way to get all arguments except for the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
