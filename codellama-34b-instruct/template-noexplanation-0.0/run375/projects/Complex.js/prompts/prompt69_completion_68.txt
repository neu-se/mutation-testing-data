  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This will cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with the value of `a`, which is a string, as its argument. This will likely cause the function to throw an error, as it is designed to throw an error when its argument is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(b);
```
This will cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with the value of `b`, which is a string, as its argument. This will likely cause the function to throw an error, as it is designed to throw an error when its argument is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a + b);
```
This will cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with the sum of `a` and `b` as its argument. This will likely cause the function to throw an error, as it is designed to throw an error when its argument
