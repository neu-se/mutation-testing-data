  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a new node resolver, while the replacement code fragment does not create a new resolver. This could result in improper handling of node callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while the replacement code fragment passes `null`. This could result in the node resolver being created with incorrect or unexpected parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, while the replacement code fragment passes `deferred`. This could result
