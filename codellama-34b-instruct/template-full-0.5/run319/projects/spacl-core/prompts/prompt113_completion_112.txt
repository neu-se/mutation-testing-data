  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any verb that is not explicitly denied by the rule to be allowed, regardless of whether it is explicitly allowed or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any verb that is explicitly allowed by the rule to be allowed, regardless of whether it is explicitly denied or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would deny any verb that is explicitly allowed by the rule, regardless of whether it is explicitly denied or not.

DONE.
