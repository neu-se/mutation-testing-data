  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deprecate` function to be called on the `value` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deprecate` function to be called on the `value` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(value, callback, alternative);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deprecate` function to be called on the `value` argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
