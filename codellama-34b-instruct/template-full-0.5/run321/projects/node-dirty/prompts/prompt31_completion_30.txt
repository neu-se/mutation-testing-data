  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the key from the database, rather than setting it to undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, null, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the key to null, rather than undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the callback function.

DONE.
