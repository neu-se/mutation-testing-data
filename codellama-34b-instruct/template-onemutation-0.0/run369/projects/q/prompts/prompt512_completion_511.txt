  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_values
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `object_keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

DONE.
