  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would be called on `distance + 1`, which is a different value than the original `distance`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would be called on `distance - 1`, which is a different value than the original `distance`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number` function would be called on `distance * 2`, which is a different value than the original `distance`.

DONE.
