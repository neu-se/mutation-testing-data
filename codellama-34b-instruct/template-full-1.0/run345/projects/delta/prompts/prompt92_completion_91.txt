  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the new operation to the end of the array, even if there are existing operations at the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the array if there are no existing operations at the end of the array, and otherwise it would push the new operation to a position after the last existing operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the beginning of the array, even if there are existing operations at the beginning of the array.

DONE.
