  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is a different property than `a['arg']`, and it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, as the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `a['arg']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, as the `* 2` would multiply the value of `a['arg']` by 2.

DONE.
