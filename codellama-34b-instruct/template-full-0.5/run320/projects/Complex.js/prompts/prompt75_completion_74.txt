  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element of the array instead of the first, potentially skipping over important elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * tokens.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random element of the array instead of the first, potentially leading to non-deterministic behavior.

DONE.
