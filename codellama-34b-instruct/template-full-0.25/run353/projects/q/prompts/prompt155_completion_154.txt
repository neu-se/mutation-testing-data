  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").reverse().join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be reversed, which could make it more difficult to understand the order of events leading to the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.replace(/\n/g, " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the stack trace would be condensed into a single line, which could make it more difficult to read and understand.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n").filter(function(line) { return line.indexOf("node_modules") === -1; }).join("\n")
```
This would result in different behavior because any lines containing the string "node_modules" would be removed from the stack trace, which could make it more difficult to understand the context of the error.

DONE.
