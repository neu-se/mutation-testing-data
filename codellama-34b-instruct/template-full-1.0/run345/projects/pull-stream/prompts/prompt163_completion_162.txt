  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (array === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array` is a required argument for the `values` function, and if it is `undefined`, the function would no longer be able to iterate over it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (array.length === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer iterate over the `array` if it has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (array.includes(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer iterate over the `array` if it includes a `null` value.

DONE.
