  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = []
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an object, while the replaced code fragment is an array. This change would likely cause the tests to fail, as the tests were likely written to expect an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an object, while the replaced code fragment is null. This change would likely cause the tests to fail, as the tests were likely written to expect an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was an object, while the replaced code fragment is an empty object. This change would likely cause the tests to fail, as the tests were likely written to expect an object with specific properties.

DONE.
