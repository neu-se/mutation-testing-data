  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"mapper"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "mapper" instead of the result of calling the mapper function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the result of adding 1 to the result of calling the mapper function, instead of just returning the result of calling the mapper function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would assume that the `mapper` function has a `test` method that returns a function, although it doesn't.

DONE.
