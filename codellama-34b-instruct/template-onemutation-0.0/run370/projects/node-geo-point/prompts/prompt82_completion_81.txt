  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude, while the new code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the latitude. This would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
