  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the first argument, regardless of the number of arguments passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the argument list, regardless of the contents of the arguments themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[arguments.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the last argument, regardless of the number of arguments passed.

DONE.
