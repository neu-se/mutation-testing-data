  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index++], index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index++` would increment the `index` variable before it is used as an index, which would result in a different value being accessed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index+1], index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index+1` would add 1 to the `index` variable before it is used as an index, which would result in a different value being accessed from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index*2], index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index*2` would multiply the `index` variable by 2 before it is used as an index, which would result in a different value being accessed from the array.

DONE.
