  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `values` function to be called on the `stream` object, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called on the `stream` object, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = stream.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to be called on the `stream` object, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
