  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with a different `this` context, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb && abortCb.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with a different set of arguments, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
