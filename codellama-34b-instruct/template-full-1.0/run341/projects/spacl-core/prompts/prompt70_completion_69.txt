  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the outcome of the expression, so if the path is truthy, it would result in `false`, and if the path is falsy, it would result in `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the path to lowercase, which could potentially result in a different set of rules being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the path, which could potentially result in a different set of rules being applied.

DONE.
