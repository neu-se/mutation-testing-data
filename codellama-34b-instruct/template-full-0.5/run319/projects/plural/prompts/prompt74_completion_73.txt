  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "die" and replace it with "dice", while this new code fragment would match the word "die" and replace it with "dies", which is not the intended plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "die" and replace it with "dice", while this new code fragment would match the word "die" and replace it with "die" + "s", which would result in the incorrect plural form "dies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word "die"
