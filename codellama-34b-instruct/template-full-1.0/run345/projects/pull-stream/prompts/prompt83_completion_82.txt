  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is expected to be a function, but by replacing it with an empty object, the loop will be infinite and the test will fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is expected to be a function, but by replacing it with an empty function, the loop will be infinite and the test will fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op = function() { return false }
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is expected to be a function that returns `true` or `false`, but by replacing it with a function that always returns `false`, the loop will be infinite and the test will fail.

DONE.
