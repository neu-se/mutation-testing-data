  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when the `spec` argument contains a colon, as the `search` method will return a non-null value for a colon, which will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf(':')
```
This will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when the `spec` argument contains a colon, as the `indexOf` method will return a non-negative value for a colon, which will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` and throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes(':')
```
This will cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when the `spec` argument contains a colon, as the `includes` method will return `true` for a colon, which will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to
