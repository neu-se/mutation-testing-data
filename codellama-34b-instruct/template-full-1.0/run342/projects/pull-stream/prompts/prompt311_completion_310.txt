  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would flip the truthiness of `data`, potentially causing the `test` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the `test` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` would return an array of strings, whereas `data` is a single string. The `test` function may be relying on the fact that `data` is a string, and changing it to an array could cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
