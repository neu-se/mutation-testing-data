  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_c
```
This would result in different behavior because `_c` is not defined. The original code assumes that `_b` is a variable that has been declared and initialized, but `_c` is not declared or initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` is not being used in the original code. The original code assumes that `_b` is a variable that has been declared and initialized, but `_a` is not being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_d
```
This would result in different behavior because `_d` is not being used in the original code. The original code assumes that `_b` is a variable that has been declared and initialized, but `_d` is not being used.

DONE.
