  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` is a function that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` is a property that refers to the length of the current operation in the iterator. Using `otherIter.peekLength()` instead of `otherIter.peekLength` would cause the code to behave differently because it would be using the length of the next operation instead of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength + 1` would cause the code to use the length of the current operation plus one, which would result in a different value than `otherIter.peekLength`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter
