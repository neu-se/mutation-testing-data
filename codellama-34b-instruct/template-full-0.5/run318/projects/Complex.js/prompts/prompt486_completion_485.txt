  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property to `false`, which would affect the behavior of the code that checks the value of this property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `__esModule` property to `false`, which would affect the behavior of the code that checks the value of this property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = !Complex['__esModule'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of the `__esModule` property between `true` and `false`, which would affect the behavior of the code that checks the value of this property.

DONE.
