  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by one more step than the original code, potentially skipping over an important operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to regress by one step than the original code, potentially missing an important operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance by twice the original step, potentially skipping over important operations or repeating the same operation twice.

DONE.
