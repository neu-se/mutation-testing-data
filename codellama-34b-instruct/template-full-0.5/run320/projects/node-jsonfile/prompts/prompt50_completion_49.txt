  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter is now a single element array, rather than an object. This would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `options.replacer` property, which is only defined for objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.encoding` property is now a string, rather than an object. This would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `options.replacer` property, which is only defined for objects.
