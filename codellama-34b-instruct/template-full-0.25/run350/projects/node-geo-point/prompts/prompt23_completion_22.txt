  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be using the wrong property name to retrieve the latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be concatenating the latitude and longitude values instead of using them separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' * 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be multiplying the latitude and longitude values instead of using them separately.

DONE.
