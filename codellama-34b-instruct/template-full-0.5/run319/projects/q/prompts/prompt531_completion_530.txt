  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"different object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would return a different object than the expected one.

DONE.
