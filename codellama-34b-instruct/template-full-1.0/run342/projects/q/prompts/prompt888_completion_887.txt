  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfcall` function to return a promise that resolves to the value `2` instead of the original value of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfcall` function to return a promise that resolves to the value `0` instead of the original value of `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nfcall` function to return a promise that resolves to the value `-1` instead of the original value of `1`.

DONE.
