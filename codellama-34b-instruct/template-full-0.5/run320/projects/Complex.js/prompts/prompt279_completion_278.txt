  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different values for the same input, which would cause the algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) + Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the algorithm would be adding an extra term to the calculation, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) + Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the algorithm would be adding an extra term to the calculation, which would change the result.

DONE.
