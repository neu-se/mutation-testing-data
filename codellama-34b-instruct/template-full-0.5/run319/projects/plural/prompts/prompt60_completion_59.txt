  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criteria'`, which is the plural form of the word. Replacing it with `'criterion'` would result in the singular form of the word, which could cause issues in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criteria'`, which is the plural form of the word. Replacing it with `'criterions'` would result in a misspelling of the word, which could cause issues in the code.
