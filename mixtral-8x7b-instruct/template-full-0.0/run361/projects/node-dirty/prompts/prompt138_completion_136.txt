 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `JSON.stringify` method, which would then treat `key` as a string literal instead of a variable reference. This could lead to incorrectly formatted data being written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.key
