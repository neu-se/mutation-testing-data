  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to always return `0` for the `peekLength()` method, effectively skipping over the remaining ops in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to always return `Infinity` for the `peekLength()` method, effectively iterating over the remaining ops in the `other` delta infinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to return a random non-integer length for the `peekLength()` method, potentially causing the iterator to skip over or repeat ops in the `other` delta.

DONE.
