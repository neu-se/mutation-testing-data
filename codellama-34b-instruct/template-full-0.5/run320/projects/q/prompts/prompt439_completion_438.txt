  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler to the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler to the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a new rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.resolve("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional `then` handler to the promise, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a new resolution value.

DONE.
