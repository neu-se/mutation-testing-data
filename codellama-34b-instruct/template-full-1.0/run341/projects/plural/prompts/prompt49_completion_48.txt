  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){
  addRule(/e/i, 'be abel to replace the n' + ' stores demo');
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function inside the parentheses would be called immediately, which would add a new rule with a regular expression that matches the letter "e" in a case-insensitive manner and replaces it with the string "be abel to replace the n' + ' stores demo" (with a newline character). This is different from the original code fragment which adds a rule with a regular expression that matches the letter "y" in a case-insensitive manner and replaces it with the string "ies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(num){
  addRule(/[0-9]$/i, 'be able to replace' + ' the n' + ' stores demo' + num);
})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function inside the parentheses would be called immediately, which would add a new rule with a regular
