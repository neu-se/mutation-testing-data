Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('hrefs');
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a non-existent attribute `hrefs`, which would return `undefined` instead of the actual `href` value, potentially causing the subsequent URL parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').toUpperCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `href` value to uppercase, which may affect the URL parsing and comparison, leading to incorrect results for URLs that are case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('data-href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access a custom data attribute `data-href` instead of the standard `href`, which would likely lead to missing or incorrect URL values during extraction.

DONE.
