  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a constant value and not a reference to a task, so it would be ignored by the `runSingle()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that indicates that a variable or property has not been set, and it would cause the `runSingle()` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"bar"` is a string and not a reference to a task, so it would be ignored by the `runSingle()` function.

DONE.
