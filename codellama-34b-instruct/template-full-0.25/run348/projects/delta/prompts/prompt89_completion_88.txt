  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` can be an object or null, and the original code only checks if it's an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` can be an object or undefined, and the original code only checks if it's an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null && newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.attributes` can be an object, null, or undefined, and the original code only checks if it's an object.

DONE.
