  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `policy` variable is defined, while the mutated code fragment sets `policy` to `null`, which would cause the `for` loop to skip over the loop body and not execute the `this.set(policy.name, policy)` statement.

DONE.
