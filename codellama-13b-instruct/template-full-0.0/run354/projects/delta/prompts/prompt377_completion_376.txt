  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType.call(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used to invoke the `peekType` method on the `otherIter` object, which would cause the method to be invoked with a different `this` binding.

DONE.
