 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of copying the properties of `newOp`. This could lead to unexpected results when processing the `newOp` later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `Delta` object, not the `newOp`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the `newOp` later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `newOp` to `null`. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior when processing the `newOp` later in the code.

DONE.
