  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the `arguments` object of the current function, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive a `null` value instead of an array-like object, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the `arguments` object of the current function, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive an `undefined` value instead of an array-like object, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
