 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return {resolve: function() {}, promise: Q.defer()}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with a `resolve` function and a new promise each time `put` is called, instead of reusing the same `ends` object. This could cause issues with synchronization and potential data loss.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{resolve: function() {}, promise: Q.defer().promise}
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an already resolved promise, which breaks the queue functionality. When trying to put a new value in the queue, it would immediately resolve the promise, causing issues with the order of elements in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{resolve: function(value) { throw new Error("Can't add value to full queue"); }, promise: Q.defer().promise}
