Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `nextStream` function to be called with a `true` argument, which would cause the `cb` callback to be invoked with `true` immediately, potentially terminating the stream prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `nextStream` would not trigger the expected behavior of reading the next stream, leading to a situation where the stream may not be processed correctly, and the callback may not be called as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `nextChunk()` instead of `nextStream()` would attempt to read from the current stream immediately, which could lead to an infinite loop if the current stream is not properly handled or if it does not yield any data.

DONE.
