  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of x, while the modified code fragment calculates the cosine of x + 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of x, while the modified code fragment calculates the cosine of x \* 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of x, while the modified code fragment calculates the cosine of x / 2.

DONE.
