 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement always checks against the integer 1, instead of using the input's properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement removes the input argument, causing an error in the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isInfinite('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement passes an empty string as an argument, which is not a valid input for the function.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting unexpected behavior caused by mutations in the code. DONE.
