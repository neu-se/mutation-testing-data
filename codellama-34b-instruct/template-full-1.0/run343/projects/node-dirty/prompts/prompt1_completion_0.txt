  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear()` method would empty the `_data` map, causing the `get()` method to return `undefined` for any key, even if the key is present in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete()` method would remove the given key-value pair from the map, causing the `get()` method to return `undefined` for that key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().filter((key) => key !== key).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method would return a list of all the keys in the map, and the `filter()` method would remove the given key from that list, causing the `length` property to be incorrect.

DONE.
