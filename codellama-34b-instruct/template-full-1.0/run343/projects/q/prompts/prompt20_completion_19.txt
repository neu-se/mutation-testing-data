  Sure, I can do that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a keyword that exits the current function, and would exit the `definition` function immediately after assigning the `Q` variable, instead of continuing to execute the remaining code in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that prints a message to the console, and would log a message to the console every time the `definition` function is executed, instead of assigning the `Q` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error message goes here");
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword that throws an exception, and would throw an exception every time the `definition` function is executed, instead of assigning the `Q` variable.

DONE.
