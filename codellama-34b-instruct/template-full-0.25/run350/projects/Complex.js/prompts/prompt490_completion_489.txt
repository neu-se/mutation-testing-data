  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `__esModule` property would be set to `false`, which could cause issues with the module's import and export behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `__esModule` property would be set to `null`, which could cause issues with the module's import and export behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `__esModule` property would be set to `undefined`, which could cause issues with the module's import and export behavior.

DONE.
