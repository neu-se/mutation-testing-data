  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now 2 instead of 1, which would cause the first argument to be excluded from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now 0 instead of 1, which would cause the entire `arguments` object to be included in the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now 2 instead of 1, which would cause only the first two arguments to be included in the resulting array.

DONE.
