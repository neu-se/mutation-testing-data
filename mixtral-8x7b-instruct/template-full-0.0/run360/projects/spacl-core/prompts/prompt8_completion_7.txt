 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.match('//') !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact string '//' instead of a regular expression with the '/' delimiter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/\/\//g.test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the '//' pattern exists in the spec string without considering it as a delimiter for regular expression literals.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(new RegExp('//')).test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new regular expression object with the string '//' and checks if it matches the spec string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
