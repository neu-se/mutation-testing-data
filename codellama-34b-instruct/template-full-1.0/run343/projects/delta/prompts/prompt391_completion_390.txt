  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next value in the iteration, rather than the current value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next value in the iteration, rather than the current value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.current()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current value in the iteration, rather than the next value.

DONE.
