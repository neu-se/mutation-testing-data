  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line checks if the complex number is NaN, while the new line checks if it is not NaN. The negation operator `!` would flip the result of the `isNaN` function, leading to different behavior for cases where the complex number is not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line checks if the complex number is NaN, while the new line checks if it is finite. This would lead to different results for cases where the complex number is infinite or not a number, since `isFinite()` would return `false` in these cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['toString']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line checks if the complex number is NaN, while the new line converts the complex number to a string. The `toString()` method would always return
