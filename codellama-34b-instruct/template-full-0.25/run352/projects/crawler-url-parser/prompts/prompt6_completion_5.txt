  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "https://" to the URL, even if it already starts with "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "http://" to the URL, even if it already starts with "https://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prepend "ftp://" to the URL, even if it already starts with "http://" or "https://".

DONE.
