  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is always truthy, whereas `thisOp.delete` is only truthy if the operation is a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the operation, whereas `thisOp.delete` is a boolean that indicates whether the operation is a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the other operation, whereas `thisOp.delete` is a boolean that indicates whether the operation is a deletion.

DONE.
