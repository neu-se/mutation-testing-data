  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the wrong argument. The `isZero` method checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, but in this case, it is being called with the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the wrong argument. The `isZero` method checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, but in this case, it is being called with the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the original
