  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs`, but the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs`, but the new code fragment pushes `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs`, but the new code fragment pushes `undefined`.

DONE.
