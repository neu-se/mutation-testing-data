  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the expression, so if `seen[key]` is `true`, the result would be `false`, and if `seen[key]` is `false`, the result would be `true`. This would cause the `filter` function to return a different set of items than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator assigns a value to the `seen[key]` variable, so the `filter` function would return a different set of items than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator removes the `key` property from the `seen` object, so the `filter` function would return a different set of items than the original code.

DONE.
