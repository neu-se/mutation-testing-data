  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the longitude before adjusting it, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the longitude by 2 before adjusting it, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the longitude before adjusting it, which could cause the resulting GeoPoint to be different from the original.

DONE.
