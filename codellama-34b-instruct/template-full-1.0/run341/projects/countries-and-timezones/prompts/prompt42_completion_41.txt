  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id + '1', options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different country for each ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true, ...options }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different version of the country, including deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [id]: getCountry(id, { timezones: Object.values(data.timezones) }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different set of timezones for each country.

DONE.
