 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would create a new scope, causing `getOffsetStr` to be treated as an undefined variable inside the function, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the UTC offset for both the standard and daylight savings time offset strings, even if the daylight savings offset is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(Math.abs(dstOffset))
