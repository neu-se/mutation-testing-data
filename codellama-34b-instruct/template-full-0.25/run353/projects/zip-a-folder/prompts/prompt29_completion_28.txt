  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with an error instead of being resolved with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a null value instead of being resolved with no value.

DONE.
