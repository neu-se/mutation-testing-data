  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stackTrace"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new property called "stackTrace" instead of modifying the existing "stack" property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stack" + "Trace"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the "stack" and "Trace" strings, resulting in a different property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stack" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the "stack" string with the number 1, resulting in a different property name.

DONE.
