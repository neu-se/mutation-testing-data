  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for `embedType`, which could cause the `compose`, `invert`, and `transform` functions to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for `embedType`, which could cause the `compose`, `invert`, and `transform` functions to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for `embedType`, which could cause the `compose`, `invert`, and `transform` functions to behave differently.

DONE.
