  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + op.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to return the wrong value, potentially leading to errors in the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + op.retain + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to return the wrong value, potentially leading to errors in the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + op.retain - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to return the wrong value, potentially leading to errors in the `invert` method.

DONE.
