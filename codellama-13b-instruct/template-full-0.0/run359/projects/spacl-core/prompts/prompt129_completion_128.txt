  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the array starting from a different index.

DONE.
