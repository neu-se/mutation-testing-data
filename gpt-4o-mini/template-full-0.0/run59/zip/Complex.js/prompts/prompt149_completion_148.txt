Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both complex numbers are zero instead of checking if either is infinite, which would lead to incorrect handling of multiplication involving infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the first complex number is infinite while the second is not, which would incorrectly classify the multiplication result when both numbers are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if neither complex number is infinite, which would bypass the intended handling of infinite values and potentially lead to incorrect results when one or both numbers are infinite.

DONE.
