  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended != end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of the `ended` variable, potentially causing the function to enter a different branch of execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && ended
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a short-circuit evaluation, where the `ended` variable would only be updated if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional check for `test(data)` before updating the `ended` variable, potentially causing the function to enter a different branch of execution.

DONE.
