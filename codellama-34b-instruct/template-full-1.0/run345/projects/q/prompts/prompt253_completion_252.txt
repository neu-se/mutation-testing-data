  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise and would cause an error when attempting to call the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object does not have a `promiseDispatch` method and would cause an error when attempting to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `promise` property of the `newPromise` object, which does not exist.

DONE.
