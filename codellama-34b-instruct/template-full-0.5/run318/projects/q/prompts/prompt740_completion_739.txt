  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, while `Q.defer()` is a function call that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer.reject` is a function that rejects a promise, while `Q.defer()` is a function call that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, while `Q.defer()` is a function call that returns a promise.

DONE.
