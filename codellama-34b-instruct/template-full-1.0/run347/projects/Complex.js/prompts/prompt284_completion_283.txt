  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would subtract `1` from the value of `a`, while the original `a` expression simply refers to the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * a` expression would multiply `a` by `b`, while the original `a` expression simply refers to the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression would add `a` and `b`, while the original `a` expression simply refers to the value of `a`.

DONE.
