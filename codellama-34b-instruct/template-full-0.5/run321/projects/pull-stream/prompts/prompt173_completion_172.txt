  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the value is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the value is not an array. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the value is not an array, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks if the array has a length of 0, while `!Array.isArray` checks if the value is not an array. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the array has a length of 0, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` checks if the array has a length
