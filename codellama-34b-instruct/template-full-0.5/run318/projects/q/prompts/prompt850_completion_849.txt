  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error == "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the error is equal to the string "string", rather than checking if the error is not defined or if it is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error != "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the error is not equal to the string "string", rather than checking if the error is not defined or if it is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof error !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the error is not a string, rather than checking if the error is not defined or if it is a string.

DONE.
