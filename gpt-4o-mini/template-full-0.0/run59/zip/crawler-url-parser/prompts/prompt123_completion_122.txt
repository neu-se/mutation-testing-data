Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an iterator of the keys in the `urlMap` instead of the values, leading to a situation where the resulting array would contain the keys rather than the URL objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of key-value pairs (tuples) from the `urlMap`, instead of just the values, which would change the structure of the resulting array and potentially break the subsequent mapping logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values()).filter(url => url.type === 'internal')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter the values to only include those with a type of 'internal', thus potentially omitting other URLs from the final result that do not meet this condition.

DONE.
