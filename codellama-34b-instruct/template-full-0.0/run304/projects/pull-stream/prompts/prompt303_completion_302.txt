  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so the `read` function would be called with `true` instead of `ended`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, so the `read` function would never be called, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, so the `read` function would always be called, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
