  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `null` is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes an argument, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes an argument, but the new function `function() {}` does not take any arguments and would cause a type error.

DONE.
