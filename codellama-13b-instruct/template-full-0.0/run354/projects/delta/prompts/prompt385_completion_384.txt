  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return an incorrect index if the `index` parameter is greater than or equal to the length of the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return an incorrect index if the `index` parameter is less than the length of the `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(otherIter.peekLength() / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would return an incorrect index if the `index` parameter is not a multiple of the length of the `other` delta.

DONE.
