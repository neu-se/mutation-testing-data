  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected.apply` would be called instead of `fulfilled.apply`, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled.call` would be called instead of `fulfilled.apply`, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled.bind` would be called instead of `fulfilled.apply`, which could cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

DONE.
