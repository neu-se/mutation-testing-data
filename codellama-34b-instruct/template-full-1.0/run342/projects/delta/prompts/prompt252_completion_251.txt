  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` and `thisIter` are two different iterators, and replacing `thisIter.next()` with `otherIter.next()` would cause the code to advance through the wrong iterator, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects a valid iterator method to be returned, but `null` would cause it to return nothing instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('PLACEHOLDER')
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects a valid iterator method to be returned, but `new Error()` would cause it to throw an error instead.

DONE.
