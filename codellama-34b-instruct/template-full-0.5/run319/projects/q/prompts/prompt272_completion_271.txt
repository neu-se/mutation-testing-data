  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.push(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `progress` value onto the `progressListeners` array, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `progressListeners` array, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `progressListeners` array, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
