  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it adds 1 to the value of `x`, which can cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it subtracts 1 from the value of `x`, which can cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This code fragment is equivalent to the original code fragment, but it multiplies the value of `x` by 2, which can cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
