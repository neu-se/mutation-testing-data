  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method would return `null` instead of an array of property names, causing the `embedType` variable to be set to `null` instead of the expected string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method would return `undefined` instead of an array of property names, causing the `embedType` variable to be set to `undefined` instead of the expected string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys()` method would return an empty array instead of an array of property names, causing the `embedType` variable to be set to an empty string instead of the expected string value.

DONE.
