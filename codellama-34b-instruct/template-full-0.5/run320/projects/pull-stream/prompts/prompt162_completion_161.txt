  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `false` would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `null` would always return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `!value` would return the opposite of the value of `value`.

DONE.
