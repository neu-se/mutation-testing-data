  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(!looping)
```
This would result in different behavior because `if(!looping)` is always `false` when `looping` is defined as `true`, therefore, the `if` statement will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(looping)
```
This would result in different behavior because `if(looping)` is always `true` when `looping` is defined as `true`, therefore, the `if` statement will always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(!looping && cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `if(!looping && cb)` is always `false` when `looping` is defined as `true` and `cb` is defined as a function, therefore, the `if` statement will never be executed.

DONE.
