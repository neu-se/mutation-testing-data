  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with 'http://', while this new code fragment replaces it with 'https://'. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + window.location.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with 'http://', while this new code fragment adds the current hostname to the protocol. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + baseUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the protocol with 'http://', while this new code fragment adds the hostname of the base URL to the protocol. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

DONE.
