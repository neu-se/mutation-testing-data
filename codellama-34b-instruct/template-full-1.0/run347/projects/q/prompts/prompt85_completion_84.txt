  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    fulfill([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called, which is necessary to clear the task queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, but the `flush` function expects a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    flush(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function expects a task object as its argument, and passing `null` would result in a reference error.

DONE.
