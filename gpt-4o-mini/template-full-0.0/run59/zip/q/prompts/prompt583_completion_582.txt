Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Generator execution failed"));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of continuing the generator execution, it immediately rejects the promise with an error, which would change the flow of the program and potentially lead to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the `callback` with the `result.value` instead of the `result` object, which could lead to incorrect handling of the generator's yielded values and disrupt the intended flow of execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to the entire `result` object instead of continuing with the `callback`, which would prevent the generator from yielding its values correctly and alter the expected asynchronous behavior.

DONE.
