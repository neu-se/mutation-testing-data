  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called twice, which could cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a different argument, which could affect the compression level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a different argument, which could affect the compression level.

DONE.
