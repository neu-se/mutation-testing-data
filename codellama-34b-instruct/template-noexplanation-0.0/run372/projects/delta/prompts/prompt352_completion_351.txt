  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This change will cause the `invert` method to use the attributes of the `otherOp` instead of the `baseOp`, which may result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, thisOp.attributes
```
This change will cause the `invert` method to use the attributes of the `thisOp` instead of the `baseOp`, which may result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This change will cause the `invert` method to use the attributes of the `otherOp` instead of the `thisOp`, which may result in different behavior.

DONE.
