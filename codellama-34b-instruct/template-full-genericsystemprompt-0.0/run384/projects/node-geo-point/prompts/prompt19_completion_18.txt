  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!object` would always return `false` for any object, including the `LatLng` object that is passed to the `fromObject` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `LatLng` object has both `latitude` and `longitude` properties, but it would return `false` if the object has any other properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('altitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the `LatLng` object has all three properties (`latitude`, `longitude`, and `altitude`), but
