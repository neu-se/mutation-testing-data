Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit` function to be called with `null` instead of the actual promise, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `process.emit` function from being called at all, as `undefined` would not match any valid promise, thus not reporting the rejection as handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the current context instead of the promise being untracked, which could lead to incorrect reporting of the rejection handling status.

DONE.
