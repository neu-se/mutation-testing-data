  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.loade
```
This would result in different behavior because `loade` is not a valid method of the `cheerio` library, and the program would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.otlin
```
This would result in different behavior because `otlin` is not a valid jQuery method, and the program would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fluorite.load
```
This would result in different behavior because `fluorite` is not a real-world web framework, and the program would throw an error.

DONE.
