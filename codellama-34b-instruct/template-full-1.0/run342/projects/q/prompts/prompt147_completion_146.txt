  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter * 2, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stackCounter * 2` would always be twice the original value, which could cause incorrect results in certain calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter - 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stackCounter - 1` would always be one less than the original value, which could cause incorrect results in certain calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: p.stackCounter + 1, configurable: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because `p.stackCounter + 1` would always be one more than the original value, which could cause incorrect results in certain calculations.

DONE.
