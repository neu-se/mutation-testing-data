  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr, baseUrlStr)

This could potentially result in a different URL being parsed, which could in turn affect the results of the `extract` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(embedBaseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr` is not passed as an argument to `parse`, whereas in the original code, it is passed as the second argument. This could potentially result in a different URL being parsed, which could in turn affect the results of the `extract` function.
