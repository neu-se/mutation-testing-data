  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be called with `null` instead of the resolved value, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be called with `undefined` instead of the resolved value, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be called with the string `"foo"` instead of the resolved value, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
