  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain == pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `===` operator, which compares both the value and the type of the variables. In contrast, this replacement code uses the `==` operator, which compares only the value of the variables and would return `true` even if the types are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host !== pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `==` operator, which compares only the value of the variables. In contrast, this replacement code uses the `!==` operator, which compares both the value and the type of the variables and would return `false` if the types are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain !== pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `===` operator, which compares both the value
