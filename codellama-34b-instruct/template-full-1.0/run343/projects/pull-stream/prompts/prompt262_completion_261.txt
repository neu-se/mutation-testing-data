  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.toString()` would convert the error object to a string, whereas the original code fragment returned the error object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'some error message'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'some error message'` is not an instance of the `Error` class, whereas the original code fragment expected an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an instance of the `Error` class, whereas the original code fragment expected an error object.

DONE.
