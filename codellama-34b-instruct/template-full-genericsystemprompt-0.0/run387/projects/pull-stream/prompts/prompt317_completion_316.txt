  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the data, even if the test fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, even if the test passes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Test failed'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an error, even if the test passes.

DONE.
