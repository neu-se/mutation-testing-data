  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 == c
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be checking for equality between `c` and `0`, which is not the same as checking if `d` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be checking for inequality between `d` and `0`, which is not the same as checking if `d` is equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be checking if `d` is equal to `1`, which is not the same as checking if `d` is equal to `0`.

DONE.
