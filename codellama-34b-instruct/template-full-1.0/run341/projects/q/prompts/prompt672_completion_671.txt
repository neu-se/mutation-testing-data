  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a different function than `Q`, and it has a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.mcall(key, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mcall` is a different method than `post`, and it has a different implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).set(name, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a different method than `dispatch`, and it has a different implementation.

DONE.
