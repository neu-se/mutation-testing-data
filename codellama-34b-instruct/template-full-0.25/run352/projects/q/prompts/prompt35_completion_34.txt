  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the argument to the `task` function, which would not occur in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the argument to the `task` function, which would not occur in the original code.

DONE.
