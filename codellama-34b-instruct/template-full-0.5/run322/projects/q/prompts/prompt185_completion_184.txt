  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the third element of the `attempt1` array, instead of the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the first element of the `attempt1` array, instead of the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the second element of the `attempt2` array, instead of the second element of the `attempt1` array.

DONE.
