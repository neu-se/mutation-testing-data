  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter is not passed to the `plural` function, which would cause the function to return the original word without any changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter is not passed to the `plural` function, which would cause the function to return the original word without any changes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` parameter is not passed to the `plural` function, which would cause the function to return the original word without any changes.

DONE.
