  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `set` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `set` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, ""]
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string value would be passed as an additional argument to the `set` method, which may cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
