  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with an incorrect argument, which would cause the method to return `false` even if the complex number is actually zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this['re']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, which would cause the method to return `true` even if the complex number is not actually zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is being called with the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which would cause the method to return `true` even if the complex number is not actually zero.

DONE.
