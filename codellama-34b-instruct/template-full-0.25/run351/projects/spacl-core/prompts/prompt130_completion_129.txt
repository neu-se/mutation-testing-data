  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error if the array is not large enough.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, potentially missing the last element in the array.

DONE.
