  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of `a` instead of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `2 * b` instead of using the original value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result of `2 * b` instead of using the original value of `b`.

DONE.
