Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call a method on `null`, whereas the original code correctly uses the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the current context of the function instead of the `promise` object, potentially leading to unexpected results if `this` is not what the code expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to a `TypeError` when trying to access properties or methods on `undefined`, unlike the original code which uses the `promise` object correctly.

DONE.
