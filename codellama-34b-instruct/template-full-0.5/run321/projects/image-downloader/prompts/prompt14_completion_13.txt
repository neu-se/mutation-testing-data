  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"filename"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeURIComponent` function would return the string "filename", which is not the same as the original `basename` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename` function would return the last portion of the `options.dest` path, which may not be the same as the `basename` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname` function would return the file extension of the `options.dest` path, which may not be the same as the `basename` variable.

DONE.
