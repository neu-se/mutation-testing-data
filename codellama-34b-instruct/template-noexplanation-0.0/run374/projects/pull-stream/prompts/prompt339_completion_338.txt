  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This change will cause the `unique` function to return a different result for the same input, as it will add 1 to the `field` value before checking if it has already been seen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This change will cause the `unique` function to return a different result for the same input, as it will multiply the `field` value by 2 before checking if it has already been seen.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `unique` function to return a different result for the same input, as it will convert the `field` value to lowercase before checking if it has already been seen.

DONE.
