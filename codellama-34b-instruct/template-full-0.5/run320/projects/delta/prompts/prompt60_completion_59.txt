  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, but this replacement checks if the argument is a number, which could result in a different outcome if the argument is not a string or does not have a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, but this replacement checks if the argument has a length greater than 0, which could result in a different outcome if the argument is a string with a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the argument is a string and has a length of 0, but this replacement checks if the argument is falsy, which could result in a different outcome if the argument
