  Mutation Testing for the parse Function:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `0` instead of a url object, which would cause any tests that depend on the returned value to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return parsedUrl.protocol + '://' + parsedUrl.host;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a string with the protocol and host of the url instead of a url object, which would cause any tests that depend on the returned value to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error('Invalid URL');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would throw an error instead of returning a url object, which would cause any tests that depend on the returned value to fail.

Conclusion: DONE.
