Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('#')[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `split` instead of `replace`, which would not remove the fragment identifier if it appears multiple times in the URL, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, 'http://example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the fragment with a fixed URL (`http://example.com`), which would change the intended URL structure and could lead to incorrect results in URL parsing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, ''); // removing the fragment
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the fragment identifier but does not account for any potential query parameters that might follow it, which could lead to loss of important information in the URL.

DONE.
