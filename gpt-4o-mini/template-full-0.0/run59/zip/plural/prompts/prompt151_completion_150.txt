Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'word'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the string 'word' to the `plural` function, regardless of the actual string on which the method is called, leading to incorrect pluralization results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `num` variable (which is intended to represent the number) to the `plural` function instead of the string itself, causing the function to operate on a number rather than the intended word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` to the `plural` function, which would not match any rules and would always return the default pluralization (adding 's'), regardless of the actual word being pluralized.

DONE.
