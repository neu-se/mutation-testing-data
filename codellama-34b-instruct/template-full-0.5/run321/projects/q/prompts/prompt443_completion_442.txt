  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error message to be printed in lowercase, which may not be desirable in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error message to be printed without the stack trace, which may not provide enough information to diagnose the problem.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the error message to be printed without the stack trace, which may not provide enough information to diagnose the problem.

DONE.
