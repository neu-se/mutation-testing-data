  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `atan2` function is changed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` and `cos` functions would be applied to twice the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` and `cos` functions would be applied to `b` times pi.

DONE.
