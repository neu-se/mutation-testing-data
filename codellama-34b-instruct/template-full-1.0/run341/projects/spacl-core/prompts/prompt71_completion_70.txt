  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb.toLowerCase()` would be undefined if `verb` is not a string, whereas `verb` would be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb.slice(1)` would be a string slice, whereas `verb` would be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb.length` would be a number, whereas `verb` would be a string.

DONE.
