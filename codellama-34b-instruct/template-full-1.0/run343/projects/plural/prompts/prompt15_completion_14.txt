  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last character of the word instead of the length of the word minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the word without its first character instead of the length of the word minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the word without its first character instead of the length of the word minus 1.

DONE.
