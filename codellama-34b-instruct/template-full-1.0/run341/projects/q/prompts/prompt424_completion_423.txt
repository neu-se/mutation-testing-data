  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` immediately rejects a promise with the provided reason, whereas the original code fragment checks the state of the promise and only rejects it if it is not already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` immediately resolves a promise with the provided value, whereas the original code fragment checks the state of the promise and only resolves it if it is not already resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the code to always return `null` instead of the fulfilled value, which would cause any code that expects a fulfilled value to fail.

DONE.
