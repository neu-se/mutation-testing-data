  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `unshift` method to add a new rule to the `rules` array, while the modified code fragment is using the `push` method to add a new rule to the end of the `rules` array. This could potentially cause the new rule to be applied before the original rule, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `substr` method to remove the last letter of the word and add the
