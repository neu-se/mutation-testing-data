  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value or another promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error, while `reject` will reject the promise with the specified reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, while `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason.

DONE.
