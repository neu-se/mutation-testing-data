  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['isFinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number is infinite or not, while this new code checks if the number is both infinite and finite, which is a contradiction and will always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || this['isFinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number is infinite or not, while this new code checks if the number is either infinite or finite, which will always return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && !this['isFinite']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number is infinite or not, while this new code checks if the number is both infinite and not finite, which is a contradiction and will always return false.
