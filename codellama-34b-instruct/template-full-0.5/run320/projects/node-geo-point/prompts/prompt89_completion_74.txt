  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos(φ1)` and `sin(φ1)` terms would be swapped, leading to a different value for `x` and `y`, which would in turn affect the final calculation of `λ2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) - cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin(φ1)` and `cos(φ1)` terms would be swapped, leading to a different value for `x` and `y`, which would in turn affect the final calculation of `λ2`.
