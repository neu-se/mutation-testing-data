Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(end - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly retrieves one extra operation than intended, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect slicing of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(start - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves an operation that is one more than the intended range, which could cause the slice to include unintended operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it always retrieves the first operation regardless of the current index, leading to incorrect slicing and potentially returning an empty or incorrect Delta.

DONE.
