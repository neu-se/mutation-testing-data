  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `/` as the path separator, while the new code fragment uses `\` as the path separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `/` as the path separator, while the new code fragment uses `\` as the path separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `/` as the path separator, while the new code fragment uses `\` as the path separator.

DONE.
