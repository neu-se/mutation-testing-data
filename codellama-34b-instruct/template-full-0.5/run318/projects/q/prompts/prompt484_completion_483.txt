  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a shallow copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, instead of a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array by concatenating the `unhandledReasons` array with an empty array, instead of returning a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.filter(function() { return true; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing only the elements of the `unhandledReasons` array that pass the filter function, instead of returning a reference to the original array.

DONE.
