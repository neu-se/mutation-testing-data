  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = <PLACEHOLDER>(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not being called, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point1.latitude) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is being called with a different argument, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = deg2rad(point1.latitude) + Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is being called with a different argument, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
