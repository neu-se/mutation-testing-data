  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `$(this).attr('href') || ""`. This would result in different behavior because if the `href` attribute is missing or empty, the code will return an empty string rather than `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `$(this).attr('href') === null`. This would result in different behavior because if the `href` attribute is missing or empty, the code will treat it as if it were equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `$(this).attr('href') !== ''`. This would result in different behavior because if the `href` attribute is missing or empty, the code will treat it as if it were not equal to the empty string.

DONE.
