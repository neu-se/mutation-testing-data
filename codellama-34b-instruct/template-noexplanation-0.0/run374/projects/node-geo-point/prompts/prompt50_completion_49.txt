  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the bearing in degrees instead of radians, which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the bearing in radians, which is the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 180)
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return the bearing in degrees, which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
