  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `base.slice` is a valid method call, but with `undefined`, it would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `base.slice` is a valid method call, but with `null`, it would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.splice` is a valid method, but it has a different behavior than `base.slice`, such as modifying the original array instead of returning a new one.

DONE.
