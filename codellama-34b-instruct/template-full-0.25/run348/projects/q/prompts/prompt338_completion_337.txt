  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise, while `inspect` is a property that contains the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is a property that contains the current state of the promise, while `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.value` is a property that contains the resolved value of the promise, while `inspect` is a function that returns an object with information about the promise.

DONE.
