  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(op, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `drain` would be made without passing any arguments, whereas the original code fragment passes in `op` and `done` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain()
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `drain` would be made without passing any arguments, whereas the original code fragment passes in `op` and `done` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `drain` would be made with `null` as the first argument, whereas the original code fragment passes in `op` as the first argument.

DONE.
