Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.replaceEntitiesValue.bind(null, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that has its `this` keyword set to `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the `replaceEntitiesValue` method relies on the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(textValue) { return textValue; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this replacement function does not perform any entity replacement, effectively bypassing the entity replacement logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.replaceEntitiesValue(val, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replaceEntitiesValue` method is called with an additional argument `true`, which could potentially alter its behavior if the method is designed to handle this extra argument, or cause an error if it is not.

DONE.
