  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` would add a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` would add all files matching the glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` would add a directory to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` would add all files matching the glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.finalize` would finalize the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` would add all files matching the glob pattern.

DONE.
