  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only take the first element of the args array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would remove the last element of the args array, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would pass an empty array, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
