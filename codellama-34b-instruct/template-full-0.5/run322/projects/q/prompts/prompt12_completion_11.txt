  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the variable `ses` is a string, while this replacement checks if it is not a string.

DONE.
