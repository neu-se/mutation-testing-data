  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated), options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return a new array with only the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code fragment would return all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name), options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return an array of timezone names, whereas the original code fragment would return an array of timezone objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reduce((acc, tz) => acc + tz.offset, 0), options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return the sum of all timezone offsets, whereas the original code fragment would return an array of timezone objects.

DONE.
