  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `_load` method is never called, which means that the database file is never loaded, and the `load` event is never emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { throw new Error('Test error'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_load` method is now throwing an error, which means that the `load` event is never emitted, and any code that relies on the database being loaded will fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this.emit('load', 1); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event is now emitted with a different number of arguments, which could cause any code that listens for the `load` event to fail.

DONE.
