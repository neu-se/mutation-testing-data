  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextType` is not a valid property of `otherIter`, whereas `peekType` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` is not the same object as `otherIter`, and `peekType` would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns a string, and adding the `length` property would return the length of the string, rather than the expected type.

DONE.
