  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `nbind` is a different method than `npost`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `ninvoke` is a different method than `npost`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nmcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nmcall` is a different method than `npost`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
