  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a == inf```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` is a function that checks whether a number is a finite number, while `a == inf` is a comparison that checks whether `a` is equal to the string `"inf"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a > 1.7976931348623157e+308```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks whether a number is finite, while `a > 1.7976931348623157e+308` checks whether `a` is greater than the maximum finite number in JavaScript.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```isFinite(a) && a < 4503599627370496```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` is a function
