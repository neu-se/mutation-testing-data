  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(" FooBar");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a promise that eventually resolves with a value, while this replacement code throws an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a promise that is eventually resolved with a value, while this replacement code returns a promise that is eventually resolved with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a promise that eventually resolves with a value, while this replacement code returns a promise that is eventually resolved with the value `1`.

DONE
