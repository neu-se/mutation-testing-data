  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!pendingCount
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` would be resolved as soon as the first promise in the array is resolved, whereas the original code would only resolve `allResolved` once all promises have been resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` would only be resolved when the promise array is empty, whereas the original code would resolve `allResolved` when all promises have been resolved or rejected, regardless of the size of the promise array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` would only be resolved when there are still promises left to be resolved, whereas the original code would resolve `allResolved` once all promises have been resolved or rejected, regardless of their completion.

DONE.
