 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a next operation, rather than checking if there is a next operation to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasPrevious()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there is a previous operation, rather than checking if there is a next operation to iterate over.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekType() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there is a type for the next operation, rather than checking if there is a next operation to iterate over.

DONE.
