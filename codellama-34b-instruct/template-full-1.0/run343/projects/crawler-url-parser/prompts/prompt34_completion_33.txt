  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` argument is not the same as the `baseUrlStr` variable, which is not a valid URL. The code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `baseUrlStr` argument would prevent the URL from being parsed as a base URL. The code would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `true` value for the `baseUrlStr` argument would cause the URL to be parsed as a base URL, even if it is not a valid URL. The code would produce a different result.

DONE.
