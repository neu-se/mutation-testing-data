  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tgz"
```
This would result in different behavior because the compressed file would have the extension ".tgz" instead of ".tar.gz".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the compressed file would have the extension ".tar" instead of ".tar.gz".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the compressed file would have the extension ".zip" instead of ".tar.gz".

DONE.
