  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would call the callback function with no arguments, while this replacement would call it with two arguments, `null` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would call the callback function with no arguments, while this replacement would call it with one argument, `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cb`, which would call the callback function with no arguments, while this replacement would call it with two arguments, both `null`.

DONE.
