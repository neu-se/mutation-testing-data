Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would change the calculation of the x component in the bearing formula, leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cos(Δλ)` with `1` would ignore the effect of the longitude difference on the bearing calculation, resulting in incorrect bearing values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using `tan` instead of `cos` would fundamentally alter the calculation of the x component in the bearing formula, leading to incorrect results for the bearing angle.

DONE.
