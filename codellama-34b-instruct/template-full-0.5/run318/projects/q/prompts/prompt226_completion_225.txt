  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `arguments` object, which would change the value of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `arguments` object, which would be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.callee
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the function that is currently being executed, which would be different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
