  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the entire `args` array as a single argument, while the new code would pass each element of the `args` array as a separate argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the entire `args` array as a single argument, while the new code would pass a copy of the `args` array as a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would pass the entire `args` array as a single argument, while the new code would pass a nested array containing the `args` array twice as two separate arguments.

DONE.
