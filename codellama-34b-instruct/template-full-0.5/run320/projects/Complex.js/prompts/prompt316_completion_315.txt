  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and the `sin` function would be applied to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is a different value than `a`, and the `sin` function would be applied to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a)` is a different value than `a`, and the `sin` function would be applied to a different value.

DONE.
