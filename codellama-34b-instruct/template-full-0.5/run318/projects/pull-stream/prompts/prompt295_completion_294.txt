  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && true` will always evaluate to `true` if `err` is truthy, whereas `err || true` will only evaluate to `true` if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ^ true` will always evaluate to `true` if `err` is truthy, whereas `err || true` will only evaluate to `true` if `err` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err || true` will always evaluate to `true` if `err` is falsy, whereas `err || true` will only evaluate to `true` if `err` is truthy.

DONE.
