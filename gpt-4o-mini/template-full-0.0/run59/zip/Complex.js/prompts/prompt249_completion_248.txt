Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part of the complex number, which changes the output of the `expm1` function, potentially leading to incorrect results when calculating the complex exponential minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the real part `a` with the imaginary part `b`, which would incorrectly compute the exponential function based on the imaginary component instead of the real component, leading to an incorrect complex result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the logarithm of `a + 1` instead of `a`, which could lead to unexpected results, especially when `a` is zero or negative, affecting the overall calculation of the complex exponential minus one.

DONE.
