  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a null value, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the original value, rather than being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(deferred.reject, deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the original value, rather than being resolved.

DONE.
