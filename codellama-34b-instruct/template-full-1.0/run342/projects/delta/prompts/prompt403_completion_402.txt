  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the given object's own enumerable string-keyed property values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `values` property of the `Object` prototype object, which is not the same as the `Object.values` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `values` property of the `Object.keys` method, which does not exist.

DONE.
