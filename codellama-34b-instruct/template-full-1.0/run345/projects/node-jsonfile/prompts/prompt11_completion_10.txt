  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would fail to parse a valid JSON object, causing the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would fail to parse a valid JSON object, causing the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to parse an empty string as a JSON object.

Note: These code fragments are intended to be simple and easy to understand, but they are not intended to be valid JSON parsers. In a real-world scenario, you would need to provide more complex code fragments that test the parser thoroughly.
