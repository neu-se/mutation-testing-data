 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality to `undefined`, whereas the original code checks if the value is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `value` to be `'undefined'`, whereas the original code checks if the value is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict inequality with `null`, whereas the original code checks if the value is not `null` or `undefined`. This means that if `value` is `undefined`, the function would continue executing the first branch, which was not the case in the original code.

DONE.
