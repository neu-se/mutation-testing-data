  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === a && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex` constructor to be called with a real number, `b`, as the second argument. In the original code, the second argument is always a complex number, represented by a JavaScript object with two properties, `re` and `im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex` constructor to be called with a negative real number, `a`, as the first argument. In the original code, the first argument is always a positive real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex` constructor to be called with a negative real number, `a`, as the first argument, and a real number, `b`, as the second argument (which is 0).
