  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was subtracting 1 from the complex number, while this replacement would add 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was subtracting 1 from the complex number, while this replacement would subtract 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was subtracting 1 from the complex number, while this replacement would multiply the imaginary part by 2.

DONE.
