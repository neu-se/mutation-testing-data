 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always skip the `become` call, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always call `become` with `null` as the argument, which might not be the desired resolution value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` function would always call `become` with the `messages` array, which is not a promise object and would likely cause errors in further promise resolution steps.

DONE.
