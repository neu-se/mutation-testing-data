  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point` is an object and has the properties `type` and `coordinates`, while this new code fragment checks if `point` does not have the properties `type` and `coordinates`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point.type` is equal to `'Point'`, while this new code fragment checks if `point.type` is not equal to `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `point.coordinates` is an array with 2 elements, while this new code fragment checks if `point.coordinates` is not an array with
