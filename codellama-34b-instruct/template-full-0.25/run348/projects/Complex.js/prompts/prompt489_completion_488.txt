  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `false` instead of `true`, indicating that the number is not NaN, even if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': NaN }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `true` instead of `false`, indicating that the number is NaN, even if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': Infinity }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `false` instead of `true`, indicating that the number is not NaN, even if it is infinite.

DONE.
