  Here are three different options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - Math.min(thisIter.nextLength, Math.max(0, index - offset));
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.nextLength` rather than `thisIter.peekLength()` is used to calculate the length of the next operation in the iteration. This would cause the mutation to have a different effect on the length of the operation that is being transformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - Math.min(thisIter.ops.length - 1, index - offset);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops.length - 1` rather than `thisIter.peekLength()` is used to calculate the length of the next operation in the iteration. This would cause the mutation to have a different effect on the length of the operation that is being transformed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
