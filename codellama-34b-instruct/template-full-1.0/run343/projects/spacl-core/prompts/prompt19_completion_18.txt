  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `string` to be empty, but still require it to end with a `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 || string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `string` to be empty, but still require it to end with a `/`, or have a length greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 2 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `string` to be empty, but still require it to end with a `/`, or have a length greater than 2.

DONE.
