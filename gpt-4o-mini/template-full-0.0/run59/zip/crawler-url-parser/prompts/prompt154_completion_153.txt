Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the last segment of the path without allowing for an optional trailing slash, potentially leading to incorrect path comparisons when the last segment is followed by a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, which could lead to unexpected matches if the path contains uppercase letters, altering the intended logic of the path comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would allow for global matching, which could result in multiple matches being found in the path, rather than just the last segment, leading to incorrect behavior in determining the relationship between the URLs.

DONE.
