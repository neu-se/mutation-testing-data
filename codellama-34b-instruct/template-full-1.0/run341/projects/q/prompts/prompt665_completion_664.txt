  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a built-in object and `array_slice` is a function, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve([1,2,3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would directly resolve the promise with `[1,2,3]`, instead of processing the array of promises passed to `Q.all`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause the function to throw an error, instead of returning a promise.

DONE.
