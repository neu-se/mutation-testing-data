  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nbind` method expects a function as its first argument, and passing `null` would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nbind` method expects a function as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nbind` method expects a function as its first argument, and passing an empty function would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
