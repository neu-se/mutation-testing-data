  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with two arguments, `null` and `data`. This would cause the test to fail, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with a single argument, `abort`. This would cause the test to fail, indicating that the test suite is not effective in detecting this type of error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('aborted'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with a single argument, a new `Error` object with the
