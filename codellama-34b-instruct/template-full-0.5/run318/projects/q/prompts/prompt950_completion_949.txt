  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` refers to the `this` context of the function, while `undefined` would result in the global context being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` refers to the `this` context of the function, while `null` would result in the global context being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` refers to the `this` context of the function, while `{}` would result in an empty object being used.

DONE.
