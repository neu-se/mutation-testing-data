  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `otherOp` is an object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the check to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `otherOp` is an object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `otherOp` is an object, but replacing it with an empty object would cause the check to pass.

DONE.
