 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] instanceof RegExp && rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `rule[0]` is an instance of `RegExp` instead of comparing the type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'RegExp' && rule[0].exec(word)
