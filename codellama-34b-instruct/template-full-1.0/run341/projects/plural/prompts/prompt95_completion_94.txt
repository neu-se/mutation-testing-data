  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?cat$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression does not match the word "woman" anymore, but it would match the word "cat".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?(man\.|cat)$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match both "woman" and "cat", but not "woman.cat".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment because the regular expression still matches the word "woman".

DONE.
