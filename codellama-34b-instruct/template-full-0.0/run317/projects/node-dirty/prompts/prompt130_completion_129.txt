  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `this._queue` array by removing the first element, which would cause the loop to skip over the first element in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `this._queue` array by removing the last element, which would cause the loop to skip over the last element in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `this._queue` array by removing the first element, but it would not modify the original array, which would cause the loop to skip over the first element in the queue.

DONE.
