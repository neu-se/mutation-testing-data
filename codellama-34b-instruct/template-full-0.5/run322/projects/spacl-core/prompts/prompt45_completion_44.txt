  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the regular expression `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. By changing the operator to `=== null`, the code will now check if the part does not match the regular expression `:.+`, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the part matches the regular expression `:.+`, which means it contains a colon followed by one or more characters. By changing the operator to `!== null`, the code will now check if the part does not match the regular expression `:.+`, which means it does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/)
