  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this modified code fragment checks if it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this modified code fragment checks if it is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while this modified code fragment checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
