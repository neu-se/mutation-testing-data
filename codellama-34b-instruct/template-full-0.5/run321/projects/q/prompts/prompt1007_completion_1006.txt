  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that creates a shallow copy of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.length` returns the number of elements in the array, while `array_slice.length + 1` returns the number of elements plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` creates a new array with each element incremented by one, while `array_slice` creates a shallow copy of the original array.

DONE.
