  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `equals` method would now check if the real part of the complex number is equal to 0, rather than checking if the imaginary part is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `equals` method would now check if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to 0, rather than checking if the imaginary part is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
