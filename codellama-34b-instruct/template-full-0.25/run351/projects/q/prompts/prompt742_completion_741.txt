  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled`, `onRejected`, and `onProgress` functions would not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
