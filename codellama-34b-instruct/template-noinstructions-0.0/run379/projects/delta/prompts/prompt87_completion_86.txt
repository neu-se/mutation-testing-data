  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of `newOp` to be overwritten with the value of `lastOp.attributes`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of `newOp` to be a shallow copy of `lastOp.attributes`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `attributes` property of `newOp` to be a deep copy of `lastOp.attributes`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
