  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of the promise, which would change the final output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of the promise by 2, which would change the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result - 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of the promise, which would change the final output.

DONE.
