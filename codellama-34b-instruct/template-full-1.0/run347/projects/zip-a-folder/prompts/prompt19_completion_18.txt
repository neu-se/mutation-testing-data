  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const targetBasePath = ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the path is now empty, and the `access` method would return an error for any input path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== '' && !isGlob(targetBasePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now evaluate to `false` for any non-glob input path, and the `access` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `access` method would be called with the `targetBasePath` variable, which may not have the same permissions as the original `targetFilePath`.

DONE.
