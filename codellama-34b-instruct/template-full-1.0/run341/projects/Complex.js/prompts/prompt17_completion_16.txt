  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `abs` method to find the absolute value of the input, which is not the same as simply using the `abs` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `abs` method to find the absolute value of the input, which is not the same as simply negating the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `abs` method to find the absolute value of the input, which is not the same as simply adding one to the input.

DONE.
