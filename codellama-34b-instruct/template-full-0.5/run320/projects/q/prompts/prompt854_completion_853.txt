  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"timeoutId"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "timeoutId" is not a valid identifier, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the timeoutId variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the timeout to be delayed or skipped altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would be passed as the first argument to the clearTimeout function, which would cause an error because clearTimeout expects a number or a timer object.

DONE.
