  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.on("unhandledRejection", ...)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` sends an event to all listeners, while `process.on` adds a new listener to the event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.off("unhandledRejection", ...)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.off` removes a listener from the event, while `process.emit` sends an event to all listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.once("unhandledRejection", ...)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.once` adds a new listener to the event that will be automatically removed after the first time the event is triggered, while `process.emit` sends an event to all listeners.

DONE.
