  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a call to the `addRule` function with two string arguments, but this replacement code fragment is a call to the `addRule` function with a single string argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a call to the `addRule` function with a string and a function as arguments, but this replacement code fragment is a call to the `addRule` function with a string and a function that returns a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memoes')
