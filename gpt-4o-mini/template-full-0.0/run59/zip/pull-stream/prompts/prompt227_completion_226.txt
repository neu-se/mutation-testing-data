Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the data directly instead of applying the test function, leading to incorrect filtering of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the negation to the result of the test function, effectively reversing the intended filtering logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out data that passes the test (returns true) instead of those that fail, which is the opposite of the intended functionality.

DONE.
