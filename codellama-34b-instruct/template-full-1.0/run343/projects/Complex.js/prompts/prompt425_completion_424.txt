  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ceiling(places);
```
This would result in different behavior because `ceiling` is a function that is not defined in the `Complex` class, and would therefore cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.floor(places);
```
This would result in different behavior because `floor` is a function that is already defined in the `Complex` class, but it takes a different number of arguments than `ceiling`. This would cause the `floor` function to be called with the incorrect number of arguments, resulting in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.round(places);
```
This would result in different behavior because `round` is a function that is already defined in the `Complex` class, but it takes a different number of arguments than `ceiling`. This would cause the `round` function to be called with the incorrect number of arguments
