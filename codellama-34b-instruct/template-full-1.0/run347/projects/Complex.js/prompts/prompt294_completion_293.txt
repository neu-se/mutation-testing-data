  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would be redundant, as `a` already represents the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would take the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `log` function would take the ratio of the imaginary and real parts, instead of the product.

DONE.
