  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `country === null` would always be false, even if `country` is a null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `country.length` would always be undefined, even if `country` is an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(country).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `country` is an object, and `Object.keys(country).length` would always be 0, even if `country` is an empty object.

DONE.
