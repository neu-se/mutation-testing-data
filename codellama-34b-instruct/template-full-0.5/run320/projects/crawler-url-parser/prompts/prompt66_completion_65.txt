  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on "=", while this replacement splits it on "&". This would cause the code to treat the search string differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on "=", while this replacement returns the length of the search string. This would cause the code to treat the search string differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\?/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on "=", while this replacement splits it on "?". This would cause the code to treat the search string differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
