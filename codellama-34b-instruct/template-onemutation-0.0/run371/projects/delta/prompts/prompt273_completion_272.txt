  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to be called on `otherOp` instead of `thisOp`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the two objects have different implementations of the `retain` method.

DONE.
