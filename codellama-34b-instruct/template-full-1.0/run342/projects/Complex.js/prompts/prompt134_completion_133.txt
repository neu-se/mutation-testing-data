  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), while this code uses the logical AND operator (`&&`). This would cause the code to return `Complex.INFINITY` when either `this` or `z` are infinite, rather than when both are.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!`), while this code uses `===` to check if the difference between `this.re` and `z.re` is exactly 0. This would cause the code to return `Complex.NAN` when `this.re` and `z.re` are equal, rather than when they are not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im
