  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would set the maximum stack counter instead of the minimum, which could cause the program to behave differently when dealing with stack overflows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would set the stack counter to a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently when dealing with stack overflows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackSize__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would set the stack size to a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently when dealing with stack overflows.

DONE.
