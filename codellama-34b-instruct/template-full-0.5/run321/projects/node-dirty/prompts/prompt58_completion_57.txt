  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that destroys the stream, whereas `close` is a method that closes the stream, but does not destroy it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a method that ends the stream, whereas `close` is a method that closes the stream, but does not end it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close
```
This would result in different behavior because `close` is a method that closes the stream, whereas `end` is a method that ends the stream, but does not close it.

DONE.
