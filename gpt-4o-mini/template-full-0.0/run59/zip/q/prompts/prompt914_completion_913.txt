Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the array `[1, 2, 3]` as arguments to the callback instead of the actual arguments provided to the function, potentially leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the arguments to the callback, which would not match the expected input and could cause the callback to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the context of the current object (`this`) instead of the actual arguments, which could lead to incorrect execution of the callback if it relies on specific argument values.

DONE.
