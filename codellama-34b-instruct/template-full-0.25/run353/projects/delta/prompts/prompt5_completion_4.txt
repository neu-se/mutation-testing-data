  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` instead of `false` when `keepNull` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` instead of `false` when `keepNull` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of `true` when `keepNull` is `true`.

DONE.
