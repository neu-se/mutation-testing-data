  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]{2,}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only matches URLs with a single-character extension (e.g., ".a"), while the modified code would match URLs with any number of characters in the extension (e.g., ".abc").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only matches URLs with a specific format (i.e., the "default" keyword followed by a single-character extension), while the modified code would match any URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only matches URLs with a specific format (i.e., the "default" keyword followed by a single-character extension) and "default" is a keyword for HTML content, while the modified code would match any URL.

DONE.
