  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pipe` is a method that pipes the response data to a destination stream, whereas `createWriteStream(dest)` creates a new write stream to the file specified by `dest`. Using `res.pipe` would result in the response data being written to the file, but using `createWriteStream(dest)` would create a new file with the response data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createWriteStream(dest)` is a method that creates a new write stream to the file specified by `dest`, whereas `createWriteStream(dest)` is a method that creates a new write stream to the file specified by `dest` and also sets the file mode to `0666`. Using `fs.createWriteStream(dest)` would create a new file with the response data, but using `createWriteStream(dest
