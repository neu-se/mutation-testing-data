  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality instead of equality, which could result in a different outcome in the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `targetBasePath` is null or undefined, which could result in a different outcome in the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!targetBasePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `targetBasePath` is falsy, which could result in a different outcome in the `if` statement.

DONE.
