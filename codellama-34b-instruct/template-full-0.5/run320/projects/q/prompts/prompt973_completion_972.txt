  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when `npost` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when `npost` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would be called instead of `Q`, and it would not have the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
