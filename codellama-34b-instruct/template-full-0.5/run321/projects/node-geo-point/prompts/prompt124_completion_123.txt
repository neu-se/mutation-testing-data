  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments would be reversed, which could potentially affect the outcome of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with the latitude and longitude of the current object, rather than with a separate point object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude, this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because a new GeoPoint object would be created with the latitude and longitude of the current object, which could potentially affect the outcome of the method.

DONE.
