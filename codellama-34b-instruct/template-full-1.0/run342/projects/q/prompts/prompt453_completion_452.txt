  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.pop()` removes the last element from the array, while `unhandledReasons.push()` adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a literal value that does not refer to any variable, object property, or function. It will cause a `TypeError` exception to be thrown when `push()` is called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a literal value that represents the number zero. It will be coerced to the string `'0'` when `push()` is called on it, resulting in a different element being added to the array.

DONE.
