  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.concat()` is a method that merges two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.slice()` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

DONE.
