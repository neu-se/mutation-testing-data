  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `dispatch` method without the first element, which could cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `dispatch` method twice, which could cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `dispatch` method in reverse order, which could cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
