 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return `undefined` instead of rejecting the promise with an error when there's no more value to get from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop when there's no more value to get from the queue. The `get` method would keep calling itself recursively, causing a stack overflow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to immediately resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of rejecting it with an error when there's no more value to get from the queue.

DONE.
