  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called for the given promise, leading to an incorrect state of the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with an invalid index, leading to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with an incorrect index, leading to an incorrect state of the `unhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` arrays.

DONE.
