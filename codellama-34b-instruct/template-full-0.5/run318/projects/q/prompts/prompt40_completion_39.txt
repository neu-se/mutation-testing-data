  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that repeatedly calls a given function with a fixed time delay between each call, whereas `setTimeout` is a function that calls a given function after a fixed delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that queues a function to be called asynchronously as soon as possible, whereas `setTimeout` is a function that calls a given function after a fixed delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` is a function that cancels a timeout previously set with `setTimeout`, whereas `setTimeout` is a function that calls a given function after a fixed delay.

DONE.
