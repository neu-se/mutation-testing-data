  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would not be called when there are fewer than 2 arguments, which would cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would only be called when there are exactly 2 arguments, which would cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected for any other number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called when there are any number of arguments, including 0, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected even if there are no arguments.

DONE.
