  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `next` returns the next element and advances the iterator. This change would cause the code to retain the wrong number of elements in the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(2)` advances the iterator by two elements, whereas `next()` advances it by one element. This change would cause the code to skip over every other element in the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the element that `peek` would return, whereas `next` returns the element itself. This change would cause the code to retain the wrong number of elements in the `delta` array.
