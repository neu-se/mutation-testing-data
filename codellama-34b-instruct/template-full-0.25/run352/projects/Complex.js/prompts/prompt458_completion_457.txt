  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the number is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `isInfinite` would return true if the number is not infinite, while the original code would return true if the number is infinite.

DONE.
