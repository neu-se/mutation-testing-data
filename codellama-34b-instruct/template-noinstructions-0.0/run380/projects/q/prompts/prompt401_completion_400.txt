  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { throw reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified reason, rather than resolved with the value returned by the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function () { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the specified reason, rather than rejected with the value returned by the callback.
