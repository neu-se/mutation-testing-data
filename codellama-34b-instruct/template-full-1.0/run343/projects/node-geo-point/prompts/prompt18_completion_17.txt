  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject(object) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is replaced with a strict comparison, which would return `true` if the argument is not an object, and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('prototype')
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would need to have a `prototype` property in order to be considered an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would need to be an instance of the `Object` constructor in order to be considered an object.

DONE.
