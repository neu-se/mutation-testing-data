  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is not exactly equal to `true`. This change would cause the callback to be invoked with a different value in the `err` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is exactly equal to `true`. This change would cause the callback to be invoked with a different value in the `err` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy, while this replacement checks if it is exactly equal to `false`. This change would cause the callback to be invoked with a different value in the `err` parameter.
