  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
empty
```
This would result in different behavior because `empty` is not a promise and therefore `dispatch` cannot be called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise and therefore `dispatch` cannot be called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a promise and therefore `dispatch` cannot be called on it.

DONE.
