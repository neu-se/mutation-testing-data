  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both operands are infinite, while this code checks if either operand is infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` in more cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both operands are infinite, while this code checks if the first operand is infinite and the second operand is not infinite. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['NAN']` in fewer cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both operands are infinite, while this code checks if the first operand is
