  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds the new op to the end of the `ops` array, while `unshift` adds it to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds the new op to the beginning of the `ops` array, while `unshift` adds it to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds the new op to the beginning of the `ops` array, while `push` adds it to the end.

DONE.
