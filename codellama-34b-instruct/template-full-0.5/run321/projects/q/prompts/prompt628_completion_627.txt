  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument is missing, which could cause the `set` method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `null` argument would cause the `set` method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is different from the original value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
