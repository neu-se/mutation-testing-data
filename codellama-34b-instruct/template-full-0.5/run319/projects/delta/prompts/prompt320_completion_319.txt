  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of an operation is a string, whereas the `retain` property is a number. Using `insert` instead of `retain` would cause the code to treat the operation as an insertion, rather than a retention.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of an operation is a number, whereas the `retain` property is a number. Using `delete` instead of `retain` would cause the code to treat the operation as a deletion, rather than a retention.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property of an operation is an object, whereas the `retain` property is a number. Using `attributes` instead of `retain` would cause the code to treat the operation as an attribute change, rather than
