 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the current working directory, which might not have the required read permissions for the `src` directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./'
