  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` is a tuple syntax for a multiple assignment, whereas `a+b` is an addition operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` is a tuple syntax for a multiple assignment, whereas `a-b` is a subtraction operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` is a tuple syntax for a multiple assignment, whereas `b+a` is an addition operation with the variables reversed.

DONE.
