  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(input * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is being replaced with a simple negation, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(input + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is being replaced with an addition operation, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(input - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is being replaced with a subtraction operation, which would result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
