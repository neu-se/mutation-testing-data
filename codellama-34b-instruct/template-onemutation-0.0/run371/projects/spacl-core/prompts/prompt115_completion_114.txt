  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself. In the original code, the `for...of` loop iterates over the keys in the `verbs` object, but with the mutated code, the loop would iterate over the array of keys, which could potentially lead to different behavior.

DONE.
