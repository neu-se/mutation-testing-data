  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to get the value associated with the key `null`, which is not the same as getting the value associated with the key `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to get the value associated with the key `undefined`, which is not the same as getting the value associated with the key `key`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to get the value associated with the key `'keykey'`, which is not the same as getting the value associated with the key `key`.

DONE.
