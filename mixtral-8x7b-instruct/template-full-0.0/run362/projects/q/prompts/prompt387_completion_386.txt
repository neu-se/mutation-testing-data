 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback.fcall()` now returns an empty array instead of the original value, causing the `thenResolve` method to resolve the promise with an empty array instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall()` now returns a resolved promise instead of the original value, causing the `thenResolve` method to resolve the promise with a promise object instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall()` now returns undefined instead of the original value, causing the `thenResolve` method to resolve the promise with undefined instead of the original value.

DONE.
