  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` function immediately, instead of passing it as a parameter to `runSingle`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `task` function, instead of passing it as a parameter to `runSingle`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `task` function immediately, instead of passing it as a parameter to `runSingle`.

DONE.
