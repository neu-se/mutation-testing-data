  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array and would cause the `array_slice` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array and would cause the `array_slice` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would cause the `array_slice` function to return an empty array, which would not include the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
