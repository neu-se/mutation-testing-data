  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the first element of the exception object, which may not be a valid operation and could result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the string "object" if the exception is an object, but the original code fragment would return the actual object or arrow function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the message property of the exception object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
