  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the `tz.d` value would cause the `dstOffset` to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the `tz.d` value would cause the `dstOffset` to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the `tz.d` value would cause the `dstOffset` to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
