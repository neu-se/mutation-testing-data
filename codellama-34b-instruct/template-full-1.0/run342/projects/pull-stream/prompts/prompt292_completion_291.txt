  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return a different value when given the same input, as it would not pass through the item if it was seen for the second time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return a different value when given a null input, as it would not pass through the item if it was null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return a different value when given an input with a different length, as it would not pass through the item if it was seen for the second time.

DONE.
