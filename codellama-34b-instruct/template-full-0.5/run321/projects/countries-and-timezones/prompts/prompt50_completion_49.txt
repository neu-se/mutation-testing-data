  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the function `getTimezone` calls `memoizeTimezone` which calls `getTimezone` again, creating a recursive loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, whereas the original code only returns non-deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones for a given country, including deprecated ones, whereas the original code only returns non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
