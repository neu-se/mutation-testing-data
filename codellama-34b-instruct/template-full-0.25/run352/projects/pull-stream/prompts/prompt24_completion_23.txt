  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]` instead of `ref[1]`. This could cause the function to behave differently, especially if the function is expecting a specific value in the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[3]` instead of `ref[1]`. This could cause the function to behave differently, especially if the function is expecting a specific value in the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[4]` instead of `ref[1]`. This could cause the function to behave differently, especially if the function is expecting a specific value in the fourth argument.

DONE.
