  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always negate the imaginary part, whereas the original code only negated it if plus was odd.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'+'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the imaginary part, whereas the original code only added it if plus was odd.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the imaginary part as-is, whereas the original code only used it if plus was odd.

DONE.
