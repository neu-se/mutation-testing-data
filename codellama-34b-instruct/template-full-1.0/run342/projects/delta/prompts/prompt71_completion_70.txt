  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>(attributes)).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `attributes` to be an object with a `.length` property, but the replaced code would treat `attributes` as an array instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!<PLACEHOLDER>(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `attributes` to be an object with a `.length` property, but the replaced code would check if `attributes` is falsy instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
|| <PLACEHOLDER>(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `attributes` to be an object with a `.length` property, but the replaced code would check if `attributes` is falsy or not an object instead.

DONE.
