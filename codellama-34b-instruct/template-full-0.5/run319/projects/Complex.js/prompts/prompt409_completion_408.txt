  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause incorrect calculations in the subsequent lines of code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the imaginary part of the complex number to a temporary variable, which could cause incorrect calculations in the subsequent lines of code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause incorrect calculations in the subsequent lines of code.

DONE.
