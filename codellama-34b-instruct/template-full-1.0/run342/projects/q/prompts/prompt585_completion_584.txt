  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new promise callback that could potentially change the outcome of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.catch(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new promise error callback that could potentially change the outcome of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.cancellable()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new cancellable promise that could potentially change the outcome of the code.

DONE.
