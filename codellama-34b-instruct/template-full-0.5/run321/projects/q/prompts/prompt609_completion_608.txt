  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the provided arguments, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the provided arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise with the provided arguments, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the provided arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the provided arguments, whereas `deferred.resolve(op, args)` would resolve the promise with the result of calling `op` with `args`.

DONE.
