  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return void;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the value of `Q`, which is a promise library, but the modified code would return `undefined`. This could cause any code that depends on the return value of `Q` to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a promise that would be rejected with the provided error message, but the modified code would throw an unhandled error. This could cause the application to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "Hello, world!";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a promise, but the modified code would return a string. This could cause any code that depends on the return value of `Q` to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
