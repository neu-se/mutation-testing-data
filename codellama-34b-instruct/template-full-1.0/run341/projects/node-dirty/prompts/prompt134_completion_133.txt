  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row.key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `row` is an object with a `key` property, and `this._data.delete(row.key)` would always delete the same key, regardless of whether the row is valid or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(row);
```
This would result in different behavior because `row` is an object with a `key` property, and `this._data.delete(row)` would delete the entire row, regardless of whether the key is valid or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.clear()` would delete all the rows in the database, regardless of whether they are valid or not.

DONE.
