 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w => w.slice(0, -1) + 'xes'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends 'xes' instead of 'es' to words ending with 'x', 'ch', or 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return window.w + 'es' }
