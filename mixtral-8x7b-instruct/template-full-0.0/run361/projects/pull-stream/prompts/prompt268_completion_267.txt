 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not giving the callback a chance to execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'Error: This should have been an array')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string instead of an array or an error to the callback, which might not be handled correctly by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `_read` variable to `null` before the next chunk is processed, potentially causing the stream to stop processing data prematurely.

DONE.
