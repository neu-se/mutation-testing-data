  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is a function, and adding 1 to a function would return a new function, which would likely cause the program to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying a function by 2 would return a new function, which would likely produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling the `read` function with the argument `1` would return a new value, which would likely cause the program to fail.

DONE.
