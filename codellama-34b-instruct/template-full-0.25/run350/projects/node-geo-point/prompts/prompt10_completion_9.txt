  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and `call` allows us to call it with a different `this` value. In this case, we are calling it with `point` as the `this` value, which means that it will return `true` if `point` has a property called `coordinates`, regardless of whether it is an own property or inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it is checking if `point` has an own property called `coordinates`, rather than checking if it has a property called `coordinates` in its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different
