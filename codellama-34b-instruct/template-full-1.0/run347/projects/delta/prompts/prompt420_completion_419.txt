  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest positive number, but `NaN` is not a number and would cause the `BigInt` constructor to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest positive number, but `Infinity` is not a number and would cause the `BigInt` constructor to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min` returns the smallest positive number, but `"hello"` is a string and would cause the `BigInt` constructor to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
