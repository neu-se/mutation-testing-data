  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, and the function will not be called correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not properly escaped, and the function will not be called correctly.
