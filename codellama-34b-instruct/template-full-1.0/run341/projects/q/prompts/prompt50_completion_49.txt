  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `!flushing` would invert the boolean value, while `flushing` would maintain the same boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!flushing` would invert the boolean value, while `true` would always be `true`, making the condition always pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing != true
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` would always be `true`, while `true` is a constant, so the condition would always be `false`.

DONE.
