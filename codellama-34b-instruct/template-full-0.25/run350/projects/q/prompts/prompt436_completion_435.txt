  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the array contains the given element, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the element is at the given index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise in unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `in` checks if the property exists in the object, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the element is at the given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks if the element is at the given index, whereas `array_indexOf` checks if the element is at the given index.

DONE.
