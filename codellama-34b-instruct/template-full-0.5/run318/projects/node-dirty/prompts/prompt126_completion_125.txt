  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_error` event would be emitted instead of `write_close`, which could cause the application to behave differently in the case of a write error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_error` event would be emitted instead of `write_close`, which could cause the application to behave differently in the case of a read error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain_error` event would be emitted instead of `write_close`, which could cause the application to behave differently in the case of a drain error.

DONE.
