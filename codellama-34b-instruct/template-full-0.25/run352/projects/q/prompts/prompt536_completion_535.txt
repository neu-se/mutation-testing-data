  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `spread` method to reject the promise with the rejection reason, rather than fulfilling it with the array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a fulfilled promise, which would cause the `spread` method to fulfill the promise with the array of values, rather than rejecting it with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred promise, which would cause the `spread` method to wait for the promise to be resolved or rejected, rather than fulfilling it with the array of values.

DONE.
