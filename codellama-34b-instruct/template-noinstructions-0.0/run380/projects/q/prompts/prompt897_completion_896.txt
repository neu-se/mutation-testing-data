  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(error);`, which would reject the promise with the `error` object, while the new code fragment would reject the promise with the `deferred.reject` function itself, which is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(error);`, which would reject the promise with the `error` object, while the new code fragment would resolve the promise with the `deferred.reject` function itself, which is not an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject(error);`, which would
