 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an "index out of bounds" error when trying to access a rule that doesn't exist, instead of iterating through all the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== rules.length
