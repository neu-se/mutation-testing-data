  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the state is not "fulfilled", but not "rejected".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the state is not "rejected", but not "fulfilled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the state is not "pending", but not "fulfilled" or "rejected".

DONE.
