  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `replacer` function instead of the `reviver` function, which could lead to different results when parsing the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `reviver` function instead of the `options.reviver` function, which could lead to different results when parsing the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `reviver` function as both the `reviver` and `replacer` functions, which could lead to different results when parsing the JSON data.

DONE.
