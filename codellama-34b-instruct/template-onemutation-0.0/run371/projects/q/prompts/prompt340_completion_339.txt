  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` property would always be "fulfilled", regardless of the promise's actual state, which would cause the `then` method to always return a fulfilled promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
