  Thank you for providing the code. I will now proceed with mutation testing to identify weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 resolver.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver.reject()` will reject the promise instead of resolving it, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in the tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve()` is a function that resolves the promise, but it is not part of the current scope. It would cause a ReferenceError, which would potentially make the code fail to function altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` is a reference to the resolve function of the promise, but it is not associated with the current promise. It would cause the code to resolve the promise prematurely, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors in the tests.
