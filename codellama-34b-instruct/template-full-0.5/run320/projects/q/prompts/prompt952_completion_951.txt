  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object in JavaScript that contains the arguments passed to a function, while `arguments[0]` is just the first argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` creates a new array containing the elements of `arguments`, while `arguments` itself is not an array and does not have a `slice` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, [].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(arguments)` creates a new array containing the elements of `arguments`, while `arguments` itself is not an array and does not have a `slice` method.

DONE.
