 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolver` is an instance of `Function` constructor, which is not the same as checking if it's a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(resolver) === '[object Function]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `toString` method to check if `resolver` is a function, which might not be reliable in all environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof resolver
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator to check if `resolver` is a function, but it's less strict than the original condition and might not catch some edge cases.

DONE.
