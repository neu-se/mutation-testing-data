Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to add the length of the `insert` property instead of subtracting the `delete` property, which would incorrectly increase the length instead of decreasing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the `delete` property altogether, leading to an incorrect calculation of the length as it would always return the same value regardless of the actual operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `retain` property instead of `delete`, which could lead to an incorrect increase in length when the intention was to decrease it based on deletions.

DONE.
