  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(otherOp.attributes, thisOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `diff` method of `AttributeMap` to compare the attributes of the two operations, rather than the `invert` method used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `invert` method of `AttributeMap` to compare the attributes of the two operations, rather than the `diff` method used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `compose` method of `AttributeMap` to combine the attributes of the two operations, rather than the `diff` or `invert` methods used in the original code.
