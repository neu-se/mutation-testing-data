  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `otherIter` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the `thisIter` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `peek()` method on the `otherIter` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
