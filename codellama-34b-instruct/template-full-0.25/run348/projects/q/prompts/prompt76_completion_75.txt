  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with the value `0`, while this code sends a message with the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with the value `0`, while this code sends a message with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sends a message with the value `0`, while this code sends a message with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
