  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different modulo operation, which would cause a different result to be concatenated with the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + (minus % 2 ? '-' : '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different order of operations, which would cause the character to be added to the string before the modulo operation is performed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(minus % 2) + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different mathematical operation, which would cause a different result to be concatenated with the string.

DONE.
