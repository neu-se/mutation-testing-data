  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy throw.")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error and would simply pass the value to the next callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the value to the next callback, whereas the replaced fragment would pass null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the value to the next callback, whereas the replaced fragment would pass undefined.

DONE.
