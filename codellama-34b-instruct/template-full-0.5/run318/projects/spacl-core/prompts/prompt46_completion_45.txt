  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/.+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regex with a more specific pattern, while this replacement uses a less specific pattern that would match more strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/.*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regex with a more specific pattern, while this replacement uses a less specific pattern that would match more strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^.+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regex with a more specific pattern, while this replacement uses a less specific pattern that would match more strings.

DONE.
