 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` constant would always result in a bearing of approximately 90 degrees, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random bearing value between 0 and 360 degrees, which may not reflect the actual direction to the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value of the current object as the bearing, which is not related to the actual direction to the destination point.

DONE.
