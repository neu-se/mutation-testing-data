  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in this version, the slice method would start from the previous index, which could be the wrong index if the slice method is called with a different offset. For example, if the offset is 0, the slice method would return an empty string, instead of the first character of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in this version, the slice method would start two characters after the given offset, which could be the wrong index if the slice method is called with a different offset. For example, if the offset is 0, the slice method would return the second and third characters of the original string, instead of the first and second characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because in this version, the slice method would start from the given offset plus the number of characters in the
