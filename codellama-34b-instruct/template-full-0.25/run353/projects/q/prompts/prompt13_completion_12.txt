  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk()` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is a negation of the `ses.ok()` function, which returns `true` if the current context is secure and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isNotOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isNotOk()` is a function that always returns `false`, whereas `!ses.ok()` is a negation of the `ses.ok()` function, which returns `true` if the current context is secure and `false` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.isSecure()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.isSecure()` is a function that returns `true` if the current context is secure and `false` otherwise, whereas `
