  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` returns a shallow copy of the array, which would cause the `fail` method to be called with a different array than the one that was passed to `nfcall`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([])` returns a new array that contains the same elements as `nodeArgs`, but it does not modify the original array. This means that the `fail` method would be called with a different array than the one that was passed to `nfcall`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 0, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(0, 0, null)` inserts a `null` value at the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `fail` method to be
