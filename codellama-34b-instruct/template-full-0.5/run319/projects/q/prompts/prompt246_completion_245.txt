  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set only if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false` or `hasStacks` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set only if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true` and `hasStacks` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set only if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true` or `hasStacks` is `false`.

DONE.
