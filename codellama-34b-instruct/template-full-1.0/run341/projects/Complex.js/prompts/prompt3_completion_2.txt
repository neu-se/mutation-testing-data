  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(x)` is not the same as `sin(x)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(x)` is not the same as `exp(x)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log1p
```
This would result in different behavior because `log1p(x)` is not the same as `exp(x)`.

DONE.
