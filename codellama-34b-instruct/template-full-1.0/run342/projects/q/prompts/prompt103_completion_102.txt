  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be off by one, leading to the wrong value being used in the reduction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be incremented by one, leading to incorrect results in the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index would be off by two, leading to the wrong value being used in the reduction.

DONE.
