  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Can't get value from closed queue");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `closed` property is `true`, while this replacement throws an error regardless of the value of `closed`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the `closed` property is `true`, while this replacement rejects the promise regardless of the value of `closed`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the `closed` property is `true`, while this replacement resolves the promise regardless of the value of `closed`.

DONE.
