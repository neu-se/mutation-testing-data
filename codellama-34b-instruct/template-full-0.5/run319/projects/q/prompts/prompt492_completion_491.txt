  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it does not have a `rejected` property. In the original code, `this` refers to the `promise` object, which has a `rejected` property that is set to `true` when the promise is rejected. By replacing `this` with `null`, the `rejected` property is not set, and the `untrackRejection` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it does not have a `rejected` property. In the original code, `this` refers to the `promise` object, which has a `rejected` property that is set to `true` when the promise is rejected. By replacing `this` with `undefined`, the `rejected` property is not set, and the `untrackRejection` function will not be called.
