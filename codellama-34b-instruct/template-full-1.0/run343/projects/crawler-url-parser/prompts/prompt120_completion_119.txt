  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl, baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to access a different property (pageurl) than the original (currentUrl).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(<PLACEHOLDER>, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to call itself recursively, which would eventually lead to a stack overflow.

DONE.
