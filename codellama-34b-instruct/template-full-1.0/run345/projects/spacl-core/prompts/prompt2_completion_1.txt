  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a different method than `match`, and may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of strings, whereas `match` returns a `RegExpMatchArray` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the length of the string, whereas `match` returns a `RegExpMatchArray` object.

DONE.
