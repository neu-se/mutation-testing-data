  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `attempt3` array, which is the string `"function@filename:lineNumber"`, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the `attempt3` array, which is the string `"filename:lineNumber"`, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fourth element of the `attempt3` array, which is the string `"lineNumber"`, instead of the second element, which is the line number.

DONE.
