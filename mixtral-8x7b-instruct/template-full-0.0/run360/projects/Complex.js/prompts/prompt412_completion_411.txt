 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is the abstract equality operator, which can compare different types. In this case, it might not raise an error when comparing a complex number with a number, while the original code only passes when the imaginary part is exactly 0 (a number).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is undefined, not necessarily 0. This could lead to unexpected results or errors when working with complex numbers that have an actual imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.im === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the property of the current object, instead of the local variable `b`. This could lead to unexpected results or errors when working with complex numbers that have an actual imaginary part, especially if the object has other properties or methods.

DONE.
