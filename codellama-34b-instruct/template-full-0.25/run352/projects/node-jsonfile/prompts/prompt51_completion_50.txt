  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra newline character at the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the `stringify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + EOL + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add two extra newline characters at the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the `stringify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + EOL + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' at the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the `stringify` function.

DONE.
