  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` will resolve the promise, whereas `deferred.reject` will reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` will refer to the global object, whereas `callback` refers to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` will result in a rejected promise, whereas `callback` refers to a function that will be called to resolve the promise.

DONE.
