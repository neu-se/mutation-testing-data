  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `newline` character to be inserted at a different position in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `newline` character to be inserted at a different position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `newline` character to be inserted at a different position in the string.

DONE.
