  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the point object has both type and coordinates properties, while the modified code fragment checks if the point object has neither type nor coordinates properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the point object has both type and coordinates properties, while the modified code fragment checks if the point object has type but not coordinates properties.
