  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `verbs` except the first one, whereas `verbs` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.concat(["newVerb"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.concat(["newVerb"])` would return a new array containing all elements of `verbs` plus the new verb "newVerb", whereas `verbs` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(verb => verb !== "deniedVerb")
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.filter(verb => verb !== "deniedVerb")` would return a new array containing all elements of `verbs` except the verb "deniedVerb", whereas `verbs` would return the original
