  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different object than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - tzs[key]
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different object than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * tzs[key]
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different object than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

DONE.
