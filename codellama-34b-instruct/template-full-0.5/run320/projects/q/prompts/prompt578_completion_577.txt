  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "throw" verb would cause the generator to throw an error, rather than calling the "next" verb, which would cause the generator to continue to the next iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" verb would cause the generator to return a value, rather than calling the "next" verb, which would cause the generator to continue to the next iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "yield" verb would cause the generator to yield a value, rather than calling the "next" verb, which would cause the generator to continue to the next iteration.

DONE.
