  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() != otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean value, which when negated with `!` would result in a different value than the actual value returned by the original `hasNext()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() === otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean value, which when compared with `===` to the result of `hasNext()` from another iterator would result in a different value than the actual value returned by the original `hasNext()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() + otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean value, which when added to the result of `hasNext()` from another iterator would result in a different value than the actual value returned by the original `
