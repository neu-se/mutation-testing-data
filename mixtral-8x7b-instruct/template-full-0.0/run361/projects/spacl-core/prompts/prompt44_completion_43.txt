 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
min = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a minimum occurrence of 1, while the original code does not change the minimum when adding a new part. This could lead to unexpected matches or failures in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
min = max = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets both minimum and maximum occurrences to 1, while the original code only sets the minimum to 1. This could lead to different matches or failures in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty string to the parts array, which is not the same as adding a new part based on the input string. This could lead to unexpected matches or failures in the test suite.

DONE.
