  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria');
```
This would result in different behavior because the input word 'bacterium' would not match any of the existing rules, so it would be added to the end of the array, and the function would return 'bacteria' instead of 'bacterium', which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return 'bacteri' instead of 'bacteria', which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacteria', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'um' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now return 'bacterium' instead of 'bacteria
