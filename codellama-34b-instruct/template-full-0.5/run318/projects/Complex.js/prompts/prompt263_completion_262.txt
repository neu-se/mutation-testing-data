  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is the tangent function, while `Math.atan2` is the arctangent function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the sine function, while `Math.atan2` is the arctangent function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the cosine function, while `Math.atan2` is the arctangent function.

DONE.
