  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the zip file would be created in the current working directory instead of in the directory specified by the `targetFilePath` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
    0: false,
    1: true,
    2: false,
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` function would only consider the first element of the `targetFilePath` parameter, instead of all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` function would throw an error if the `targetFilePath` parameter is undefined.

DONE.
