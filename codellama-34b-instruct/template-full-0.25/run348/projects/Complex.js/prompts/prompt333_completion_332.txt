  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to -1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to -1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to -1, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is greater than -1.

DONE.
