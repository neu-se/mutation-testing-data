  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `object` variable, potentially causing the `isFulfilled` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would attempt to add the value `1` to the `object` variable, potentially causing a type error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `object` variable, potentially causing a type error or unexpected behavior if the variable is not an array or string.

DONE.
