  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `master` function would return a promise that resolves to `undefined`, rather than the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `master` function would return a promise that resolves to `null`, rather than the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `master` function would return a promise that resolves to an empty object, rather than the original object.

DONE.
