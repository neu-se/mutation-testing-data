  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the first two elements from the array instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the last element from the array instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the last element from the array instead of just the first one.

DONE.
