  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `while` loop condition always true, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `while` loop condition always false, causing the loop to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the `otherIter` iterator, causing the loop to iterate over twice as many elements.

DONE.
