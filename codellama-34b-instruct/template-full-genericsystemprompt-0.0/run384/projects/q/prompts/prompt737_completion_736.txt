  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the promises array cannot be less than 0, so the code would never execute the `onRejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always execute the `onRejected` function, even if the promises array is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only execute the `onRejected` function if the promises array has exactly one element.

DONE.
