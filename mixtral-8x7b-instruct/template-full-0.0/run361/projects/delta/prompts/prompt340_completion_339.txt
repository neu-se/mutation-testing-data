 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation in the base delta instead of the index of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1 or 0 instead of the correct index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIter.next().attributes ? 1 : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the attributes of the next operation instead of the index.

DONE.
