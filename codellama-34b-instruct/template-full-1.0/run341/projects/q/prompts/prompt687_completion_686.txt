  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return a new array containing all elements from `arguments` except for the first, whereas `arguments, 1` would return only the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)` would return a new array containing all elements from `arguments` starting from the second, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would only return the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { return arguments.slice(1); })(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a new array containing all elements from `arguments` starting from the second, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would only return the second element.
