Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `prop` with `null` would cause the `map` function to be `null`, leading to a runtime error when attempting to call `map(data, ...)`, as `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `prop` with a function that returns `undefined` would cause the `map` function to always return `undefined`, which would lead to unexpected results in the callback, as the data being processed would not be transformed as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return data + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `prop` with a function that increments the data by 1 would change the output of the mapping process, potentially leading to incorrect results if the original intention was to simply pass the data through unchanged.

DONE.
