  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return the wrong line number for the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return the wrong column number for the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return the wrong function name for the stack trace.

DONE.
