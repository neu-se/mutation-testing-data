  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be parsed with `slashesDenoteHost` and `host` set to `true`, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method to interpret the `baseUrlStr` as a hostname, rather than a URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method to use the current URL as the base URL, rather than the `baseUrlStr` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be parsed with `slashesDenoteHost` set to `true`, but `host` set to `false`, which would cause the `URL.parse()` method
