  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert === otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the references of the `insert` properties instead of their values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.valueOf() === otherOp.insert.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of the `insert` properties instead of their references.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(thisOp.insert) === JSON.stringify(otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the stringified versions of the `insert` properties instead of their references.

DONE.
