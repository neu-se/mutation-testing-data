Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
id === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add modules to `alreadyImportedModules` when the `id` is `null`, instead of when it's not `null`, effectively changing the condition for tracking imported modules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof id === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add modules to `alreadyImportedModules` when the `id` is a string, instead of when it's not `null`, which could lead to incorrect tracking of imported modules if `id` can be other types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add modules to `alreadyImportedModules`, regardless of the value of `id`, effectively preventing any modules from being imported multiple times, but potentially causing issues if modules with different media queries are intended to be imported multiple times.

DONE.
