  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the current index of the loop instead of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be adding the first and second arguments instead of just using the first argument.

DONE.
