  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {
  throw new Error('Failed to load data');
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `_load` method, which would load the data from the file, while the modified code fragment would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {
  this._data = new Map();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would load the data from the file, while the modified code fragment would create a new empty map and assign it to `_data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => {
  this._data = null;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would load the data from the file, while the modified code fragment would assign `null` to `_data`.

DONE.
