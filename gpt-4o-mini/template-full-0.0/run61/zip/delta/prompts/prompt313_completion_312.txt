Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the `delete` property instead of the `insert` property, which would lead to incorrect handling of operations that are meant to be inserted, potentially causing data loss or incorrect diffs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the `retain` property instead of the `insert` property, which would cause the logic to incorrectly process retain operations as if they were insert operations, leading to unexpected results in the diffing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `insert` is `undefined` rather than checking if it exists, which would cause the code to treat valid insert operations as non-existent, leading to erroneous error handling and potentially throwing exceptions incorrectly.

DONE.
