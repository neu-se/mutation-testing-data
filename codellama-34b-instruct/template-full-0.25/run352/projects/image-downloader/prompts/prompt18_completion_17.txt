  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the unencoded basename instead of the decoded basename, which could result in a different file name being used for the destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the basename of the destination path instead of the decoded basename of the URL, which could result in a different file name being used for the destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the directory name of the destination path instead of the decoded basename of the URL, which could result in a different file name being used for the destination.

DONE.
