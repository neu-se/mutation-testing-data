  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"action"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "action" is not the same as the variable `verb`, which is a parameter passed to the `Policy.query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the `verb` variable, which may not be the same as the original behavior of the `Policy.query()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + "action"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `verb` variable with the string "action", which may not be the same as the original behavior of the `Policy.query()` method.

DONE.
