  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is not defined in the original code, and the `function () {}` is not the same as the original `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is not defined in the original code, and the `function () {}` is not the same as the original `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is not defined in the original code, and `null` is not the same as the original `cb` function.

DONE.
