  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/[^:]+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for a colon followed by one or more characters, whereas the new code fragment is looking for one or more characters that are not colons.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!part.match(/:.+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the string contains a colon followed by one or more characters, whereas the new code fragment is checking if the string does not contain a colon followed by one or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is looking for a colon followed by zero or more characters until the end of the string, whereas the new code fragment is looking for a colon followed by one or more characters until the end of the string.

DONE.
