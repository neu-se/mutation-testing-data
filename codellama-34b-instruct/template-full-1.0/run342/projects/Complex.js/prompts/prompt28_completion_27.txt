  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(0)` is 0, whereas `0` is 0, so the resulting value would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(1)` is 1, whereas `1` is 1, so the resulting value would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(Infinity)` is `undefined`, whereas `Infinity` is `Infinity`, so the resulting value would be different.

DONE.
