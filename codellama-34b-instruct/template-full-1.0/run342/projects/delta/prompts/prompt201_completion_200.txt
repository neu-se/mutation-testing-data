  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta([newOp]).concat(rest).chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Delta object with the newOp and then concatenate it with the rest of the ops, rather than pushing the newOp onto the end of the existing Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(new Delta([newOp])).chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Delta object with the newOp and then concatenate it with the existing Delta object, rather than pushing the newOp onto the end of the existing Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta([...thisIter.rest(), newOp]).chop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Delta object with the remaining ops and the newOp, rather than pushing the newOp onto the end of the existing Delta object.

DONE
