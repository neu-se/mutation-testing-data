  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0 || b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are zero, while this new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both zero, while this new code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0 || b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` and `b` are both zero, while this new code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is negative.

DONE.
