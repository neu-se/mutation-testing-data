  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because if `abort` is `true`, it would return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` instead of `cb(true)`, which would cause the function to enter a different code path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because if `abort` is `true`, it would return `abortCb(cb, false, onAbort)` instead of `cb(true)`, which would cause the function to enter a different code path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because if `abort` is `true`, it would return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` instead of `cb(true)`, which would cause the function to enter a different code path.

DONE.
