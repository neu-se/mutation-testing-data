  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(Object.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` is a custom function that creates a new object with the specified prototype, whereas `Object.create` is a built-in function that creates a new object with the specified prototype. Using `Object.create` instead of `object_create` would cause the code to use the built-in function instead of the custom one, which could potentially break the code if it relies on the custom behavior of `object_create`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` with a null prototype creates a new object that does not inherit from the Object prototype, whereas `object_create` with a null prototype creates a new object that inherits from the Object prototype. Using `Object.create(null)` instead of `object_create` could potentially break the code if it relies on the Object prototype being available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
