  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi']` is a different property than `a['arg']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['re']` is a different property than `a['arg']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['im']` is a different property than `a['arg']`.

DONE.
