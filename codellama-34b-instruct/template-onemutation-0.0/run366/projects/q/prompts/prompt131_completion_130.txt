  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.toString)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a different function than `uncurryThis`, and it would cause the `object_toString` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause a different exception to be thrown.

DONE.
