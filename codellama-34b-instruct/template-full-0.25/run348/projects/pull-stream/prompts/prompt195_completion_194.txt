  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return a reference to the `aborted` variable, while the new code fragment `null` would return a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return a reference to the `aborted` variable, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` would return a reference to the `aborted` variable, while the new code fragment `false` would return a boolean false value.

DONE.
