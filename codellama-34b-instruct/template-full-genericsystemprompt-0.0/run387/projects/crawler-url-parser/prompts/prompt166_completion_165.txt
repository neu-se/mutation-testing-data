  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference in the number of path parts is equal to -1, which means the link URL has one more path part than the page URL. However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `part_count_diff == 2`, the code would check if the difference in the number of path parts is equal to 2, which means the link URL has two more path parts than the page URL. This would result in a different classification of the link as "uplevel" instead of "internal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference in the number of path parts is equal to -1, which means the link URL has one more path part than the page URL. However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `part_count_diff > 1`, the code would check if the
