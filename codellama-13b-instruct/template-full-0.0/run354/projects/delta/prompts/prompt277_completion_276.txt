  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code fragment `iter.peek` returns the next element in the iterator and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method returns the next element in the iterator and advances the iterator, whereas the original code fragment `iter.peek` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek(2)` method returns the next two elements in the iterator without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code fragment `iter.peek` returns the next element in the iterator and advances the iterator.

DONE.
