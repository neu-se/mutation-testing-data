  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the base URL with "https" instead of "http", which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the base URL is not a valid HTTPS URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the base URL, which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the base URL is not a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the base URL with "ftp" instead of "http", which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the base URL is not a valid FTP URL.

DONE.
