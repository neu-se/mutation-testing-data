  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"some other value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor expects a valid path specification as the first argument, but providing a different value would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.startsWith("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor expects a path specification as the first argument, but providing a partial specification with a different prefix would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.endsWith("bar")
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor expects a path specification as the first argument, but providing a partial specification with a different suffix would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
