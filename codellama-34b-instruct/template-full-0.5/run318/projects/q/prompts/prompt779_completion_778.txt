  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a different method than `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` is a different method than `then`.

DONE.
