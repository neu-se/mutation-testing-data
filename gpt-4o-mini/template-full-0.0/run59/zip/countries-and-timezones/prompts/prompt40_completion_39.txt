Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev.concat({ [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array instead of merging objects, which would lead to an incorrect structure in the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(prev).map(key => ({ [key]: prev[key], [id]: getCountry(id, options) }));
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the existing object into an array of objects, rather than merging the new country into the existing object, which would change the expected output format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) });
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of modifying the existing `prev` object, which could lead to unexpected results if the caller expects the original object to be updated.

DONE.
