  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would not wait for all promises to be settled, and would instead resolve as soon as the first promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would not wait for all promises to be settled, and would instead resolve as soon as the first promise is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would not wait for all promises to be settled, and would instead resolve as soon as the first promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
