  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` array is now being accessed by its `length` property instead of directly. This could potentially cause issues if the `cbs` array is not defined or has a different structure than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `cbs` array is now being accessed directly instead of using the `length` property. This could potentially cause issues if the `cbs` array is not defined or has a different structure than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `cbs` array is now being accessed using the `slice` method instead of directly. This could potentially cause issues if the `cbs` array is not defined or has a different structure than expected.

DONE.
