  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isInfinite(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return `false`, regardless of whether the input is infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isFinite(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return `true`, regardless of whether the input is infinite or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.isInfinite(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return the opposite of what it should, i.e. it would return `true` for infinite inputs and `false` for finite inputs.

DONE.
