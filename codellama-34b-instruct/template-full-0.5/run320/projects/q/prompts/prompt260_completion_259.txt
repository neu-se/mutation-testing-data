  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would create a fulfilled promise with value `null`, which is different from the original `Q(value)` which creates a promise that is pending until `value` is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would create a fulfilled promise with value `undefined`, which is different from the original `Q(value)` which creates a promise that is pending until `value` is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(new Error("test"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject(new Error("test"))` would create a rejected promise with error "test", which is different from the original `Q(value)` which creates a promise that is pending until `value` is resolved.

DONE.
