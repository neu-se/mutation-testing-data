  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Injected error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error is injected into the promise chain, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("Injected rejection"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because a new rejection is injected into the promise chain, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "Injected value"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because a new value is injected into the promise chain, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the new value instead of the original value.

DONE.
