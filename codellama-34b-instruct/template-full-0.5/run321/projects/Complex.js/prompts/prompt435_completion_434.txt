  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(places)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` returns the sine of an angle, while `Math.pow()` returns the result of raising a number to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, while `10` is a literal value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(places)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.pow()` returns the result of raising a number to a power.

DONE.
