  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] > 1000 && a['phi'] < -Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the radius is greater than 1000 and the angle is less than -PI, instead of checking if the radius is not finite and the angle is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] > 0 && a['phi'] < -Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the radius is positive and the angle is less than -PI, instead of checking if the radius is not finite and the angle is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] < 0 && a['phi'] > Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the radius is negative and the angle is greater than PI, instead of checking if the radius is not finite and the angle is finite.

DONE.
