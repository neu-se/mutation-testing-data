Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise when there are still pending promises, leading to premature resolution instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve the promise when there is exactly one pending promise left, which could cause the function to wait indefinitely if there are multiple pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise as long as there is at least one pending promise, which is incorrect since it should only resolve when all promises have settled.

DONE.
