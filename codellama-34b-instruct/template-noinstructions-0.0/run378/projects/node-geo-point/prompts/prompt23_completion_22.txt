  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property, which could lead to incorrect results if the input object does not have a `longitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property, which could lead to incorrect results if the input object does not have a `latitude` property.
