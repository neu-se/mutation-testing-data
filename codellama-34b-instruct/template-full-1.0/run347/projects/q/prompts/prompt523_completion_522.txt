  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch.apply(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would be called with a different context, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch.call(object, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would be called with a different context, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is called on a different object, potentially leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
