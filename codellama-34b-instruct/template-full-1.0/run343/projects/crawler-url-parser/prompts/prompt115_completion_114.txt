  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` would iterate over the keys of the `Map` object, producing a new array with the same elements but in a different order than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.entries()` would return a new object with the same keys and values, but in a different order than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.reverse()` would return a new object with the same key-value pairs, but in reverse order of the original.

DONE.
