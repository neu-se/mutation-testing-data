  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = "something else";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `part` variable, which may be used later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `spec` string, which may affect the regular expression generated later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/')[-1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the `spec` string, which may not be the same as the `part` variable that was originally defined.

DONE.
