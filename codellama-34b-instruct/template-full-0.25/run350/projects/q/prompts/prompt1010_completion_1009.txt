  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs` is a different variable than `arguments`, and it would be sliced starting from the second element instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a different variable than `arguments` and `nodeArgs`, and it would be sliced starting from the second element instead of the first.

DONE.
