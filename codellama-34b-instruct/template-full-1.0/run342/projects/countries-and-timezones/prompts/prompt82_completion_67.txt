  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a different set of options, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getCountry(c, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with an empty object as the second argument, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c => getTimezone(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would be called instead of `getCountry`, which could potentially return a different result.

DONE.
