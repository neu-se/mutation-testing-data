  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined instead of returning a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null instead of returning a value.

DONE.
