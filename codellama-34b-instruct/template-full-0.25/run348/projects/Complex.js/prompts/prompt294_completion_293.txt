  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not the same as the `b` variable, and the `a` variable is not a valid argument for the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would produce a different result than the `b` expression, and the `cosh` function would produce a different result based on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function would produce a different result than the `cosh` function, and the `Math.cos` function would produce a different result based on the input.

DONE.
