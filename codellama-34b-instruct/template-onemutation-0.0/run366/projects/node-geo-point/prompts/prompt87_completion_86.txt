  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance, while the new code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of the angular distance. This would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
