  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'foo');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the string `'foo'` instead of the expected `'drain'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the number of in-flight writes instead of the expected `'drain'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the size of the queue instead of the expected `'drain'` event.

DONE.
