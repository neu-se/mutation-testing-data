Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.resolve(options.dest, decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.resolve` will create an absolute path based on the current working directory, which may lead to a different destination than intended, especially if `options.dest` is a relative path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + decodedBasename;
```
This would result in different behavior because using the `+` operator will concatenate the `options.dest` string with `decodedBasename`, which may not create a valid path and could lead to incorrect file handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest) + decodedBasename;
```
This would result in different behavior because this code will replace the destination with the basename of `options.dest` concatenated with `decodedBasename`, which would not preserve the intended directory structure and could lead to file overwrites or incorrect file paths.

DONE.
