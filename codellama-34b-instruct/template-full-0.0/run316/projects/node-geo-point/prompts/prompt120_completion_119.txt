  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance * 2, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing parameter is increased by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance, bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the destination point to be calculated in the wrong direction.

DONE.
