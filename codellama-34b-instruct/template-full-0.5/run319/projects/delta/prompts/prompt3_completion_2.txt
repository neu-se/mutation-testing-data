  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function is used to create a deep copy of an object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of a copy of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function is used to create a deep copy of an object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a copy of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function is used to create a deep copy of an object, but replacing it with an empty object `{}` would cause the function to return an empty object instead of a copy of the original object.

DONE.
