  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set in the `process.env` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG === "true"
```
This code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set to the string `"true"` in the `process.env` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG === true
```
This code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set to the boolean `true` in the `process.env` object.

DONE.
