  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + sourceUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would always evaluate to 1, regardless of the actual value of `sourceUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would always add 1 to the value of `sourceUrl`, regardless of the actual value of `sourceUrl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * sourceUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would always multiply the value of `sourceUrl` by 2, regardless of the actual value of `sourceUrl`.

DONE.
