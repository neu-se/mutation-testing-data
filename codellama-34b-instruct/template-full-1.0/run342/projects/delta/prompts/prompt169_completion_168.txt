  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on `thisIter`, which is an `OpIterator` instance, but the `next()` method is not defined for the `OpIterator` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on `otherIter`, which is also an `OpIterator` instance, but the `next()` method is not defined for the `OpIterator` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is returned instead of the expected `Op` object, which could lead to unexpected errors or behavior in the code that uses the `createDelta` method.

DONE.
