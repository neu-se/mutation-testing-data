 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'javascript:void(0)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed value for `embedBaseUrlStr`, which may not be correctly parsed by the `parse` function, causing unexpected results in the extracted URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `embedBaseUrlStr` to a boolean value, which would cause the `parse` function to throw an error when trying to access the `.attr()` method on a non-object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body').html()
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `embedBaseUrlStr` to the HTML content of the `<body>` element, which is not a valid URL and would cause the `parse` function to throw an error when trying to parse it.

DONE.
