  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 2) - a / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.cos` function to calculate the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment is using the `Math.sin` function to calculate the sine of `b`. This would cause the resulting complex number to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 2) - b / d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.cos` function to calculate the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment is using the `Math.sin` function to calculate the sine of `b`. This would cause the resulting complex number to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.PI / 2) - a / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `Math.cos`
