  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(row, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could result in different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(row)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could result in different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(row, null, 4)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could result in different output.

DONE.
