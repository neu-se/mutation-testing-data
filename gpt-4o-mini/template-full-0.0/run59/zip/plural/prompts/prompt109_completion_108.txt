Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w}
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `misc` array from the regex, meaning words that should match the pluralization rule (if they are in the `misc` array) will not be processed correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')es\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected plural suffix from 's' to 'es', which would incorrectly match words that do not follow this pluralization rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'g'), function(w) { return w}
```
This would result in different behavior because
