  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-z['re'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would change signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the number would be taken into account instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this["re"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the number would be taken from a different object property, which may have a different value.

DONE.
