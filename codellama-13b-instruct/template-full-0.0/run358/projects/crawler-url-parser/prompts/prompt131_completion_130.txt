  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\/(index|default)\.[a-z]+$/` matches both "index" and "default" at the end of the URL path, and the `replace` method replaces both matches with a single "/". In the original code, the `replace` method only replaces the "index" match, leaving the "default" match untouched.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\/(index|default)\.[a-z]+$/` matches both "index" and "default" at the end of the URL path, and the `replace` method replaces both matches
