  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end == null) return cb && cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while this replacement uses the `==` operator, which only checks for value equality. This means that if `end` is a non-null object, the original code would not have returned `cb && cb(end)`, but the replacement code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (end === null) return cb && cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `==` operator, which checks for value equality, while this replacement uses the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality.
