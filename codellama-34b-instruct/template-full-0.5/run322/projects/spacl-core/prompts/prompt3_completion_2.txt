  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for an empty string, while the new code fragment requires at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for an empty string, while the new code fragment requires at least one character and does not allow for the string to end with a hyphen.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]?$/
```
