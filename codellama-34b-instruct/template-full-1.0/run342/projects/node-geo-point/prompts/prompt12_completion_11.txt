  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point.type` property is now being mutated, which could have unintended consequences in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type === 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now checking for equality instead of inequality, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is now always false, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
