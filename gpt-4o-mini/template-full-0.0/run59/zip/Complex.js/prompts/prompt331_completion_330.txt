Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is not equal to zero, which would lead to the inner block being executed when `a` is non-zero, potentially returning different results than when `a` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is greater than zero instead of checking if `a` is zero, which would change the conditions under which the inner block executes, affecting the output for complex numbers with positive imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is zero, which is a different condition than checking if `a` is zero alone, leading to different execution paths and potentially incorrect results for certain complex numbers.

DONE.
