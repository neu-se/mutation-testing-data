  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the `promise` string would be passed as the second argument to the `bootstrap` function, which is not a valid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and an empty function would be passed as the second argument to the `bootstrap` function, which is not a valid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", "definition"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, and the string "definition" would be passed as the second argument to the `bootstrap` function, which is not a valid argument.

DONE.
