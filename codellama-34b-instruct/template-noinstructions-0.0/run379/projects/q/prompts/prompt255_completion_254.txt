  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` array would be accessed at index 0, which may not exist, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` array would be accessed at index 1, which may not exist, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message.length` property would be accessed, which may not exist, causing an error.

DONE.
