  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, while `Object.values` returns an array of the property values themselves. This could produce unexpected results if the code is expecting a certain property name to be present in the `Object.keys` array, but it is not included in the object's `Object.values`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs for each enumerable string property in the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of property names. This could produce unexpected results if the code is expecting a certain property name to be present in the `Object.keys` array, but it is included in the object's `Object.entries` array as a key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.has
