Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the angle used in the cosine and sine calculations, effectively shifting the output of the complex exponential function, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the angle, which changes the output of the cosine and sine functions, leading to a different complex number than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the angle with a constant value (Ï€), which would produce a fixed output regardless of the input complex number, thus deviating from the expected behavior of the function.

DONE.
