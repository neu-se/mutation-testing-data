  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"setValue"
```
This would result in different behavior because "setValue" is not a valid property of the Promise prototype, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set" + "Value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression "set" + "Value" evaluates to the string "setValue", which is not a valid property of the Promise prototype, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set" + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression "set" + key would evaluate to a string that is the concatenation of the string "set" and the value of the variable key, which is not a valid property of the Promise prototype, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
