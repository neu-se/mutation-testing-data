  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `loop` variable is set to `true` instead of `false`, which would cause the loop to continue indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sync = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sync` variable is set to `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the loop to continue indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the `end` and `data` arguments in a different order than the original code.

DONE.
