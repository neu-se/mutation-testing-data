  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid error object. If the function is called with `null` as the error argument, it will not throw an error as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid error object. If the function is called with `undefined` as the error argument, it will not throw an error as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid error object. If the function is called with `true` as the error argument, it will not throw an error as expected.

DONE.
