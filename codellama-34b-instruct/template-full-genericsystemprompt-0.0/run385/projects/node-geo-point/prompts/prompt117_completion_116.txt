  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a GeoPoint object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object with non-zero latitude and longitude values, but a GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude values of 0 would cause the calculateDestination method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but a number (the longitude value) would cause the calculateDestination method to return a different result.

DONE.
