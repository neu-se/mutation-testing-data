  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is misspelled, and the replacement code fragment is correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and the test suite should catch this.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilliz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment is incorrect, and the test suite should catch this.

DONE.
