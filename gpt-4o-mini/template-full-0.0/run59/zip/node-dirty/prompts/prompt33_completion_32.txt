Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the key to `null` would not delete the key from the `_data` map, whereas the original code (`undefined`) would remove the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'deleted'
```
This would result in different behavior because setting the key to the string `'deleted'` would store that value in the `_data` map instead of removing it, leading to incorrect data being retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this._data.get(key)` would attempt to set the key to its current value, effectively doing nothing if the key exists, while the original code would remove the key from the map if the value was `undefined`.

DONE.
