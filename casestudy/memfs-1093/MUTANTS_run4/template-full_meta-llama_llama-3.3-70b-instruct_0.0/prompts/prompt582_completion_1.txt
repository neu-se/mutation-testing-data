Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, which could potentially cause issues if the `closeFile` method relies on its original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.closeFile.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` returns a string representation of the function, rather than the function itself, which would cause a TypeError when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.closeFile(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new anonymous function that calls `closeFile` with the `file` argument, rather than passing `closeFile` as a reference to be called later, which could affect the timing and context of the `closeFile` call.

DONE.
