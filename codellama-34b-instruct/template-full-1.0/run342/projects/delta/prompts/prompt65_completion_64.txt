  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to `arg`, which is a function parameter that is expected to be a string or an object. By setting `newOp.insert` to `null`, the code would likely break any code that relies on the existence of `newOp.insert` or its contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.retain` to `length` if `length` is a number, and leaves it unset otherwise. By setting `newOp.retain` to 1, the code would return a different result for inputs where `length` is not a number, and would also cause the `retain` method to always be called with a value of 1, rather than with the value of `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
