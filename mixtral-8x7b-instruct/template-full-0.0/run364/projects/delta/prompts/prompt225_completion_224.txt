 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
['string1', 'string2', cursor]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with three elements instead of using the `strings` array, which could cause the `diffResult` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
strings.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `strings` array, so any changes made to the `strings` array later on will not affect the `diffResult`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[strings[1], strings[0], cursor]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the `strings` array elements, which could cause the `diffResult` to be incorrect.

DONE.
