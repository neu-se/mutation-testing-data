  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Testing mutation"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, which would trigger the rejection handler in the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which would not trigger the rejection handler in the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Testing mutation");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with a string message, which would not trigger the rejection handler in the test.

DONE.
