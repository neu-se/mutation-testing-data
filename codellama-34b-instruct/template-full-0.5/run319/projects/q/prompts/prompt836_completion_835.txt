  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.unbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `unbind` is a different method than `bind`, and it may not have the same effect on the program's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.handle
```
This would result in different behavior because `handle` is a different method than `bind`, and it may not have the same effect on the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `exit` is a different method than `bind`, and it may not have the same effect on the program's behavior.

DONE.
