  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is now being called with a different argument, which could potentially produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` function is now being called with a different argument, which could potentially produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` function is now being called with a different argument, which could potentially produce a different result.

DONE.
