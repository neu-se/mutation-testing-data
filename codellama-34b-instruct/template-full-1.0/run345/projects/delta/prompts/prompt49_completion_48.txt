  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object['constructor']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.constructor` is a reference to the constructor function for objects, while `Object.keys` is a method that returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object['prototype']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is a reference to the prototype object for objects, while `Object.keys` is a method that returns an array of the keys in the object.

DONE.
