  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 if (this['isNaN'](a) || this['isNaN'](b)) {return [a, b];}
```
This would result in different behavior because this buggy solution does not address the insimilar behavior when inequalitites cannot be determined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a == b){return [a, b];}
```
This would result in different behavior because this buggy solution does not address the practice that complex numbers can be considered equal when both their real and imaginary part are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['equals']()){return [this['re'], this['im']];}
```
This would result in different behavior because this buggy solution does not address the practice that complex numbers can be considered equal the return value of `equals` when both real and imaginary part are equal.
