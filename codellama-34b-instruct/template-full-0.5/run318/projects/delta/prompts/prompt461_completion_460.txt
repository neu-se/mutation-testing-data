  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.rest())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `next` element with the result of the `rest()` method, which is a new array containing the remaining elements in the `ops` array after the current index. In the original code, the `rest()` method is only called if the `offset` is greater than 0, and it returns a new array containing the remaining elements in the `ops` array after the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `next` element with the result of slicing the `ops` array from the current index to the end. In the original code, the `rest()` method is only called if the `offset` is greater than 0, and it returns a new array containing the remaining elements in the `ops` array after the current index.

Option 3:
