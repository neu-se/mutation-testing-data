Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly converts degrees to radians without using the `deg2rad` function, which may not account for any additional logic or adjustments that `deg2rad` might implement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude instead of the latitude, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(coordinate.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the conversion of latitude from degrees to radians with the sine of the latitude, which is not a valid operation for the intended calculation and would yield nonsensical results.

DONE.
