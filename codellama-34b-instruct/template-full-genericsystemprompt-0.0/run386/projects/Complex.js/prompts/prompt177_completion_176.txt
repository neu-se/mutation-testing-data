  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the intended behavior for the `pow` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the intended behavior for the `pow` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the intended behavior for the `pow` function.

DONE.
