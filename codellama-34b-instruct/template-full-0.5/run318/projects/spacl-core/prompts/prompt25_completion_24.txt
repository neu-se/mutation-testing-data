  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && !opt && min < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `!opt` would negate the `opt` variable, causing the code to execute the `min < 1` condition even if `opt` is true, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `min < 2` would change the minimum number of matches required, which would affect the outcome of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
final && opt && min > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `min > 1` would change the minimum number of matches required, which would affect the outcome of the code.

DONE.
