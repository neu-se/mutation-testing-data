  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises, but `null` is not an array and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises, but `undefined` is not an array and will cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function expects an array of promises, but an empty array will cause the function to resolve immediately without waiting for any of the promises to settle.

DONE.
