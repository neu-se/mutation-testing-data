  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the callback throws an error, while the modified code fragment would always reject the promise with the value `undefined`, regardless of whether the callback throws an error or not.
