  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while this modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere with an offset of 180 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while this modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere with a scale factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere, while this modified code fragment calculates the bearing between two points on a sphere with an offset of -180 degrees.

DONE.
