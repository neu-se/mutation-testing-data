 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for explicit equality with `undefined` instead of using the "not truthy" check, potentially allowing objects with falsy values (e.g., `{}`, `[]`, `0`, `''`) to pass the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!('current' in result[country])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the explicit presence of the `current` property instead of checking if the property value is not truthy. This change would allow objects without the `current` property but with other falsy values (e.g., `result[country] = { all: [] }`) to pass the condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.hasOwnProperty(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for direct object ownership of the `country` property instead of checking if the property value is not truth
