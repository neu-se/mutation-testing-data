  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)` is a different function call than `Q.nbind.apply(this, args)`, and the `void 0` argument is not a valid context for the `Q.nbind` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(this, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.apply(this, args)` is a different function call than `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)`, and the `this` argument is not a valid context for the `Q.nbind` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.apply(null, args)` is a different
