  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(() => {throw new Error('Mutation Testing');})();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of `val`, while this buggy code fragment would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of `val`, while this buggy code fragment would return the value of `val + 1` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val ?? 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the value of `val`, while this buggy code fragment would return the value of `42` if `val` is `null` or `undefined` instead.

DONE.
