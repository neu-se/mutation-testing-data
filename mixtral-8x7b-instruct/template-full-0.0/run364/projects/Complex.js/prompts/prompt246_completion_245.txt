 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` (hyperbolic sine) is not the same as `sin` (sine). This change would affect the output of the `exp` method when the imaginary part is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a division by zero error when the sine of the input is zero. This change would affect the output of the `exp` method when the imaginary part is zero and the real part is an integer multiple of Ï€.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` (arc sine) is not the same as `sin` (sine). This change would affect the output of the `exp` method when the imaginary part is not zero.

DONE.
