  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("deprecated")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always log a warning message to the console, regardless of whether the `console` object is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console.warn === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `console.warn` function is defined, but it would not check if the `console` object is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof console !== "undefined" && typeof console.warn === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `console` object is defined and if the `console.warn` function is defined, which is the same as the original code.

DONE.
