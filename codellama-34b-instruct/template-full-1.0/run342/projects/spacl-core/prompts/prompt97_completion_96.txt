  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a method on the `PolicyMap` object and `this.get.call(this)` would call the `get` method on a different object, potentially causing a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a method on the `PolicyMap` object and `this.get(name)` would call the `get` method on a different object, potentially causing a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses would group the expression and potentially cause a syntax error.

DONE.
