  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled" && promise.inspect().value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled and the value is undefined instead of checking if the promise is fulfilled and the value is not undefined.

DONE.
