  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the `if` statement would only evaluate to `true` if `end` is strictly unequal to `true`, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `true` if `end` is falsy.
