  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" does not expect the target as the first argument, but the "this" context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [this, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" expects the target as the first argument, but "this" represents the context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind", [this, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" expects the target as the first argument, but "this" represents the context.

DONE.
