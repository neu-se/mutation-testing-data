  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not removing the query string from the URL, but the replacement code fragment does remove the query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"").toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not converting the URL to lowercase, but the replacement code fragment does convert the URL to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"").split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not splitting the URL by "/" and taking the first part, but the replacement code fragment does split the URL by "/" and takes the first part.

DONE.
