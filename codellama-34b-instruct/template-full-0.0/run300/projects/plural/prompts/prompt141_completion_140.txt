  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` variable is a function that returns a string, whereas `rule[0]` is a string or a regular expression. Using `rule[1]` would cause the function to return a different string than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a string that is not present in the original code fragment. Using `rule[2]` would cause the function to return a different string than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is a string that is not present in the original code fragment. Using `rule[3]` would cause the function to return a different string than the original code fragment.

DONE.
