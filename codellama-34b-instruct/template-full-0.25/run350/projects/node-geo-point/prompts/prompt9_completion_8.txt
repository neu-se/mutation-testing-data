  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'typee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is misspelled, causing the code to access a non-existent property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is concatenated with a string, causing the code to access a different property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is subtracted by 1, causing the code to access a different property.

DONE.
