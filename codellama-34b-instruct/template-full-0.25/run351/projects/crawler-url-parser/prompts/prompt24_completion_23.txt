  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^#]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any character that is not a "#" at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches any character that is not a "#" at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence of "#" at the end of the string, while the new code fragment matches all occurrences of "#" at the end of the string.

DONE.
