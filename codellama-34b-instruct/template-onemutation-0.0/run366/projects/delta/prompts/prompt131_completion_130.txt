  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `nextOp` object onto the `ops` array, which is not what the original code fragment does. The original code fragment only pushes the `nextOp` object onto the `ops` array if it meets certain conditions, such as if it is an insert operation or if it has a non-null `attributes` property.

DONE.
