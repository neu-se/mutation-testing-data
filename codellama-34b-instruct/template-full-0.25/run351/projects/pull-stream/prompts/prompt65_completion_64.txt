  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with `null` as the argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` function with `undefined` as the argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
