  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is a different expression than `a`, and may produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a ** 2` is a different expression than `a`, and may produce a different result.

DONE.
