  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` function to always return the same value, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType".toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` function to always return a value that is different from the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"embedType".length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` function to always return a value that is different from the input.

DONE.
