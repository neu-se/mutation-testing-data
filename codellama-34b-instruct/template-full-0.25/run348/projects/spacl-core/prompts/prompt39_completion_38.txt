  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an empty array, instead of an array with a single element containing the string "1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with a single element containing the string "1", instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array with two elements, instead of an array with a single element containing the string "1".

DONE.
