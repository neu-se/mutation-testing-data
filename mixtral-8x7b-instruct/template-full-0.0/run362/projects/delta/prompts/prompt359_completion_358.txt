 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg + priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation would concatenate the `arg` and `priority` values if they are strings, or perform arithmetic addition if they are numbers. The original code fragment uses a comma operator, which evaluates both expressions but discards the result of the first expression (`arg`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg && priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical AND operator (`&&`) would return `priority` if `arg` is truthy, and `false` otherwise. The original code fragment uses a comma operator, which evaluates both expressions but discards the result of the first expression (`arg`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg ? priority : arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would return `priority` if `arg` is truthy, and `arg` otherwise. The
