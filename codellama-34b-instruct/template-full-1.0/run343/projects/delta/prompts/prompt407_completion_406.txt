  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (transformedData !== null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `transformedData` is truthy before accessing its properties, whereas this replacement assumes that it is always an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (handler.transform !== undefined) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assumes that `handler.transform` is a function, whereas this replacement checks if it is defined before calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData, otherData, !priority);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `priority` argument as-is to `handler.transform`, whereas this replacement passes the negation of `priority`.

DONE.
