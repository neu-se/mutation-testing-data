  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `priority` are added together, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `priority` are subtracted from each other, which would also change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg ^ priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `priority` are exponentiated together, which would produce a completely different output than the original code.

DONE.
