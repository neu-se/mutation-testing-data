  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs`, but in this new code, it is not pushed, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs`, but in this new code, it pushes `deferred.reject` instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs`, but in this new code, it pushes `null` instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
