Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise instead of waiting for it to settle, causing the `allResolved` function to return a rejected promise even if the original promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the fulfillment of the promise and not handle the resolved value, potentially leading to a situation where the promise is never resolved in the context of `allResolved`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only handle rejections and not fulfillments, which means that if the promise is fulfilled, it would not be processed correctly, leading to an incomplete resolution of the promises in `allResolved`.

DONE.
