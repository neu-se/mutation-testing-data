Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using the tangent function instead of the sine function will change the calculation of the x variable, leading to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because using the sine of φ1 instead of φ2 will incorrectly reference the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, leading to inaccurate bearing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because substituting the cosine function for the sine function will alter the calculation of the x variable, resulting in an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
