  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation, which may not be the same as the attributes of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a null value instead of the attributes of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use an undefined value instead of the attributes of the current operation.

DONE.
