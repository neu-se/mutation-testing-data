  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, not `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, not `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, not `this`.

DONE.
