 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would not be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because if the code is running in a browser environment, the global `window` object would be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function instead of the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return this; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the value of `this` in a function, which would change its context when passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

DONE.
