  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `op.retain && op.attributes` is checking if `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is defined, while the new code fragment `true` is always true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `op.retain && op.attributes` is checking if `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is defined, while the new code fragment `false` is always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `op.retain && op.attributes` is checking if `op.retain` is truthy and `op.attributes` is defined, while the new code fragment `op.attributes || true` is checking if `op.attributes` is truthy or `
