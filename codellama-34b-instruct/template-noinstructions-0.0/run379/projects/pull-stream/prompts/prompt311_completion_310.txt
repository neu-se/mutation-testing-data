  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, while `null` is a literal value that does not refer to any variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, while `undefined` is a literal value that does not refer to any variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"data"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, while `"data"` is a string literal that does not refer to any variable.

DONE.
