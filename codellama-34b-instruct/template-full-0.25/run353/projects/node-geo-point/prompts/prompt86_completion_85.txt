  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angular distance, while this replacement uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not add a constant term to the calculation of the sine of the angular distance, while this replacement adds a constant term.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + sinφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a term that is proportional to the sine
