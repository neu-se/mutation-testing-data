  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of the variable `a`. However, replacing it with `a + 1` would return the value of `a` plus 1, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of the variable `a`. However, replacing it with `b` would return the value of the variable `b`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `a`, which would return the value of the variable `a`. However, replacing it with `a * b` would return the product of `a` and `b`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
