  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten if it already exists, whereas the original code fragment did not specify any options, so the file would be appended to if it already existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
