  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is a falsy value, so the function Complex would return a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because {} is an empty object, so the function Complex would return a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object value, so the function Complex would return a different result than the original code.

Done.
