  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is a property access expression, which would evaluate to a value, whereas `inspect` is a function call expression, which would evaluate to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a function call expression, which would evaluate to a value, whereas `inspect` is a function name, which would evaluate to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.bind(this)` is a function expression, which would evaluate to a function, whereas `inspect` is a function name, which would evaluate to a function.

DONE.
