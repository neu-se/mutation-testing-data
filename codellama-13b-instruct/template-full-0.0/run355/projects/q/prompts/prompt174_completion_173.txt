  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the line number would cause the code to skip over the next line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the line number would cause the code to skip over the previous line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the line number would cause the code to skip over the next two lines.

DONE.
