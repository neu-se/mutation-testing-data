  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point, rather than the second point, which is the intent of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point, rather than the longitude, which is the intent of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point1.longitude + point2.longitude) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the average of the longitudes of the two points, rather than the longitude of the second point, which is the intent of the code.

DONE.
