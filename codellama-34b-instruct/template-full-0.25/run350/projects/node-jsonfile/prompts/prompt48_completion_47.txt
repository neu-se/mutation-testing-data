  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + "bug"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, while `str + "bug"` is a concatenation of a string and a non-string value, which would result in a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, while `str.toUpperCase()` is a string with all characters in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, while `str.length` is the length of the string as a number.

DONE.
