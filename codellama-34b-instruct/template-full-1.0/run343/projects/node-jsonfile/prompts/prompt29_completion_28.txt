  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with
```
stringify(obj, 'INVALID')
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `stringify` is used to specify the space parameter for formatting, and passing an invalid value like `'INVALID'` would cause the function to throw an error, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with
```
nullify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nullify` is not a valid function, and calling it would cause an error, which would change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with
```
stringify(obj, options.space)
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.space` is not a valid property, and accessing it would cause an error, which would change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
