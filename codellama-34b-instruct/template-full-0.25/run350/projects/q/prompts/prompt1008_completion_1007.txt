  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive a `null` value instead of the expected arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive an `undefined` value instead of the expected arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive an empty array instead of the expected
