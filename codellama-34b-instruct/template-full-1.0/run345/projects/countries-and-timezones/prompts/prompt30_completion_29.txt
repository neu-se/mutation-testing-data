  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called recursively instead of being called once, which could lead to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getNumStr` function is called with a different argument, `offset`, instead of `num`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is called instead of the `getNumStr` function, which could cause the function to return a different value for the `utcOffsetStr` property.

DONE.
