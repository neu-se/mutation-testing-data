  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the replacement code fragment is a string concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the replacement code fragment is a string slice.

DONE.
