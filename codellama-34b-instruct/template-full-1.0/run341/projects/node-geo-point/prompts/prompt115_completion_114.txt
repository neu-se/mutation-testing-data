  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 179
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the latitude to be slightly off, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 181
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the latitude to be slightly off, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 179
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the longitude to be slightly off, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
