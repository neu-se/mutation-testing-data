  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a word as input and returns the plural form of the word by replacing the last two characters with "ices". However, the buggy code fragment provided in Option 1 would not replace the last two characters with "ices", resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes a word as input and returns the plural form of the word by replacing the last two characters with "ices". However, the buggy code fragment provided in Option 2 would replace the last two characters with "ices" and then append an additional "s" to the end of the word, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3
