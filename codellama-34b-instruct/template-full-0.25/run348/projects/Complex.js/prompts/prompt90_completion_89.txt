  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `-` to `+`, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `-` to `*`, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '/' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `-` to `/`, which would cause the result to be different.

DONE.
