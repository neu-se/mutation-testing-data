Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round down the index to the nearest integer instead of rounding up, potentially changing the selected quantile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the index, potentially changing the range of the array that is being sorted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the left index of the current range instead of the right index, potentially changing the range of the array that is being sorted and affecting the overall quantile calculation.

DONE.
