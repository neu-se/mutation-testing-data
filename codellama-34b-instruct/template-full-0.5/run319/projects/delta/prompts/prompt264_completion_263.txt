  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `retain` property of the two operations instead of the `attributes` property, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `insert` property of the two operations instead of the `attributes` property, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `attributes` property of the first operation with the `delete` property of the second operation, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

DONE.
