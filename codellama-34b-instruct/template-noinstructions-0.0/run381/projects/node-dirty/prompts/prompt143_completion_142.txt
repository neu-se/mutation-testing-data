  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this new code fragment emits an error event with a new error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this new code fragment emits an error event with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the original error object, while this new code fragment emits an error event with an undefined value.

DONE.
