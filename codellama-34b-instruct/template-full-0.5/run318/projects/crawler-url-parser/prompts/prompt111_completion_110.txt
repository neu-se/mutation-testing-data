  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL would be changed to a different domain, which could affect the results of the URL parsing and extraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL would be changed to a different domain, which could affect the results of the URL parsing and extraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"ftp://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL would be changed to a different protocol, which could affect the results of the URL parsing and extraction.

DONE.
