Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value passed to the `once` function, causing it to always treat the end condition as `true`, which may lead to premature termination of the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `once` function would not trigger the intended behavior of handling the end condition properly, potentially leading to unexpected results in the stream processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `'error'` to the `once` function would not match the expected boolean logic, which could cause the stream to not terminate correctly and lead to incorrect error handling.

DONE.
