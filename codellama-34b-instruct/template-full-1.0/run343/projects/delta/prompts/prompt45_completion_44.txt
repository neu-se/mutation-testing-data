  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because when `b` is an object, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the modified code fragment would return `true`, causing the `throw` statement to be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when `b` is undefined, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the modified code fragment would return `true`, causing the `throw` statement to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `b` is 0, the original code fragment would return `false`, but the modified code fragment would return `true`, causing the `throw` statement to be executed.

DONE.
