  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be calculating the arctangent of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code calculates the arctangent of `b` and `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(b), sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be calculating the square root of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code calculates the square root of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be calculating the arctangent of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code calculates the arctangent of `b` and `a`.

DONE.
