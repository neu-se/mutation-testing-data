 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map, which does not have a `length` property. The original code uses the `size` property, which is the correct property to use for getting the size of a Map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys().next().value` returns the first key in the Map, whereas `this._data.size` returns the number of key-value pairs in the Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.values().next().value` returns the first value in the Map, whereas `this._data.size` returns the number of key-value pairs in the Map.

DONE.
