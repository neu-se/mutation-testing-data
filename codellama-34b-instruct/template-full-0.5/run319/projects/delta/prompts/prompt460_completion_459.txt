  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to start at the next index, rather than the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `slice` method to start at the previous index, rather than the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` would cause the `slice` method to start at the beginning of the array, rather than the current index.

DONE.
