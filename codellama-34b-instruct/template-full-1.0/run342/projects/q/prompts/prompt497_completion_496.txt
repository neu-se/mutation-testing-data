  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes `reason`, which refers to the exception that was passed to the `reject` method, while the new code fragment uses `null`, which would not provide any useful information for error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reason`, which is a variable that represents the exception thrown by the `reject` method, while the new code fragment uses `undefined`, which would not be a valid exception object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `reason`, which is a variable that represents the exception thrown by the `reject` method, while the new code fragment uses the number 42, which is not a valid exception object.

DONE.
