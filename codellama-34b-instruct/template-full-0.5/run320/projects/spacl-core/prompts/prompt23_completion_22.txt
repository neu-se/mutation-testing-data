  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the input string starting from the second character, instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the input string in lowercase, regardless of the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the input string in reverse order.

DONE.
