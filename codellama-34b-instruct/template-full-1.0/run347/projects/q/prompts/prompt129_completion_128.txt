  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key[index] = index;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value of the `keys` array with the index of the current iteration, instead of pushing the key to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the key to the `keys` array, but it would do so using the `push` method of the `keys` array, which could potentially have different behavior than the original `push` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(key).push(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `push` method on the `keys` array using the value of `key` as the `this` argument, which could potentially have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
