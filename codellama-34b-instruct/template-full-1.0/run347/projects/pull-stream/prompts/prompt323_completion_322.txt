  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` checks if `onEnd` is truthy, while the new code fragment `!onEnd` checks if `onEnd` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` preserves the value of `onEnd`, while the new code fragment `onEnd + 1` increments the value of `onEnd`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` preserves the value of `onEnd`, while the new code fragment `onEnd - 1` decrements the value of `onEnd`.

DONE.
