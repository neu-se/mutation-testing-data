  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `read` as the argument to `next()`, while this replacement uses `null` instead. This could cause the `next()` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `read` as the argument to `next()`, while this replacement uses `undefined` instead. This could cause the `next()` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `read` as the argument to `next()`, while this replacement uses the value of `read` again as the argument to `next()`. This could cause the `next()` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different results or errors
