 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `verb` property of the generator instead of calling the method referenced by the `verb` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator["" + verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the method referenced by the `verb` variable as a string, which would result in a syntax error if the method name is not a valid identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call the method referenced by the `verb` variable immediately, instead of passing it as a callback to the `continuer` function.

DONE.
