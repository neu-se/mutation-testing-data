  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is 1, but in this modified code, it is 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is 1, but in this modified code, it is the length of the array minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is 1, but in this modified code, it is the current value of the loop counter `i`.

DONE.
