  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts `index` from `end`, which would result in a negative value if `index` is greater than `end`. However, adding `index` to `end` would result in a positive value, which would cause the loop to continue even if `index` is greater than `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts `index` from `end`, which would result in a negative value if `index` is greater than `end`. However, subtracting 1 from the result would result in a positive value, which would cause the loop to continue even if `index` is greater than `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts `index` from `end`, which would result in
