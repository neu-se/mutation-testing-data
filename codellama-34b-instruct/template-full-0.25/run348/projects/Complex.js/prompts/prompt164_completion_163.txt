  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite, while this new code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite.

DONE.
