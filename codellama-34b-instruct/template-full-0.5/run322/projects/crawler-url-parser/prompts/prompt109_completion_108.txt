  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` property is being added twice to the `Map`, which could cause issues when trying to retrieve the value associated with a key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is being used instead of the `url` property, which could cause issues when trying to retrieve the value associated with a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property is being used instead of the `url` property, which could cause issues when trying to retrieve the value associated with a key.

DONE.
