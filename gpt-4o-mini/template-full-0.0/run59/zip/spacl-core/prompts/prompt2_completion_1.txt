Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks for the presence of a substring rather than matching the entire string against a regex pattern, which could allow invalid characters in the path specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match of a regex in the string, which would not return `null` for invalid characters, potentially allowing invalid paths to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` would attempt to divide the string into an array based on a delimiter, which does not validate the string against a regex pattern, thus bypassing the check for invalid characters entirely.

DONE.
