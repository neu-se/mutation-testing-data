  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument would be passed to the `pull` function, which would cause the `switch` statement to execute a different branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument would be passed to the `pull` function, which would cause the `switch` statement to execute a different branch.

DONE.
