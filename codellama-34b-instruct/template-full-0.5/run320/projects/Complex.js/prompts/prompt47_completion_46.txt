  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a && 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the second operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the condition to evaluate to false even if `'abs'` and `'arg'` are both present in `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in b && 'arg' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the first operand is now `b` instead of `a`, which would cause the condition to evaluate to false even if `'abs'` and `'arg'` are both present in `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abs' in a || 'arg' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is now `||` instead of `&&`, which would cause the condition to evaluate to true if either `'abs'` or `'arg'` is present in `a` or `b`.

DONE.
