  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    Q.return(foo + bar);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `Q.return` function instead of `return`, which would return a value from the generator function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo - bar;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `foo` and `bar` instead of adding them, which would change the result of the generator function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {
    var foo = yield getFooPromise();
    var bar = yield getBarPromise();
    return foo + bar + 1;
