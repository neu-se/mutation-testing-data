  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` creates a new array with all the elements of `arguments` except for the first one, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function, including the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` returns an array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the third one, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_filter(arguments, function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter(arguments, function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })` filters the
