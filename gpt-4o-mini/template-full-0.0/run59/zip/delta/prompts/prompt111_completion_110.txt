Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation `op` into the `target` array instead of the result of the predicate evaluation, potentially leading to incorrect partitioning of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.unshift(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the current operation `op` to the beginning of the `target` array instead of the end, which would change the order of operations in the resulting partition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
target.push(op.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to push the `attributes` of the current operation `op` into the `target` array instead of the operation itself, which could lead to loss of operation context and incorrect partitioning.

DONE.
