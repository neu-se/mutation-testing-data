  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the hash symbol with an empty string, while this new fragment would remove the hash symbol and everything after it from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the question mark symbol with an empty string, while this new fragment would remove the question mark symbol and everything after it from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the hash symbol with an empty string, while this new fragment would remove the hash symbol and everything after it from the URL and then concatenate the base URL string to the remaining URL.

DONE.
