Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always attempt to retrieve a policy with the name 'unknown', which will likely not exist, leading to a consistent return value of `null` regardless of the actual input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the name by appending '1', which means it will look for a policy with a name that is different from the original, potentially resulting in a `null` return if no such policy exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the policy name to uppercase, which may not match the actual policy names stored in the `PolicyMap`, leading to a `null` return if the names are case-sensitive.

DONE.
