  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(a)` is the tangent function, which is different from the original code fragment `2 * a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different expression than `2 * a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin(a)` is the arcsin function, which is different from the original code fragment `2 * a`.

DONE.
