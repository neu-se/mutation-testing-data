 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the value to the callback, while this change would always pass null as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes two arguments to the callback, while this change would pass only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function, while this change would call the `onAbort` function instead.

DONE.
