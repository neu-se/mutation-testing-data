  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `true` for both `num === 1` and `num === undefined`, while this code fragment would only return `true` for `num === 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `true` for both `num === 1` and `num === undefined`, while this code fragment would only return `true` for `num === 1` and `num === 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return `true` for both `num === 1` and `num === undefined`, while this code fragment would only return `true` for `num === 1` and `num === 0`.
