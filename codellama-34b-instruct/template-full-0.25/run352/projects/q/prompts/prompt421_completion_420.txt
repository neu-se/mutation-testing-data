  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `value` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the `value` is an object with a `then` method, which is not necessarily the same as checking if it is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function checks if the `value` is a fulfilled promise, which is not necessarily the same as checking if it is a promise.

DONE.
