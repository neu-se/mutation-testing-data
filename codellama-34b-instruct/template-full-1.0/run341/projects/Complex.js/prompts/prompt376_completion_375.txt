  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used to calculate the `sinh` and `cosh` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used to calculate the `sinh` and `cosh` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `d` variable, which is used to calculate the `sinh` and `cosh` values.

DONE.
