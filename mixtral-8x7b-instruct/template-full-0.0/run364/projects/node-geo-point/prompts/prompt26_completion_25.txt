 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't convert the latitude to radians, instead multiplying it by 1, which would cause incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.toRadians(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.toRadians` is not a valid JavaScript function, causing a runtime error in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan` calculates the arctangent of a number, which is not the same as converting degrees to radians. This would cause incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance` method.

DONE.
