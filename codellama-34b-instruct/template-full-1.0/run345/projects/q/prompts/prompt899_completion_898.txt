  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new function, while `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, while `console.log` is a function that only logs its arguments to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, while the replacement function accepts no arguments.
