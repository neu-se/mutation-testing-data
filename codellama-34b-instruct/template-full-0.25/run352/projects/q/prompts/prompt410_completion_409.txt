  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `value` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `value` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `value` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
