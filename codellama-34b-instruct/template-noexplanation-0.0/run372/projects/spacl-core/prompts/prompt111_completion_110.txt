  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.keys()
```
This code fragment will return an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, which can then be used in the `for` loop to iterate over the keys and perform the desired actions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(verbs)
```
This code fragment will return an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, which can then be used in the `for` loop to iterate over the keys and perform the desired actions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.values()
```
This code fragment will return an array of the values in the `verbs` object, which can then be used in the `for` loop to iterate over the values and perform the desired actions.

DONE.
