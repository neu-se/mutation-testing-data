  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return errback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the errback function with the arguments provided to continuer, instead of binding it to the verb "throw" and the generated value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error message, rather than following the normal path of resolving the promise with the generated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that never resolves, rather than returning a promise that resolves with the generated value.

DONE.
