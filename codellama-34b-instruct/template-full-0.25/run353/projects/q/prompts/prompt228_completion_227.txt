  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the arguments to the `messages` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `messages` array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.shift(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `messages` array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
