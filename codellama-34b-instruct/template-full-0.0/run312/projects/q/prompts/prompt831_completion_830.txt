  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be in a pending state instead of being fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with an undefined value instead of the original value.

DONE.
