  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Î¸ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses a modulo operation to wrap the angle around the 360 degree circle. This can cause the bearing to be calculated incorrectly, especially for large distances or angles.

DONE.
