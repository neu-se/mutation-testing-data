  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method takes no arguments, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when called with an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, not the number of operations remaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property of the iterator is an array of operations, not a number.

DONE.
