  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.reject` would reject the promise with the error, whereas `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would reject the promise with the error, whereas `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` would reject the promise with the error, whereas `ends.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error.

DONE.
