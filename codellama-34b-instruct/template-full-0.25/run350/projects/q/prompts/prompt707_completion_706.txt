  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to slice the `arguments` object from the first argument, while the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to slice the `arguments` object from the second argument. This would cause the `fbound` function to receive a different set of arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to slice the `arguments` object from the first argument, while the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)` to slice the `arguments` object from the third argument. This would cause the `fbound` function to receive a different set of arguments, which could result in different behavior.
