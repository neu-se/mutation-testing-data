  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function would be negated, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the two values are not equal, and `false` when they are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function would be used instead of `isEqual`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the two values are not equal, and `false` when they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would be used instead of `===` to check for equality, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the two values are not equal, and `false` when they are equal.

DONE.
