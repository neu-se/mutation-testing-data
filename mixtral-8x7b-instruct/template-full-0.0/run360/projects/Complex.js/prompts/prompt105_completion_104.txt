 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat('-' + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the following number when the current token is 'i' or 'I', which might lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] / (abs + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the real part by the absolute value plus one, which might lead to incorrect results when calculating the sign of complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Complex(Math.random(), Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random complex number instead of the sign of the original complex number, which might lead to incorrect results in further calculations.

DONE.
