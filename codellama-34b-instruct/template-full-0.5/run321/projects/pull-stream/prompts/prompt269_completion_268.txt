  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the function to return `true` when the stream is not ended, rather than `false` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits and returns the second operand (`true`) if the first operand (`end`) is truthy, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits and returns the first operand (`end`) if it is truthy, and the second operand (`false`) if `end` is falsy.

DONE.
