Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset => offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the absolute value calculation, allowing negative offsets to be treated as positive, potentially leading to incorrect UTC offset strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds the offset up to the nearest integer, instead of taking the absolute value, which could result in incorrect hour calculations for the UTC offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the absolute value calculation and rounds the offset down to the nearest integer, potentially leading to incorrect hour calculations for the UTC offset string, especially for negative offsets.

DONE.
