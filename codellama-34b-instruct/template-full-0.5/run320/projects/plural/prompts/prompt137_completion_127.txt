  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `rule` array is not a function, so it would not be called with the `word` and `regex` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "hello" is not a function, so it would not be called with the `word` and `regex` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w, regex) { return w + "es" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the word with "es" appended to it, regardless of the value of `regex`.

DONE.
