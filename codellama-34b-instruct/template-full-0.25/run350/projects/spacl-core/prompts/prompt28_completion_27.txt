  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function would return a different regular expression, which would cause the `Matcher` class to produce different results for certain input strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function would return a different regular expression, which would cause the `Matcher` class to produce different results for certain input strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function would return a different regular expression, which would cause the `Matcher` class to produce different results for certain input strings.

DONE.
