  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` does not advance the iterator, while `next` does, so in this case, the iteration would be skipping the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(2)` would advance the iterator by 2 elements, so the iteration would be skipping the third element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be using a different iterator, so the iteration would behave differently.

DONE.
