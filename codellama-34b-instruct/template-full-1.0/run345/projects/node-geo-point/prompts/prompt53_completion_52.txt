  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is applied to the unconverted values of `θ` and `Δλ`, leading to a result that is much larger than the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ * Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is applied to the converted values of `θ` and `Δλ`, leading to a result that is much smaller than the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is applied to the converted values of `θ` and `Δλ`, leading to a result that is much larger than the expected value.

DONE.
