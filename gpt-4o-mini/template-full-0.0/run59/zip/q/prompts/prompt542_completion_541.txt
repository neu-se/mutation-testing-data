Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the first element of the array (which may not exist) to the `fulfilled` callback instead of spreading all elements, potentially leading to unexpected results if the array has more than one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the array to the `fulfilled` callback, effectively ignoring all other elements, which changes the intended behavior of spreading all arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the number `1` to the end of the array before passing it to the `fulfilled` callback, altering the original array's contents and potentially leading to incorrect results in the callback.

DONE.
