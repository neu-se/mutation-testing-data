  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if `resolvedPromise` is `undefined`.

DONE.
