  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the country object with its entirety, it would return a partial country object with only the timezone information, which may be unexpected for some consumers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(countryId, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string 'foo' as the second argument to the function, which may cause a type error or unexpected behavior depending on the implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(1, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a number 1 as the first argument to the function, which may cause a type error or unexpected behavior depending on the implementation.

DONE.
