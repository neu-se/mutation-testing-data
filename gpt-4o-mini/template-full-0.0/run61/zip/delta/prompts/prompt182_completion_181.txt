Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the length used in the operation, potentially causing the resulting `Delta` to include more operations than intended, leading to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively ignores the length of the `otherOp`, which could lead to the `Delta` being composed incorrectly, as it would not account for any length from `otherOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of `thisOp` instead of `otherOp`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operations, potentially resulting in a `Delta` that does not accurately reflect the intended composition of the two `Delta` instances.

DONE.
