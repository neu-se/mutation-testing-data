  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original `reject(exception)` call rejects the promise with the provided exception, while the new `reject(exception, true)` call rejects the promise with the provided exception and the `true` value as a second argument. This would change the behavior of the resulting error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

<PLACEHOLDER>(new Error(exception.message))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `reject(exception)` call rejects the promise with the provided exception, while the new `reject(new Error(exception.message))` call rejects the promise with a new error that has the same message as the original exception. This would change the behavior of the resulting error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `
