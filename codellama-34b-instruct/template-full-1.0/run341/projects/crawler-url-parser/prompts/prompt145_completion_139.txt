  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'../'
```
This would result in different behavior because '../' is a path that refers to the parent directory, whereas '/' is a path that refers to the root directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'../../'
```
This would result in different behavior because '../../' is a path that refers to the parent directory's parent directory, whereas '/' is a path that refers to the root directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because '#' is a path that refers to the current directory, whereas '/' is a path that refers to the root directory.

DONE.
