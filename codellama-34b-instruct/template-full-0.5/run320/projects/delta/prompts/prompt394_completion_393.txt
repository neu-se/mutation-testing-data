  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the `OpIterator` class is called with `0` as the argument, which would return the first element of the iterator, rather than the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the `OpIterator` class is called with `-1` as the argument, which would return the last element of the iterator, rather than the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() < 0.5 ? 1 : -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method of the `OpIterator` class is called with a random value as the argument, which would return a random element of the iterator, rather than the next element.

DONE.
