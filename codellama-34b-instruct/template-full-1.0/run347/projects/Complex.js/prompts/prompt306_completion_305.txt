  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would attempt to divide by zero, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = a;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would attempt to divide by zero, which would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = 2 * a / Math.cos(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan` function would attempt to divide by zero, which would throw an error.

DONE.
