 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries['incorrect_id'], options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a non-existent or incorrect country ID, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect country object or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id], {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the provided `options` object with an empty object for the specific country, potentially causing unexpected behavior in other parts of the application that rely on those options.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
countries[id], getAllCountries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `getAllCountries()` result as the `options` object for the specific country, potentially causing unexpected behavior in other parts of the application that rely on the actual options object.

DONE.
