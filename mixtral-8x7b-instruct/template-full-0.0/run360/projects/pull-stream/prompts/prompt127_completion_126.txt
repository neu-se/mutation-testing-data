 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would immediately terminate the Node.js process instead of continuing to execute and call the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operation (i++) is not being performed, so the value of `i` passed to the callback function would be the same every time, instead of increasing by one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `i` is being set to the value of `max`, which would cause the function to immediately return `true` after being called `max` number of times, instead of incrementing `i` and continuing to call the callback function.

DONE.
