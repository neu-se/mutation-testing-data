  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would only be called if `abort` is not true, while the new code fragment would call `read` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || false, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would only be called if `abort` is not true, while the new code fragment would call `read` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would only be called if `abort` is not true, while the new code fragment would call `read` regardless of the value of `abort`.

DONE.
