  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` variable, which is a number, instead of the `utcOffset` variable, which is a string. This would cause the function to return a different string representation of the offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `utcOffset` variable, which is a string, instead of the `dstOffset` variable, which is a number. This would cause the function to return a different string representation of the offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the sum of the `utcOffset` and `dstOffset` variables, which is
