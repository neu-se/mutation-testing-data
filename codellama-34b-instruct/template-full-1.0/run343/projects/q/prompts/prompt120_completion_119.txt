  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable
```
This would result in different behavior because `propertyIsEnumerable` returns `false` if the property is inherited, while `hasOwnProperty` returns `true` regardless of whether the property is inherited.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Array` object and returns `true` when called on an array with the given property name, while `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` returns `false` regardless of the type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null).hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method on every object except those created with `Object.create(null)`, which returns `false` when called on such an object with the given property name.

DONE.
