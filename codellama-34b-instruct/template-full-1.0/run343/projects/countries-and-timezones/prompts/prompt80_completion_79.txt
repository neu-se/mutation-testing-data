  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName + "random-string")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `getTimezone` with a different argument than the original code, which could lead to a different result or an error if the function expects a specific format for the `name` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `getTimezone` with a different argument than the original code, which could lead to a different result or an error if the function expects a string for the `name` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `getTimezone` with an undefined `name` parameter, which could lead to an error or unexpected behavior if the function does not handle undefined values correctly.

DONE.
