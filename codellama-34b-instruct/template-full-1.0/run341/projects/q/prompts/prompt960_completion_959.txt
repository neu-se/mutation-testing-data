  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, and `args[0]` would be the first argument passed to the function, whereas `arguments` is an object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is an object that refers to the current function, and `this[0]` would be the first property of that object, whereas `arguments` is an object that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the arguments except the first one, whereas `args` would return the first argument only.

DONE.
