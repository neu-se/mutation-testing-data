  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` will only match if `thisOp.retain` is `undefined`, whereas `null` will match if `thisOp.retain` is either `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` checks for strict equality, so it will only match if `thisOp.retain` is not `null`. This means that if `thisOp.retain` is `undefined`, it will not match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` checks for the type of the operand, so it will only match if `thisOp.retain` is not `undefined`. This means that if `thisOp.retain` is `null`, it will not match
