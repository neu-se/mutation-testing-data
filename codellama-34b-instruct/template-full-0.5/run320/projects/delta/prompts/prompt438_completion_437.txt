  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases where `nextOp.retain` is a string, but the original code would not have handled it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but this replacement checks if it is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain cases where `nextOp.retain` is an object, but the original code would not have handled it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain
