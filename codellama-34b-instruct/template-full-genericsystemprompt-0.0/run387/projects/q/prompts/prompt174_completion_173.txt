  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be applied to the `line` variable, which is a string, and the number `1`, resulting in a concatenated string `"line1"` instead of the expected incremented line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would be applied to the `line` variable, which is a string, and the number `1`, resulting in a concatenated string `"line-1"` instead of the expected decremented line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would be applied to the `line` variable, which is a string, and the number `2`, resulting in a concatenated string `"line2"` instead of the expected doubled line number.

DONE.
