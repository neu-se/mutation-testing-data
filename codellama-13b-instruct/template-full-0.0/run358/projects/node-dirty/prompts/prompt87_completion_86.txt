  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of an array, while the `pop` method removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array containing the elements from the specified start index to the end of the original array, while the `pop` method removes the last element of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes the element at the specified index from an array, while the `pop` method removes the last element of an array.

DONE.
