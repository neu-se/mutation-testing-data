  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` is a method that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, whereas `thenResolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value.

DONE.
