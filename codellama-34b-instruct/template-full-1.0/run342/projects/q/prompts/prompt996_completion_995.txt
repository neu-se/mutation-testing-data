  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is not called, which means that the Node.js-style callback specified by `nodeback` will never be called, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is not called, which means that the Node.js-style callback specified by `nodeback` will never be called, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` will be called with a new Error object, which means that the Node.js-style callback specified by `nodeback` will be called with this error, resulting in a different behavior.

DONE.
