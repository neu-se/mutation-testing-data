  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok` function is called with no arguments, and therefore would cause an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ses.ok` function is called with the argument `true`, which would cause the function to return `true` instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
