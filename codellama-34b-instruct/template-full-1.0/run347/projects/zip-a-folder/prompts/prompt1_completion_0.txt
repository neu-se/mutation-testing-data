  Great, let's get started!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the compression level to 'high', which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression = COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the compression level to 'high', which is not the same as comparing it to 'high'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression != COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the comparison, returning true for all compression levels except 'uncompressed'.

DONE.
