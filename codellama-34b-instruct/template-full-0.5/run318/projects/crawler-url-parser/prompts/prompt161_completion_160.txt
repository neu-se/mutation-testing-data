  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part < pageurl_without_last_part

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for equality, while this new code fragment is checking for less than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part != pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different
