  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass any arguments to the `emit` method, while this modified code passes `this._readStream` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', this._writeStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `this._readStream` as an argument to `emit`, while this modified code passes `this._writeStream` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', this._readStream);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `this._writeStream` as an argument to `emit`, while this modified code passes `this._readStream` instead.

DONE.
