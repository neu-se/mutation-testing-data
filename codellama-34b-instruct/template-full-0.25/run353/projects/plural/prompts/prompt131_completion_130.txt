  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the given string or not, while `exec()` method returns an array of matches or null if no match is found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the given string or not, while `=== false` would return the opposite boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because `test()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the given string or not, while `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which would return true if the pattern does not match the given string.

DONE.
