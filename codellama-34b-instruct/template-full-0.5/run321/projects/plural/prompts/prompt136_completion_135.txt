  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is a keyword in JavaScript that returns the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.type.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `type` function on the `Object.prototype` object, which is not the same as the `type` function defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural(obj, num)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `plural` function with the `obj` and `num` arguments, which is not the same as calling the `type` function with no arguments.

DONE.
