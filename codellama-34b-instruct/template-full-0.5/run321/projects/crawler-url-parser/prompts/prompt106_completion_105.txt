  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds a new element to the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets the value of an existing element in the map. If the element does not exist, `set` will add it to the map, but `add` will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes an element from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets the value of an existing element in the map. If the element does not exist, `set` will add it to the map, but `delete` will do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all elements from the
