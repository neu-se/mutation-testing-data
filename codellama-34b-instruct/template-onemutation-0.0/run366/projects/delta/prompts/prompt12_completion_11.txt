  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not undefined, but the new code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not null. This could cause the function to behave differently if `a[key]` is null.

DONE.
