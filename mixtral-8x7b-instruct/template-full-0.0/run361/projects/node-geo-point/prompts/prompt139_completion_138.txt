 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.round(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjusted longitude value would be rounded to the nearest integer, which may not be the desired precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.longitude * precision
