  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is not the same as `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is not the same as `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest` is not the same as an empty string.

DONE.
