Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.apply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` does not handle the arguments in the same way as `fapply`, which is specifically designed for Node-style callbacks, potentially leading to incorrect argument passing and failure to resolve the promise correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(deferred.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `then` directly would not pass the arguments to the callback function as expected, and it would not handle the Node-style callback pattern, leading to a promise that resolves without invoking the intended callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs.slice(0, -1))
```
This would result in different behavior because slicing off the last argument (the callback resolver) would prevent the promise from being resolved correctly, causing the promise to hang indefinitely or reject without a proper resolution.

DONE.
