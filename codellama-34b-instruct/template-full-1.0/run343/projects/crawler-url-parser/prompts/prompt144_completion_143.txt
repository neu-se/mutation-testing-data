  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/
```
This would result in different behavior because "/" matches any single character, while the original fragment "/index\.[a-z]+$/" matches only lowercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/index\.[A-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement fragment matches only uppercase letters, while the original fragment matches both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement fragment matches any string that starts with "/index." and ends with a lowercase letter, while the original fragment matches any string that ends with "index." and followed by one or more lowercase letters.

DONE.
