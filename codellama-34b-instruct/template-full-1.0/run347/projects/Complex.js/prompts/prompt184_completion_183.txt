  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and only then checks if `a` is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is greater than `b` and only then checks if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if the product of `a` and `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is greater than 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `b` is
