Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to the length of the URL string, which is a number, and does not check if the URL starts with 'https', leading to incorrect request handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes whitespace from the end of the URL string instead of the beginning, potentially causing the URL to be incorrectly evaluated for its protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a method that does not execute (missing parentheses), resulting in a function reference instead of the actual string value, which would cause the protocol check to fail.

DONE.
