  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the square root of `a^2 + 1` from `a`, whereas the original code fragment adds it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by the square root of `a^2 + 1`, whereas the original code fragment adds it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `a` by the square root of `a^2 + 1`, whereas the original code fragment adds it.

DONE.
