  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the larger of the two lengths, rather than the smaller one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the absolute difference between the two lengths, rather than the smaller one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the smaller of the two lengths, rather than the larger one.

DONE.
