  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code iterates over the keys of the `policies` object, while the new code iterates over the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code iterates over the keys of the `policies` object, while the new code iterates over the key-value pairs of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code iterates over the values of the `policies` object, while the new code iterates over the keys.

DONE.
