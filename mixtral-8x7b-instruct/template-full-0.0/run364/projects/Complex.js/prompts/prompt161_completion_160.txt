 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison for `Infinity / Infinity` would always return `false`, causing incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison for `0 / 0` would always return `false`, causing incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly compare the divisor with `Infinity`, causing incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
