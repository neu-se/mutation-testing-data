  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] === attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first capture group of the regex is equal to the second capture group, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] > attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first capture group of the regex is greater than the second capture group, which is not the intention of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] < attempt2[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first capture group of the regex is less than the second capture group, which is not the intention of the original code.

DONE.
