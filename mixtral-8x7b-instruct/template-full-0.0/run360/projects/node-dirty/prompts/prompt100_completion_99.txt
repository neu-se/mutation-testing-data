 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Corrupted row')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the specific information about the corrupted row, making it harder to debug and identify the problem.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error type from 'error' to 'warning', which might not trigger appropriate error handling in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', {message: `Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error format from an Error object to a plain object, which might not be properly handled by the error handling code expecting an Error object.

DONE.
