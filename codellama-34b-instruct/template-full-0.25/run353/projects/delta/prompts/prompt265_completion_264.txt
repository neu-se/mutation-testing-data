  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are different methods of the `retDelta` object, and calling `insert` instead of `delete` would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods of the `retDelta` object, and calling `retain` instead of `delete` would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `compose` and `delete` are different methods of the `retDelta` object, and calling `compose` instead of `delete` would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
