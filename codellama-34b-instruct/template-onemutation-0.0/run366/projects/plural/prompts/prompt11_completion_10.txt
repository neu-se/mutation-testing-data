  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `w.length - 1` to remove the last character of the word, while the new code fragment is using `w.length - 2` to remove the last two characters of the word. This would cause the plural form of words that end in "y" to be incorrect.

DONE.
