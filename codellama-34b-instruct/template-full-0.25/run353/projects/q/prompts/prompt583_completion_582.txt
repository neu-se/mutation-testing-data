  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, whereas `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the code to handle errors differently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a specified reason, whereas `callback` is a function that resolves a promise with a specified value. Using `reject` instead of `callback` would cause the code to reject the promise instead of resolving it, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the message "test", whereas the original code does not throw any errors. Using this code fragment would cause the code to throw an error, potentially leading to unexpected behavior
