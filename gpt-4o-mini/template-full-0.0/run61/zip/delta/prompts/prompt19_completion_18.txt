Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(b)` returns an array of the values of `b`, which would not allow the `reduce` function to iterate over the keys of `b`, leading to incorrect comparisons and potentially missing attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating the keys of both `a` and `b` would cause the `diff` function to compare keys that exist in both objects, potentially leading to false positives in the differences if the same key exists in both objects with different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(b)` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would not work with the `reduce` function as intended, causing the logic to fail in correctly identifying differences between `a` and `b`.

DONE.
