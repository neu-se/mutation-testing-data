  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value used in the calculation would be different, which would lead to an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value used in the calculation would be different, which would lead to an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value used in the calculation would be different, which would lead to an incorrect distance calculation.

DONE.
