  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, rather than just the `retain` property. This could cause the `delta` array to contain unexpected values, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, rather than the entire `otherOp` object. This could cause the `delta` array to contain only the `retain` property, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp.retain, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `retain` property of the `
