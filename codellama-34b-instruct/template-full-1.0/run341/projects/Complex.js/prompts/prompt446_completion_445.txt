  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.floor() always rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas Math.round() rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero if halfway.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.ceil() always rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas Math.round() rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero if halfway.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(x) { return x + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function simply adds 1 to its input, whereas Math.round() and Math.floor() and Math.round() all perform specific rounding operations.

DONE.
