  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.pause` pauses the read stream, while `res.resume` resumes it. If the intention is to consume the response data to free up memory, `res.pause` would not achieve that.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `dest.end` closes the write stream, while `res.resume` does not interact with the write stream at all. If the intention is to free up memory, `dest.end` would not achieve that.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.destroy` closes the read stream and frees up memory, while `res.resume` does not interact with the read stream at all. If the intention is to free up memory, `res.destroy` would be a more appropriate choice.
