  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the property value instead of the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the property value instead of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a null value instead of the object itself.

DONE.
