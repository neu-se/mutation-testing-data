  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` operation to always be 0, regardless of the actual length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anything"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` operation to always be a string, regardless of the actual length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` operation to have a random length, which would change the behavior of the algorithm.

DONE.
