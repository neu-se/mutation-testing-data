  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is a different variable than `options.dest`, and may not have the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.dest + 1` would add 1 to the value of `options.dest`, which may result in a different path being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname(options.dest)` would return the directory name of the `options.dest` path, which may be different from the base name of the file.

DONE.
