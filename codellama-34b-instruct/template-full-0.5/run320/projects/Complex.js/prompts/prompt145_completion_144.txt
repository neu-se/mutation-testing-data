  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isZero']`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when it should have evaluated to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` property is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw an error.

DONE.
