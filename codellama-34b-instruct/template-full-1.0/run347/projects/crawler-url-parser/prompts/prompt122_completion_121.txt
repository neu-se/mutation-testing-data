  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator of keys in the map, rather than an iterator of values.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
[...urlMap]
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator (`...`) is used to convert the map into an array of key-value pairs, rather than an array of just the values.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Array()` constructor is used to create an array from the iterator returned by `values()`.

DONE.
