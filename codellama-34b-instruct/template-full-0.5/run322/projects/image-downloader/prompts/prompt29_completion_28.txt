  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` protocol instead of the `https` protocol, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'httpss'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to use the `httpss` protocol, which is not a valid protocol, and would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` protocol instead of the `https` protocol, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

DONE.
