  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejector` is a different method than `makeNodeResolver`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `undefined`, instead of the expected value.

DONE.
