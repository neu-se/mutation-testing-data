  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would be called with two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would be called with a string value instead of a variable, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would be called with an undefined value instead of a variable, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
