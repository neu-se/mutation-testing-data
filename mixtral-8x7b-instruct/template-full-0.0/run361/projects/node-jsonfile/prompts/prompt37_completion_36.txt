 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['file', str, options]
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an array instead of separate arguments to the `fs.writeFile` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, str, _fs
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `_fs` variable instead of the `fs` variable that might be re-assigned based on the `options.fs` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file, obj, options
