  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` computes the cube root of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` computes the exponential function, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` computes the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` computes the square root.

DONE.
