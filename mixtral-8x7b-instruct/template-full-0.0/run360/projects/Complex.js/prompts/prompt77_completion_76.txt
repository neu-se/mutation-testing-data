 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i = i + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the assignment operator instead of the pre-increment operator, which may affect the loop behavior in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply evaluates the expression without incrementing the value of `i`, which may cause the loop to iterate indefinitely or skip iterations in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
++i;
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the post-increment operator instead of the pre-increment operator, which may affect the loop behavior in the `parse` function.

DONE.
