  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a < b` would be a boolean expression, and `Math.ceil` expects a number as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity, while `Math.ceil` rounds towards positive infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number, while `Math.ceil` computes the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.

DONE.
