  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being incremented, which could cause the `read` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being decremented, which could cause the `read` function to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is being called with a `null` value instead of the expected `end` value.

DONE.
