  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise || isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also consider objects that are promise-like, but not necessarily promises, as promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider fulfilled promises, and would ignore rejected or pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && !isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore rejected promises, but would still consider pending promises.

DONE.
