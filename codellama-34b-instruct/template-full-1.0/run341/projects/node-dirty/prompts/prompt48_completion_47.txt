  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `_flush` method to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) + 1), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with a different argument, which would update the value associated with the key `key` to a different value in the `_data` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key)), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with a different argument, which would update the value associated with the key `key` to a different value in the `_data` map.

DONE.
