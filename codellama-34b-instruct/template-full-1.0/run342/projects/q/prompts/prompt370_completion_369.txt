  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error: progressed");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `_progressed` function, while the modified code fragment would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `_progressed` function, while the modified code fragment would return a new function that does nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `_progressed` function, while the modified code fragment would return a null value.

DONE.
