 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the distance as if the longitude of point2 is 0, regardless of its actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the calculation of the distance, making it unpredictable and inconsistent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the distance as if point1 and point2 have the same longitude value, which is the longitude of the GeoPoint instance where the `calculateDistance` method is called.

DONE.
