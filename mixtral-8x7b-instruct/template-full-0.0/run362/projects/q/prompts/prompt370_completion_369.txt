 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_progressed.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` would be called with `null` as its `this` value, which might cause issues if `_progressed` relies on `this` referring to the correct object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return _progressed + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of `_progressed` plus 1, instead of just calling `_progressed` with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_progressed.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` would be called with `null` as its `this` value, which might cause issues if `_progressed` relies on `this` referring to the correct object. Additionally, `bind` returns a new function, so the behavior would change
