  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` method returns the distance between two `GeoPoint` objects, whereas the `calculateDestination` method returns the destination point given a starting point, a distance, and a bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateBearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method returns the bearing between two `GeoPoint` objects, whereas the `calculateDestination` method returns the destination point given a starting point, a distance, and a bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `random` method returns a random number between 0 and 1, which is not related to the `GeoPoint` objects or the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
