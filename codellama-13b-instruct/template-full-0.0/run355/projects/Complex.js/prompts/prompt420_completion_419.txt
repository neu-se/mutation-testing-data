  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, while the modified code fragment checks if the complex number is zero in the complex plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is infinite, while the modified code fragment checks if the complex number is infinite in the complex plane.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is not a number (NaN), while the modified code fragment checks if the complex number is not a number in the complex plane.

DONE.
