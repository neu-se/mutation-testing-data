  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp`, and it would change the behavior of the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different value than `otherOp`, and it would change the behavior of the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp`, and it would change the behavior of the `transform` method.

DONE.
