  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'^a', 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `^a` matches any string that starts with "a", whereas the original regular expression `/a/` matches any string that contains the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/a/', 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches any string that contains the letter "a", whereas the original regular expression `/a/` matches any string that contains the letter "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\b?a$', 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\b?a$` matches any string that ends with "a", whereas the original regular expression `/a$` matches any string that ends with the letter "a".

DONE.
