 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function expects no arguments when the promise is fulfilled, but `null` is an object in JavaScript, so it would be treated as if a value was passed to the `progressed` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function expects no arguments when the promise is fulfilled, but passing `1` would mean that the `progressed` callback is always called with the argument `1`, which could cause unexpected behavior in code that relies on the `progressed` callback not being called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
