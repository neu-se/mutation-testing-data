```
  i<=tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator would evaluate to true for one extra iteration, potentially leading to an index out of bounds exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  i==tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator would evaluate to false on the last iteration, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  !(i==tokens.length-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would evaluate to true on the last iteration, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
