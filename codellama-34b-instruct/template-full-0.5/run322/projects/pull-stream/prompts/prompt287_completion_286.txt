  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `mapper` is a function that takes one argument, but `data` is not a function, so calling `mapper(data)` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a number, and `data + 1` would result in a different number than `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a number, and `data.toString()` would result in a string representation of the number, which is different from the original behavior of simply returning `data`.

DONE.
