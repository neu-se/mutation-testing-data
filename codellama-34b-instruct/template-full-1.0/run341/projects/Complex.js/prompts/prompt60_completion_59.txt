  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi']` is the angle of the complex number, while `a['r']` is the magnitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['r']
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different variable from `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different operation.

DONE.
