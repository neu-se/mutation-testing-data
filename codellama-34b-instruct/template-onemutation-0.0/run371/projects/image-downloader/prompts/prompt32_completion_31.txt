  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a non-200 status code, while the new code fragment checks for a 404 status code specifically. If the server returns a 404 status code, the original code would still consider the request successful, while the new code would reject the promise with an error.

DONE.
