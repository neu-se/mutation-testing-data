  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the first argument instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle argument instead of the second.

DONE.
