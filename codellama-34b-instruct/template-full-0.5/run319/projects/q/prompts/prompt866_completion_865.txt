  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` is a function call that returns `undefined`, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve()` is a function call that resolves the deferred object, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject()` is a function call that rejects the deferred object, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object.

DONE.
