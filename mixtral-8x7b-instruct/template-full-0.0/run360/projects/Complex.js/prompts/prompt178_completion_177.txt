 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the denominator, potentially leading to incorrect results or exceptions when the denominator is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of the absolute value, which is not equivalent to the original `Math.abs` function. This change would affect the behavior of the code when dealing with negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because it raises e to the power of the argument, which is not the same as calculating the absolute value. This change would lead to incorrect results or exceptions when the argument is negative.

DONE.
