  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone['name']
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` is a function, and calling it with the `name` property would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` expects a timezone name as an argument, and calling it with `undefined` would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` expects a timezone name as an argument, and calling it with `null` would cause an error.

DONE.
