  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return "function" instead of "object", which would cause the condition to evaluate to `false` and the code inside the `if` block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof module` would return "undefined" instead of "object", which would cause the condition to evaluate to `true` and the code inside the `if` block would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return "string" instead of "object", which would cause the condition to evaluate to `false` and the code inside the `if` block would not be executed.

DONE.
