  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `toFixed`, which could cause the adjusted precision to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result of `toFixed`, which could cause the adjusted precision to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of `toFixed` by 2, which could cause the adjusted precision to be incorrect.

DONE.
