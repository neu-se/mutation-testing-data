  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['ge'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ge` method checks if the operand is less than or equal to the matrix size, while the `gt` method checks if the operand is greater than the matrix size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['eq'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eq` method checks for equality, while the `gt` method checks for greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['ne'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ne` method checks for inequality, while the `gt` method checks for greater than.

DONE.
