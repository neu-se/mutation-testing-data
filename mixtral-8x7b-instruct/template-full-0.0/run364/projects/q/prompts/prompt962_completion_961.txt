 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER>.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `arguments` object, which could cause issues if the original `arguments` object is modified later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method to create a new array from the `arguments` object, which could also cause issues if the original `arguments` object is modified later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.slice` method to create a new array from the `arguments` object, which could also cause issues if the original `arguments` object is modified later in the code.

DONE.
