  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `reducer` function expects two arguments, `acc` and `data`, but in the original code, it is being called with `acc` and `data` in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is being called with the arguments in the opposite order than it was in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function is being called with an extra argument, `acc`, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
