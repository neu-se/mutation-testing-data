Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of "person" is "people," but "persons" is a less common and often incorrect pluralization in standard English usage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because it does not change the word at all, returning the singular form instead of the correct plural form "people."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because "peoples" refers to multiple distinct groups of people, which is not the intended pluralization of the word "person."

DONE.
