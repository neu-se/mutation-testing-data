  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first character of the file name and line number, rather than the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second character of the file name and line number, rather than the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire string, but without the first character.

DONE.
