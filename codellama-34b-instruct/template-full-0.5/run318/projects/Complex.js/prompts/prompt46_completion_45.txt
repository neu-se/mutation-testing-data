  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.hasOwnProperty('im') && a.hasOwnProperty('re')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty()` checks if the property is present on the object itself, not on its prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 'im') && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 're')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` checks if the property is present on the object itself, not on its prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a && 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the properties are present on the object itself, not on its prototype chain.

DONE.
