  DONE.  

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z / Complex['PI'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would return a different value, and the `abs` method would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z / Complex['E'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would return a different value, and the `abs` method would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z / (Complex['PI'] / 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method would return a different value, and the `abs` method would throw an error.
