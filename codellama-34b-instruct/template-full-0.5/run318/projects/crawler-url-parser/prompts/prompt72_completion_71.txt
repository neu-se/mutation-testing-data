  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the `base` element, whereas the original code fragment would select the `href` attribute of any `a` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` property of the `base` element, whereas the original code fragment would select the `href` attribute of any `a` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'https://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `href` attribute of the `base` element to `https://example.com`, whereas the original code fragment would select the `href` attribute of any `a` element.

DONE.
