 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `retain` property of the next operation from `otherIter`, which might not exist or have a different value than the original `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next
