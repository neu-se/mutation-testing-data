  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain == "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because "domain" is an object in this context, so the equality operator would always evaluate to false, causing the code in the first if statement to never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain === "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because "domain" is an object in this context, so the strict equality operator would always evaluate to false, causing the code in the first if statement to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain !== "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because "domain" is an object in this context, so the inequality operator would always evaluate to false, causing the code in the first if statement to never execute.

It is important to note that mutation testing is a form of black box testing, where the tester is unaware of the code's implementation details. The goal of mutation testing is to test the test suite's
