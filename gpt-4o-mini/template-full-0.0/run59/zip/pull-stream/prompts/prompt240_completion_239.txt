Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `end` would cause the callback `cb` to receive `null` as the first argument, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the handling of the end condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `end` would indicate that the operation has completed successfully, which could mislead the caller into thinking that the read operation was successful, even if it was not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data` instead of `end` would pass the actual data read as the first argument to the callback `cb`, which could cause confusion if the callback is expecting an end signal instead of data.

DONE.
