  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a reference to the resolved value of the promise, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a reference to the resolved value of the promise, while `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a reference to the resolved value of the promise, while `throw new Error()` will throw an error and reject the promise.

DONE.
