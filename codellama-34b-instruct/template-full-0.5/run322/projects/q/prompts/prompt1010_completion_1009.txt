  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the second argument instead of the first, and the result would be an array instead of a slice of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the length of the `arguments` object minus one instead of the first argument.

DONE.
