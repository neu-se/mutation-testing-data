  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Invalid options')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with the message "Invalid options", whereas the original code would only throw an error with the message "The options.url is required" if the `options.url` property is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` if the `options.url` property is not provided, whereas the original code would return a rejected promise with an error message.

DONE.
