  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be zero, causing the promise to be resolved immediately, rather than after the specified timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be negative, causing the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than after the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be `NaN`, causing the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than after the specified timeout.

DONE.
