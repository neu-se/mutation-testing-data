Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the original value instead of rejecting it, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections if the original value was an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a static string message instead of the actual exception, losing the context of the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled("default value"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a hardcoded "default value" instead of the actual exception, which could mask the error and lead to incorrect program flow.

DONE.
