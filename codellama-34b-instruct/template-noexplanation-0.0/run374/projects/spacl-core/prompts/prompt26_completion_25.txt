  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min < 0
```
This change will cause the `flatten` function to always push a regular expression segment to the `parts` array, even if the `min` variable is less than 0. This will result in a different behavior than the original code, which only pushes a segment if `min` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max < 0
```
This change will cause the `flatten` function to always push a regular expression segment to the `parts` array, even if the `max` variable is less than 0. This will result in a different behavior than the original code, which only pushes a segment if `max` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min > max
```
This change will cause the `flatten` function to always push a regular expression segment to the `parts` array, even if the `min` variable is greater than the `max` variable. This
