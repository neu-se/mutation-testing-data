  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `onAbort` parameter, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` parameter is missing, which could cause the `abortCb` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument `1` is passed to the `abortCb` function, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
