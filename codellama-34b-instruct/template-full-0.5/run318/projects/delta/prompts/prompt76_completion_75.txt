  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `retain` property of the `newOp` object, which is used in the `push` method to determine whether to insert or delete characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `delete` property of the `newOp` object, which is used in the `push` method to determine whether to insert or delete characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `insert` property of the `newOp` object, which is used in the `push` method to determine whether to insert or delete characters.

DONE.
