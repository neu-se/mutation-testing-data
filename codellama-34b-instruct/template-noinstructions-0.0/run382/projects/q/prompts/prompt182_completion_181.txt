  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the portion of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number information that is needed for debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the stack trace, which may not include the file name and line number information that is needed for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second part of the stack trace, which may not include the file name and line number information that is needed for debugging.

DONE.
