  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is different from `cos`, and could potentially cause errors in the calculation of distances and bearings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which is different from `cos`, and could potentially cause errors in the calculation of distances and bearings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant `1` is not related to the calculation of distances and bearings, and could potentially cause errors in the calculation of distances and bearings.

DONE.
