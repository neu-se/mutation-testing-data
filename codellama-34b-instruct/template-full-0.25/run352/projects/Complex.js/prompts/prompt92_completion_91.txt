  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the string, while this new code fragment is adding 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the string, while this new code fragment is adding 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is adding 1 to the string, while this new code fragment is adding the character 'a'.

DONE.
