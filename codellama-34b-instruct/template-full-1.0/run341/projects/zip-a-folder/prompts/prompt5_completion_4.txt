  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zipAFolderOptions` object is checked for a `customWriteStream` property, but the `targetFilePath` is checked for a falsy value, which would result in the `compress` function being called with a `customWriteStream` and no `targetFilePath`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `zipAFolderOptions` object and the `targetFilePath` are checked for falsy values, which would result in the `compress` function being called with no `customWriteStream` and no `targetFilePath`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zipAFolderOptions` object is checked
