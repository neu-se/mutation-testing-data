  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverCountry` returns a country object, while the new code fragment `return null;` returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverCountry` returns a country object, while the new code fragment `return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);` returns a country object with the same properties as the original object, but with different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { ...countries[id], ...options };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deliverCountry` returns a country object, while the new code fragment `return { ...countries[id], ...options };` returns a country object with the same properties as the original object, but with different values and additional properties
