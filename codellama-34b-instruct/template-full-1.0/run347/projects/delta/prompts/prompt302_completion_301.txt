  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be incremented incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be incremented by 2 instead of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be incremented incorrectly.

DONE.
