  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than passing it as a parameter to `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { flush(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that calls `flush` when invoked, rather than passing `flush` as a parameter to `setTimeout`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { setTimeout(flush, 0); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that calls `setTimeout` with `flush` as a parameter, but with a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than immediately.

DONE.
