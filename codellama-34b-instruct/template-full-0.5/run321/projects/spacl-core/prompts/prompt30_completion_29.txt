  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg - acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator to concatenate the segments, while this option uses the `-` operator to subtract the segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg * acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator to concatenate the segments, while this option uses the `*` operator to multiply the segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg / acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `+` operator to concatenate the segments, while this option uses the `/` operator to divide the segments.

DONE.
