  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let [key, val] of this._data.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.entries()` returns an iterator for the key-value pairs in the map, whereas the original code fragment `const [key, val] of this._data` destructures the map into an array of key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let [key, val] of this._data.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.values()` returns an iterator for the values in the map, whereas the original code fragment destructures the map into an array of key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let [key, val] of this._data.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` returns an iterator for the keys in the map, whereas the original code fragment destructures the map into an array of key
