  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the starting position of the search for the newline character, potentially leading to a different index being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the starting position of the search for the newline character, potentially leading to a different index being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the starting position of the search for the newline character, potentially leading to a different index being returned.

DONE.
