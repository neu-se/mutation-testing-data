Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the `state` property of the promise object instead of calling the `inspect()` method, which would lead to an error if `state` is not defined on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the `value` of the promise's inspection result instead of its `state`, which would incorrectly indicate that a fulfilled promise is pending if the value is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state === "fulfilled" || this.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the promise is either fulfilled or rejected, which would incorrectly return `false` for pending promises, thus not accurately reflecting the pending state.

DONE.
