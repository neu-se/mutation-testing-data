Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the caught exception, it logs the exception to the console and continues execution, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q("Error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original exception with a resolved promise containing a string message, which would not propagate the actual error and would lead to misleading success in promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject("Custom error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise with a custom error message instead of the original exception, which could obscure the actual error that occurred and make debugging more difficult.

DONE.
