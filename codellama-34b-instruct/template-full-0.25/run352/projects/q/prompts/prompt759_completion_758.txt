  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the functions in the array is reversed, which would cause the `allResolved` function to be called instead of the `allSettled` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function is not called at all, and the `allResolved` function is called twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled, "allResolved", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function is called twice, and the `allSettled` function is not called at all.

DONE.
