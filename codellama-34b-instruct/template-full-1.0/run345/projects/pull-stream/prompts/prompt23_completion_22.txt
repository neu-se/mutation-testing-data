  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the args array instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the last element of the args array instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[read.indexOf('something')]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the element in the args array that contains the string 'something' instead of the first element.

DONE.
