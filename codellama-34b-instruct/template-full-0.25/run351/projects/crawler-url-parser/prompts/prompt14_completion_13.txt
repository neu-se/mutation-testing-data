  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the "https://" protocol to the beginning of the URL, even if it already had a protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http://" protocol from the beginning of the URL, even if it was not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL to "ftp://", even if it was not present.

DONE.
