  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the length of the peeked operation by 1, potentially causing the next operation to be skipped or leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length of the peeked operation by 1, potentially causing the next operation to be repeated or leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, potentially causing the next operation to be repeated twice or leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
