Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the "get" operation instead of the intended "post" operation, which changes the expected behavior of the method invocation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args, "extraArg"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which may lead to unexpected results or errors when the receiving function does not handle the additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args[0]]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first argument of the `args` array instead of the entire array, potentially causing the invoked method to receive insufficient parameters.

DONE.
