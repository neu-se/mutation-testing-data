  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the segments with a dollar sign (`$`) as the separator, while the modified code fragment concatenates the segments with an empty string (`''`) as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the segments with a dollar sign (`$`) as the separator, while the modified code fragment concatenates the segments with a space (` `) as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(acc, seg) => seg + acc, ','
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the segments with a dollar sign (`$`) as the separator, while the modified code fragment concatenates the segments with a comma (`,`) as the separator.

DONE.
