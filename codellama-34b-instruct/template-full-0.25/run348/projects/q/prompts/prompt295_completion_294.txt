  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, causing the `reject` function to be called with `null` as the reason for rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, causing the `reject` function to be called with `undefined` as the reason for rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"error"` is a truthy value, and the `if` statement would evaluate to `true`, causing the `reject` function to be called with `"error"` as the reason for rejection.

DONE.
