  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the separator and then filters out any empty strings from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the empty string as the separator, which would result in an array of single characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment spl
