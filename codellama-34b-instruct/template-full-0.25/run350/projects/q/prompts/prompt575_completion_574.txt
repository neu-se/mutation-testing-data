  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `next` argument, which would cause the generator to continue iterating instead of stopping at the current yield point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `throw` argument, which would cause the generator to throw an exception instead of returning a promise for the return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next", "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `next` and `throw` arguments, which would cause the generator to continue iterating and throw an exception if the generator is exha
