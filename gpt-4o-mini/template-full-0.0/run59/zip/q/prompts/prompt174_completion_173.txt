Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all lines in the stack trace, regardless of whether they are internal frames or not, potentially leading to a cluttered and less useful stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push("Error: " + line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend "Error: " to each line in the stack trace, altering the format of the output and potentially confusing users who expect a standard stack trace format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push("Filtered: " + line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the content of the stack trace lines to indicate they have been filtered, which could mislead users into thinking that the lines are not part of the original error stack.

DONE.
