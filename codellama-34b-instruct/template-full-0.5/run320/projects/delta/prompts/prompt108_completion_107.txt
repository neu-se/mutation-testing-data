  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the wrong index value, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the wrong index value, which could cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the wrong index value, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
