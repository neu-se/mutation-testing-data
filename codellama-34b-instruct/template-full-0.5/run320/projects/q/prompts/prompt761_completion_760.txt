  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.length` is a different value than `promises`, which would cause the `array_map` function to operate on a different set of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.slice(1)` returns a new array with the first element removed, which would cause the `array_map` function to operate on a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.reverse()` returns a new array with the elements in reverse order, which would cause the `array_map` function to operate on a different set of values.

DONE.
