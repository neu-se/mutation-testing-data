  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because, unlike `length`, `size` is not a property of arrays, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because, unlike `length`, `size` is not a property of arrays, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because, unlike `length`, `size` is not a property of arrays, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
