  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null, this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null event instead of the expected 'load' event, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'load' event with an incorrect size value, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'load' event with a doubled size value, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
