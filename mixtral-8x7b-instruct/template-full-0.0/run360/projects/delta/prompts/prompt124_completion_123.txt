 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, and checking for `null` only ensures there is a next operation, not that it is within the specified range.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.hasNext() && iter.peek() !== null
