 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.async(makeGenerator).call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` inside the `async` function, which could lead to unexpected results if the generator function relies on the original value of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.async(makeGenerator)(null)
