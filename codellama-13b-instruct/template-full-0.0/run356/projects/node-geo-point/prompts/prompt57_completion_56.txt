  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the latitude of the second point instead of the first point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the cosine of the latitude of the first point instead of the latitude of the first point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be using the sine of the latitude of the first point instead of the latitude of the first point.

DONE.
