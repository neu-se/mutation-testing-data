  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip the current op and move to the next one, potentially causing the test to fail if it was expecting to operate on the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move back to the previous op, potentially causing the test to fail if it was expecting to operate on the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return a null op, potentially causing the test to fail if it was expecting to operate on a valid op.

DONE.
