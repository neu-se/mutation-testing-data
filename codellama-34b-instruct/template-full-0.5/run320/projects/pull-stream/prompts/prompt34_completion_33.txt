  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull` function would be called with the second argument instead of the first, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull` function would be called with the last argument instead of the first, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pull` function would be called with a random argument instead of the first, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
