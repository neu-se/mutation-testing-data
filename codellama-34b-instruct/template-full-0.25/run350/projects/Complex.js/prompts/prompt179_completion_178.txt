  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return the absolute value of `a`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return the absolute value of `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Math.abs()` function to always return the absolute value of `a + b`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
