  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.test` is a function, and `test.test + 1` is a string, which would cause the code to fail at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `test.test` is a function that takes a single argument, and `test.test(data)` would cause the code to call the function with the `data` argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not the same object as `test`, and `data.test` would potentially reference a different function or property than `test.test`.

DONE.
