  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `null` as the second argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
