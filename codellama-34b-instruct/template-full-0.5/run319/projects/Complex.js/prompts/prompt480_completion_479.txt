  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value returned by `isNaN`, causing the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the input is not a number, instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the input is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if the input is a number. Replacing `isNaN` with `isFinite` would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `true` when the input is a finite number, instead of `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the input is infinite, whereas `isNaN` checks if the input is a number. Replacing `is
