  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver() + 1` to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver() + " ");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the result of `deferred.makeNodeResolver() + " "` to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the function to be called with a different set of arguments than intended.
