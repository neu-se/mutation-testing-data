  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always throw an error, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always cancel the timeout, regardless of the input.

DONE.
