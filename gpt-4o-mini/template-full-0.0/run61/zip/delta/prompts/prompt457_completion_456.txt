Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation in the list instead of the current operation, potentially causing the `rest` method to behave incorrectly by skipping the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert `null` into the returned array instead of the current operation, which could lead to unexpected results when processing the rest of the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the `insert` property of the current operation instead of the entire operation object, which could lead to loss of important information such as `retain` or `delete` properties.

DONE.
