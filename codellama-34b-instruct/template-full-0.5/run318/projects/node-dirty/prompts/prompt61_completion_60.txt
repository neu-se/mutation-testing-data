  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would close the read stream immediately, whereas `destroy()` would only close the stream when all data has been flushed to the underlying system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroySoon()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroySoon()` would close the read stream as soon as possible, whereas `end()` would only close the stream when all data has been flushed to the underlying system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pause()` would temporarily suspend the read stream, whereas `end()` would close the stream permanently.

DONE.
