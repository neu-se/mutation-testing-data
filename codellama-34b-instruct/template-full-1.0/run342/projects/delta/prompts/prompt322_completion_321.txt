  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.filter((op) => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array, while `base.filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.map((op) => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array, while `base.map` returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.reduce((acc, op) => acc + op.insert, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.slice` returns a shallow copy of the original array, while `base.reduce` returns a single value that is the result of accumulating all the elements in the calling array using a provided function
