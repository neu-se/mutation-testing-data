  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the current element without moving the iterator forward, which would cause the loop to never terminate if the length of `ops` is non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext()` returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, so the loop would never terminate if `ops` is non-empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the current element and increments the iterator, which would cause the loop to advance and eventually terminate if `ops` is non-empty.

DONE.
