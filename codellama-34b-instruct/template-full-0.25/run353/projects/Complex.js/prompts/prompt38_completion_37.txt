  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 || _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are less than 3000, while this new code fragment checks if either `_a` or `_b` is greater than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a === 3000 && _b === 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are less than 3000, while this new code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are equal to 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are less
