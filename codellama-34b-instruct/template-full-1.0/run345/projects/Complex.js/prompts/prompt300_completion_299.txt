  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `*` operator, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `a` is multiplied by 10, which would change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is subtracted from the `a` variable, which would change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
