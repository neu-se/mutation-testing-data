Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.unshift(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `nextOp` to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end, altering the order of operations in the `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value into the `ops` array instead of the `nextOp`, which could lead to unexpected results when processing the `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp, nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `nextOp` twice into the `ops` array, effectively duplicating the operation instead of adding it once, which could lead to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

DONE.
