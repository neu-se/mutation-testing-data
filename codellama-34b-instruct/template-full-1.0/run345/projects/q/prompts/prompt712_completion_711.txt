  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of the operand, whereas the original code fragment `[]` is an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that indicates the absence of any object value, whereas the original code fragment `[]` is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is a keyword that refers to the current execution context, whereas the original code fragment `[]` is an empty array.

DONE.
