  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator (<=), which allows for the possibility that a is zero, but the new code fragment only allows for the exact value of zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for the possibility that a is zero, but the new code fragment explicitly excludes the value of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < -10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for the possibility that a is any value less than or equal to zero, but the new code fragment only allows for values less than -10.

DONE.
