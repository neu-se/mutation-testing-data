  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ data: data }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with a `data` property, while the original code fragment returned the `data` value directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `data` value incremented by 1, while the original code fragment returned the `data` value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `data` array, while the original code fragment returned the `data` value directly.

DONE.
