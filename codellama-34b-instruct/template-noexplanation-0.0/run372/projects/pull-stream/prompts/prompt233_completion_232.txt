  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This change will cause the `test` function to always return `false`, even if the input data is valid. This will cause the `next` function to loop indefinitely, which will likely cause the program to crash or freeze.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This change will cause the `test` function to always return `false`, even if the input data is valid. This will cause the `next` function to loop indefinitely, which will likely cause the program to crash or freeze.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This change will cause the `test` function to always return `true`, even if the input data is invalid. This will cause the `next` function to loop indefinitely, which will likely cause the program to crash or freeze.

DONE.
