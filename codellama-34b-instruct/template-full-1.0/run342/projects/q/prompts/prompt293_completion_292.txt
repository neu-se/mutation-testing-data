  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object would no longer have the `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object would still have the `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` properties, but they would be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object would have a randomly generated `resolve`, `reject`, and `notify` property, which could cause the promise to resolve or reject unexpectedly.

DONE.
