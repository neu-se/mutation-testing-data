  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array from the beginning to `this.index`, instead of from `this.index` to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1, this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array from the end to `this.index`, instead of from `this.index` to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `ops` array from `this.index + 1` to the end of the array, instead of from `this.index` to the end of the array.

DONE.
