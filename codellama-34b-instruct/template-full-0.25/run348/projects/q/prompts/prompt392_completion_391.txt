  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is called on the `progressed` argument, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called on the `progressed` argument with a start index of 1, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
