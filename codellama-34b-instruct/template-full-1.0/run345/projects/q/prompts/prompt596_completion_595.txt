  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a built-in JavaScript object that contains the arguments passed to the current function, whereas `args` is a separate variable that may or may not have the same value as `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods, whereas `self` may have properties and methods that are used in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods, whereas `self` may have properties and methods that are used in the function.

DONE.
