  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would not be called, and the `unhandledRejections` array would not be reset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with `true` as an argument, which would cause the `unhandledRejections` array to be reset, even if it was not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with `null` as an argument, which would cause the `unhandledRejections` array to be reset, even if it was not empty.

DONE.
