  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the country object, even if it doesn't exist in the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[id] && getCountry(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the country object if it doesn't exist in the `countries` object and the `getCountry` function returns a non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || getCountry(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country object if it exists in the `countries` object, or if it doesn't exist, it would return the result of the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
