  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callback and errback arguments is reversed, which could cause the program to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback argument is missing, which could cause the program to behave differently if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback argument is missing, which could cause the program to behave differently if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
