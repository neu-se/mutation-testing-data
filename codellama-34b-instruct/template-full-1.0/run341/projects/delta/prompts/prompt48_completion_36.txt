  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType != Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false for the third condition, even if embedType is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof embedType !== 'string' || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for the first condition if embedType is not a string, and false for the second condition if embedType is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0] && embedType != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false if embedType is null or undefined, and only return true if it is not null or undefined and not equal to the key at index 0 in the object returned by Object.keys(b).

DONE.
