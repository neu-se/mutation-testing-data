  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if the callback returned a promise that was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not return a rejected promise if the callback returned a promise that was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error(reason));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not return a rejected promise with a new error object if the callback returned a promise that was rejected.

DONE.
