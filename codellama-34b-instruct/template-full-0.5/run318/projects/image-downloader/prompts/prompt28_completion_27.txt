  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, whereas `trimLeft()` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This means that the resulting URL may be different, and the request may fail if the URL is not properly formatted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first character of the string, which may change the meaning of the URL. For example, if the URL is `https://example.com`, then `url.slice(1)` would result in `https://example.com/`, which is a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('https') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string. If the URL does not contain the substring
