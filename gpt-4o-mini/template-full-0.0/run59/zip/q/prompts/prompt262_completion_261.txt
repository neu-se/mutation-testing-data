Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = fulfill(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the result of `fulfill(value)` to `resolvedPromise`, which may not properly handle the promise resolution process as intended, potentially leading to incorrect state management.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `deferred.resolve(value)` instead of `become(Q(value))`, which means it would not properly handle the transition of the promise state and could lead to unresolved promises being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value + " modified"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value being passed to `become` by appending " modified" to it, which could change the expected resolution value of the promise, leading to unexpected results in promise consumers.

DONE.
