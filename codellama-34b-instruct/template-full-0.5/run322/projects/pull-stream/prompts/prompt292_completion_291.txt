  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the item through when it is seen for the second time, while the new code fragment would pass the item through only when it is seen for the first time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the item through when it is seen for the second time, while the new code fragment would pass the item through only when it is seen for the first time or when it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the item through when it is seen for the second time, while the new code fragment would pass the item through only when it is seen for the first time or when it is null.

DONE.
