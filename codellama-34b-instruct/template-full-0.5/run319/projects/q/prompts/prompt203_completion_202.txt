  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"at"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "at" operator is used to concatenate strings, whereas the "@" operator is used to access object properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"in"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "in" operator is used to check if a property exists in an object, whereas the "@" operator is used to access object properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "#" operator is used to access the length of an array, whereas the "@" operator is used to access object properties.

DONE.
