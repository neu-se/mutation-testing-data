  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to `dispatch` instead of the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to `dispatch` instead of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the remaining arguments to `dispatch` after the first one instead of the entire `args` array.

DONE.
