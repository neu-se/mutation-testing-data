  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because cos(θ) is always positive, while atan2(y, x) is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because sin(θ) is always between -1 and 1, while sin(θ) + 1 can be greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(x, y) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because atan2(x, y) and atan2(x, y) + 1 have different ranges.

DONE.
