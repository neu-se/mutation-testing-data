  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) + deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude values of both points, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) - deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude values of both points, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude) * deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude values of both points, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
