  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` has a higher precedence than `,` in JavaScript, so `acc + data` would evaluate to a different value than `acc, data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - data
```
This would result in different behavior because `-` has a higher precedence than `,` in JavaScript, so `acc - data` would evaluate to a different value than `acc, data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because `*` has a higher precedence than `,` in JavaScript, so `acc * data` would evaluate to a different value than `acc, data`.

DONE.
