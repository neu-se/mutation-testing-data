  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` would allow any remaining data to be flushed before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end(null)` would immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` would allow any remaining data to be flushed before closing the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `end(() => {})` would immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` would allow any remaining data to be flushed before closing the stream.

DONE.
