  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This change will cause the code to use the semicolon operator instead of the comma operator, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This change will cause the code to use the bitwise OR operator instead of the comma operator, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'&'
```
This change will cause the code to use the bitwise AND operator instead of the comma operator, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
