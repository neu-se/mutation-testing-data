Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is not a method that exists on a `Map` (which is likely the type of `_queue`), and thus it would throw an error instead of removing an item from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all elements from the queue, rather than just removing a specific key, which could lead to unintended data loss.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` would attempt to add or update a key in the queue instead of deleting it, which would cause the queue to grow instead of shrink, potentially leading to memory issues or incorrect processing of queued items.

DONE.
