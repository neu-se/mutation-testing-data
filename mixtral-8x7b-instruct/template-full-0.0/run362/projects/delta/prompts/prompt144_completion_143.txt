 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, ignoring the argument provided. This could lead to incorrect length calculations and improper iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `null`, which is not a number and would cause issues in the comparison with `firstLeft` and `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength(<any>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the number type with the `any` type, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the comparison with `firstLeft` and `length`.

DONE.
