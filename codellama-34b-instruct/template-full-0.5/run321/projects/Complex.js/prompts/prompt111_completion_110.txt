  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the operand is NaN, while `!isNaN` returns `false` if the operand is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` if the operand is a finite number, while `isNaN` returns `false` if the operand is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a built-in function that returns `true` if the operand is NaN, while `isNaN` is a global function that returns `true` if the operand is NaN or a string that can be converted to NaN.

DONE.
