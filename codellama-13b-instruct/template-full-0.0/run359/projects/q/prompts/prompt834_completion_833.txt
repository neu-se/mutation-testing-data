  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes three arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes no arguments. This would cause the code to fail at runtime with an error message indicating that the function is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes three arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes no arguments. This would cause the code to fail at runtime with an error message indicating that the function is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that takes three arguments, while the buggy code fragment is a function that takes no arguments. This would cause the code to fail at runtime with an error message indicating that the function is not defined.

DONE.
