  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinks` object is used instead of the `sources` object, which could cause the program to behave differently when handling data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throughs` object is used instead of the `sources` object, which could cause the program to behave differently when handling data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.map(function(source) { return source.toUpperCase(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sources` object is transformed into an array of uppercase strings, which could cause the program to behave differently when handling data.

DONE.
