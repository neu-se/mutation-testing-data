  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise as an argument and returns a new promise that resolves with the result of the original promise, while `universalify.fromCallback` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that takes a callback as an argument and calls the original function with the callback as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a function that takes a promise as an argument and returns a new promise that resolves with the result of the original promise, while `universalify.fromPromise()` is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) that takes no arguments and returns a new promise that resolves with the result of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.
