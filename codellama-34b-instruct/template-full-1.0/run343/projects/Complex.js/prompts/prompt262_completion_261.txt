  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in a different derivative calculation, as the product of `a` and `b` is not the same as the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in a different derivative calculation, as the difference of `a` and `b` is not the same as the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in a different derivative calculation, as the ratio of `b` to `a` is not the same as the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
