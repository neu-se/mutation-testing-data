  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fcall(value).thenResolve(value)

This would result in different behavior because `Q(callback).fcall(value)` would create a new promise that is resolved with the return value of `callback(value)`, which may not be the same as the original promise returned by `then()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fcall(value).thenReject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(callback).fcall(value)` would create a new promise that is rejected with the return value of `callback(value)`, which may not be the same as the original promise returned by `then()`.
