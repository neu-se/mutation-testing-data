  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) * Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation is changed to the division operation, which would alter the results of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation is changed to the subtraction operation, which would alter the results of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation is changed to the subtraction operation, which would alter the results of the calculation.

DONE.
