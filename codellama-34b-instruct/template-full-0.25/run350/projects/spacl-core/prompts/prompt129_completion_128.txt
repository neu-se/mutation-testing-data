  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to terminate earlier than expected or to miss certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would restart from the beginning of the array instead of continuing from the current index, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to repeat certain elements indefinitely.

DONE.
