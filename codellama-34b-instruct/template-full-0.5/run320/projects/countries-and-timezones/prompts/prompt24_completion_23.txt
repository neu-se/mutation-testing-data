  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because `dstOffset` is a different variable than `utcOffset`, and it may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `utcOffset` value, which could change the resulting offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getNumStr` function with the `utcOffset` value, which could change the resulting offset string.

DONE.
