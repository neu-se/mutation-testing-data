  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the argument is a string that is equal to the string "number", rather than checking if the argument is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the argument is not a string that is equal to the string "number", rather than checking if the argument is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the argument is not a number, rather than checking if the argument is a number.

DONE.
