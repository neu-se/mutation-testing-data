  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(thisIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is not defined in the `OpIterator` class, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
