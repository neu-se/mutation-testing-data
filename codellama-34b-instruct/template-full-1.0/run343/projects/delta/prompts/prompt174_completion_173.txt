  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the `while` loop condition `length > 0` would always be true, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in the loop terminating prematurely because the loop condition `length > 0` would be false, even though there may be more ops to process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in the loop processing only one op, because the loop condition `length > 0` would be true only for the first iteration, and `length` would be decremented to 0 on the first iteration, causing the loop to terminate.

DONE.
