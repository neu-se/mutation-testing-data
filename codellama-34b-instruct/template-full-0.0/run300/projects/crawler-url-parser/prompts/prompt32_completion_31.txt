  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'https://' would ensure that the URL starts with a secure protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'http://www.' would ensure that the URL starts with a protocol and includes the 'www.' subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to ensure that the URL starts with a protocol, while 'http://example.com' would ensure that the URL starts with a protocol and includes the 'example.com' domain.

DONE.
