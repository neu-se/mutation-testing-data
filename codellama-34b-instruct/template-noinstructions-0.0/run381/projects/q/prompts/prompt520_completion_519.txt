  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the reason for rejection, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the reason for rejection, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the reason for rejection, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
