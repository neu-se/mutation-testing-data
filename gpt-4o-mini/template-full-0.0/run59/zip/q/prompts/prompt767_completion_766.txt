Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Promise rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of silently ignoring the rejection, it would throw an error, causing the promise chain to be interrupted and potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` would not fulfill the promise with a value, which could lead to unexpected results when the promise is resolved, as it would not provide the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject("Error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly reject the promise with a specific error message, causing the promise to be in a rejected state instead of being fulfilled, which would affect any subsequent `.then()` or `.catch()` handlers.

DONE.
