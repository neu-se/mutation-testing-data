This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `unhandledReasons` array to be reset to an empty array, which would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return an empty array instead of the actual unhandled reasons.

```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, 1);

This would result in different behavior because it would cause the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array to be removed, which would cause the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return
