  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` would evaluate to a complex number, while the new code fragment `x + 1` would evaluate to a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` would evaluate to a complex number, while the new code fragment `x * 2` would evaluate to a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` would evaluate to a complex number, while the new code fragment `x / 2` would evaluate to a real number.

DONE.
