  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData.length` is a number, while `otherData` is an object. In the original code, `otherData` is used as an object, and its properties are accessed. Replacing it with `otherData.length` would cause the code to fail, as `length` is not a property of a number.
