 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a word boundary after `o`, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check for the end of the string (`$`), which may cause it to match incorrectly within a word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]o|o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `o` at the end of the string (`o$`) separately, which is not present in the original code fragment. This may cause it to match incorrectly when `o` is not at the end of the string.

DONE.
