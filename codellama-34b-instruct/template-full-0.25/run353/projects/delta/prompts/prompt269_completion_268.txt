  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one character from the delta, whereas the original code would chop the delta, which would remove any trailing retain ops with a length of zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one character from the delta, whereas the original code would chop the delta, which would remove any trailing retain ops with a length of zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1, { bold: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one character from the delta and apply the bold attribute to it, whereas the original code would chop the delta, which would remove any trailing retain ops with a length of zero.

DONE.
