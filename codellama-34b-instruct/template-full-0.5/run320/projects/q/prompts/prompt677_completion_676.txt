  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, and could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` is being replaced with a single argument, which could cause issues with the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` is being replaced with a second argument, which could cause issues with the function's behavior.

DONE.
