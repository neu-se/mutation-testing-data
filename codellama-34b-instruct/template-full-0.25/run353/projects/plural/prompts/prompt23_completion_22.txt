  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would produce a word that ends in "i" (e.g., "nucleus" becomes "nuclei"), while the new code fragment would produce a word that ends in "es" (e.g., "nucleus" becomes "nucleuses").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would produce a word that ends in "i" (e.g., "nucleus" becomes "nuclei"), while the new code fragment would produce a word that ends in "us" (e.g., "nucleus" becomes "nucleuses").
