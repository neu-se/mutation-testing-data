Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !data }
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the callback to be invoked only when the data is falsy, which is the opposite of the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data === null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to only trigger the callback when the data is exactly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the data is greater than zero, which would only call the callback for positive numbers, potentially missing valid data that is zero or negative.

DONE.
