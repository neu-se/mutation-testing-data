  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative cosine function would be used instead of the positive cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would be used instead of the cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the tangent function would be used instead of the cosine function.

DONE.
