  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|indices/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "appendix" and "index" with the "i" flag, while the new code fragment also matches "indices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|indices|indices\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "appendix" and "index" with the "i" flag, while the new code fragment also matches "indices" and "indices" at the end of a word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index|indices|indices\b|indices\B/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "appendix" and "index" with the "i" flag, while the new code fragment also matches "indices" and "indices" at the end
