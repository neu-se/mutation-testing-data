Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `then` method instead of `spread`, which does not unpack the array of values into separate arguments for the `fulfilled` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all().then(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `all()` which expects an array of promises and resolves them all, rather than spreading the values of a promised array into the fulfillment callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).map(fulfilled, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` is not a valid method in this context and would likely throw an error, whereas `spread` is designed to handle the fulfillment of promises and pass the values correctly.

DONE.
