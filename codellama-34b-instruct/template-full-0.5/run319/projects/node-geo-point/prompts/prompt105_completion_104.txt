  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 181) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 181 is different from the original 180, which would result in a slightly different calculation and a different value for the x coordinate of the tile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude - 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 180 is different from the original 180, which would result in a slightly different calculation and a different value for the x coordinate of the tile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 360) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 360 is different from the original 36
