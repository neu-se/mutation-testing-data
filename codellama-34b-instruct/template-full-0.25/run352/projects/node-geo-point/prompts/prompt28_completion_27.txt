  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` returns the sine of a number, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos()` returns the cosine of a number, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

DONE.
