  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error only if the row is empty, while this new code fragment emits an error for every row.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db: ' + rowStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error only if the row is corrupted, while this new code fragment emits an error for every row.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error only if the row is empty, while this new code fragment emits an error for every row.

DONE.
