  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'drain' is not an error event, and the callback function would not be called with an error argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'close' is not an error event, and the callback function would not be called with an error argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'finish' is not an error event, and the callback function would not be called with an error argument.

DONE.
