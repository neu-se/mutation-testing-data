  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.nextLength` is not a valid property, but `otherIter.peekLength` is a valid property of the `OpIterator` object. Therefore, if the `nextLength` property is used, the code would crash with a `ReferenceError` indicating that the property is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sequence.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `sequence.length` is the length of the `sequence` variable, which is an object. The `peekLength` method returns the length of the current operation in the sequence, which is an integer. Therefore, if the `sequence.length` property is used, the code would behave differently because it would be comparing the length of the sequence to the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` is an object,
