  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now checking the current URL string for illegal characters, rather than the base URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now checking the base URL string for legal characters, rather than illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is now checking both the base URL string and the current URL string for illegal characters, and returning null if either of them contains illegal characters.

DONE.
