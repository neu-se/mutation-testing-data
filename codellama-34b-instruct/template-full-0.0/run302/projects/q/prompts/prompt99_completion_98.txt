  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time, potentially causing an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, potentially causing the program to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index == length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, potentially causing the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
