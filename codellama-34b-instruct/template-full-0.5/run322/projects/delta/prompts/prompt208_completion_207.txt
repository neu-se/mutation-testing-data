  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is not defined on the `Delta` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new `Delta` instance onto the `delta` array, which would cause the `concat` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(new Delta());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate a new `Delta` instance onto the `delta` array, which would cause the `concat` method to return a different result.

DONE.
