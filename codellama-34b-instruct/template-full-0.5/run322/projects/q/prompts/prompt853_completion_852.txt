  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a function that cancels the repeated execution of a function, whereas `clearTimeout` is a function that cancels the execution of a function after a specified amount of time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearImmediate` is a function that cancels the execution of a function that was scheduled to be executed immediately, whereas `clearTimeout` is a function that cancels the execution of a function after a specified amount of time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to clear a timeout with an ID that is one greater than the actual timeout ID, which would not actually clear the timeout and would result in the function being executed after the specified amount of time.

DONE.
