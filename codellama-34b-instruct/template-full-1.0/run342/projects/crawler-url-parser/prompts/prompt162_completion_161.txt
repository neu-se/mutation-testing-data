  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `part_count_diff` is less than 1, the `if` statement would be evaluated to `true`, even if the `linkurl_path` does not include the `pageurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `part_count_diff` is not equal to 1, the `if` statement would be evaluated to `true`, even if the `linkurl_path` does not include the `pageurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff - 1 < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when the `part_count_diff` is less than 1, the `if` statement would be evaluated to `true`, even if the `linkurl_path` does not include the `
