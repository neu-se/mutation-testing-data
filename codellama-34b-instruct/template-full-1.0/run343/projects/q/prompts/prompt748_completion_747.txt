  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise would be rejected, which is the opposite of what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` expects an argument, but `null` is not a valid argument for that method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` expects an argument, but `undefined` is not a valid argument for that method.

DONE.
