  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, so if the `src` is a glob, it would not be archived.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `src` is a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `src` is not a glob.

DONE.
