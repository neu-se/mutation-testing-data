  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the provided function to each element of the `ops` array and return a new array containing the results, whereas the original code fragment `this.ops.filter` filters the `ops` array based on the provided function and returns a new array containing the elements that passed the filter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the provided function to each element of the `ops` array and return a new value created by combining the results, whereas the original code fragment `this.ops.filter` filters the `ops` array based on the provided function and returns a new array containing the elements that passed the filter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a portion of the `ops` array based on the start and end indices, whereas the original code fragment
