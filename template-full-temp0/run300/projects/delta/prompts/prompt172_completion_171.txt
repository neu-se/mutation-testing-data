  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to be used instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be subtracted from the result of `otherIter.peekLength()`, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` iterator to be used instead of the `otherIter` iterator, which could lead to incorrect results in the `diff()` function.

DONE.
