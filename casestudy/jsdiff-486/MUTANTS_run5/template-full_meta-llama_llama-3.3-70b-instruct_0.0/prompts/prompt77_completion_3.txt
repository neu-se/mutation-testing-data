Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called on the `obj` object instead of the `Object.prototype`, potentially leading to incorrect results if `obj` has overridden the `hasOwnProperty` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called with a string argument that is the concatenation of the `key` and an empty string, which could lead to incorrect results if the `key` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sortedKeys[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method would be called with the value of the `sortedKeys` array at index `i` instead of the `key` variable, potentially leading to incorrect results if the `sortedKeys` array contains values that are not property names of the `obj` object.

DONE.
