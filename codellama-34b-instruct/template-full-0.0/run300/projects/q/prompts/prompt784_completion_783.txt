  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not a function, so it would cause a runtime error when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called when the promise is rejected, which would not cause any errors but would also not provide any useful information.

DONE.
