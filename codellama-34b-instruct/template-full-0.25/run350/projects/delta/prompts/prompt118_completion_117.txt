  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length of the operation to be incremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length of the operation to be decremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length of the operation to be doubled, which could cause the program to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
