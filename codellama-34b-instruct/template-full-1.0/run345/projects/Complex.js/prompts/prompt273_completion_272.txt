  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the imaginary part instead of the real part, which would give a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add Ï€ to the real part before calculating the cosine, which would give a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of the real and imaginary parts before calculating the cosine, which would give a different result.

DONE.
