  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in an error when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method, as `null` does not have this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in an error when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method, as `undefined` does not have this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise + 1
```
This would result in an error when trying to access the `promiseDispatch` method, as the result of the addition operation is a `number` and not a `promise`.

DONE.
