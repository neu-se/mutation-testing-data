  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the +π would cause the longitude calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * π
```
This would result in different behavior because the *π would cause the longitude calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 - π
```
This would result in different behavior because the -π would cause the longitude calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
