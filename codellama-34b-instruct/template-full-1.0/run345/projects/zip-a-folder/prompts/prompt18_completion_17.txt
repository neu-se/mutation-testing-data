  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the ^ operator performs a bitwise XOR operation on the two constants, which would result in a different value than the bitwise OR operation performed by |.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator performs addition on the two constants, which would result in a different value than the bitwise OR operation performed by |.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the & operator performs a bitwise AND operation on the two constants, which would result in a different value than the bitwise OR operation performed by |.

DONE.
