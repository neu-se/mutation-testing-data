  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the `reason` variable, which might be important for handling the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the `rejection` variable, which might be important for handling the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a `null` value, which might cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
