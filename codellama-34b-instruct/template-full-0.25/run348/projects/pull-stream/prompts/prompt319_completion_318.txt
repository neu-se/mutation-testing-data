  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` when the test fails, but `undefined` would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` when the test fails, but `false` would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null` when the test fails, but `0` would return a different value.

DONE.
