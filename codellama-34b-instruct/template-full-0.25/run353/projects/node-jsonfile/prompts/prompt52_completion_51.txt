  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj + {}` would return a new object with the properties of `obj`, whereas `obj` would return the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj[0]` would return the first element of the array `obj`, whereas `obj` would return the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.length` would return the length of the array `obj`, whereas `obj` would return the entire array.

DONE.
