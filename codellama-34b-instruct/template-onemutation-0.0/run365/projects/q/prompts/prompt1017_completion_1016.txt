  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a method that handles rejection, while `done` is a method that handles resolution. Using `done` instead of `fail` would cause the promise to resolve even if the `dispatch` method fails, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
