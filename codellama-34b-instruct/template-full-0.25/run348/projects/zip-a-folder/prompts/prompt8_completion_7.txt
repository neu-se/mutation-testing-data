  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to continue executing even if the target base path is the same as the source path, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `targetBasePath`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to false, regardless of the value of `targetBasePath`, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
