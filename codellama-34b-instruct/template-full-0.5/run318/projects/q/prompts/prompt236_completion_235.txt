  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and `promise` does not have the same properties or methods as `resolvedPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array of arguments passed to the `promiseDispatch` method, and it does not have the same properties or methods as `resolvedPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods, and it is not the same as `resolvedPromise` which is an object.

DONE.
