  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the function to return the wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the result is incremented by 1, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the result is multiplied by 2, causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
