  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with the `progressed` callback, which could cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with the `progressed` callback, which could cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with the `progressed` callback, which could cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

DONE.
