  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `nodeify` method with `null` as the first argument, regardless of whether a nodeback was provided or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `nodeify` method with `undefined` as the first argument, regardless of whether a nodeback was provided or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the `nodeify` method with an empty function as the first argument, regardless of whether a nodeback was provided or not.

DONE.
