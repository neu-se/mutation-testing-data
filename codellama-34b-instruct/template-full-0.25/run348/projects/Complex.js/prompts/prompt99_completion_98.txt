  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point representation of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.toUpperCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.toUpperCase` returns the uppercase version of a string, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point representation of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.join` returns a string representing the array elements separated by a specified separator, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point representation of a string.

DONE.
