  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the newline character at the end of the string, rather than the start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the newline character at the length of the string, rather than the start.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the search for the newline character at the 0th index of the string, rather than the start.

DONE.
