Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to Infinity, which would incorrectly indicate that the complex number is finite if the imaginary part is finite, leading to false positives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is not equal to zero, which would incorrectly classify any complex number with a non-zero imaginary part as infinite, regardless of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is not finite, which would incorrectly classify a complex number as finite if the real part is finite but the imaginary part is infinite, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
