  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `test` function returns `false`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns `true`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && !test(data)
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns `true`. This will result in the `read` function being called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.
