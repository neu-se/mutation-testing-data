  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the `props` array, while the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would not modify the `props` array at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `props` except the first one, while the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would not modify the `props` array at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `props.pop()` would remove the last element from the `props` array, while the original code fragment `props.reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would not modify the `props` array at all.
