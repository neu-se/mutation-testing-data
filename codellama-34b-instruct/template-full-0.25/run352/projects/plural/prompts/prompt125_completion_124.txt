  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert all words to uppercase, while the original code fragment would leave the words unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr()` method would remove the first character of each word, while the original code fragment would leave the words unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
