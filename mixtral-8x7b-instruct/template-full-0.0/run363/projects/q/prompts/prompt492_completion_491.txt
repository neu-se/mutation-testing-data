By replacing `this` with a new object, the comparison will always be false, and the rejection will not be untracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a constructor function, and the `untrackRejection` function checks if the promise passed
