Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `normalizedUrl` to a string using the `+ ''` method, which could potentially lead to different results if `normalizedUrl` is not already a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unescape the original `url` instead of the `normalizedUrl`, which could lead to different results if the `url` has been modified during the normalization process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would encode the `normalizedUrl` using `encodeURI` instead of decoding it using `unescape`, which could lead to different results if the `normalizedUrl` contains special characters that need to be encoded.

DONE.
