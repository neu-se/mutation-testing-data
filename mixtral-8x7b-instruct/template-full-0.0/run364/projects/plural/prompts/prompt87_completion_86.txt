 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the hardcoded string is now the plural form, instead of the original singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'pear'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string is now unrelated to the original string, and would not match the rule added later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
word => word + 's'
