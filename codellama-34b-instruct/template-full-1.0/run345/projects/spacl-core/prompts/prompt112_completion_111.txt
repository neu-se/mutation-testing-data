  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let i = 0; i < verbs.length; i++) {
  const verb = verbs[i];
  // ...
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable `i` is not used within the loop, which could lead to bugs if the loop body is changed in the future.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
  // ...
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable `verb` is not used within the loop, which could lead to bugs if the loop body is changed in the future.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.keys()) {
  // ...
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop variable `verb` is not used within the loop, which could lead to bugs if the loop body is changed in the future.

DONE.
