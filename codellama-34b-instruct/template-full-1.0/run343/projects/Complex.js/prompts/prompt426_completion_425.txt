  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newPow = Math.sqrt;
Math.ypow;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ypow` is not a standard JavaScript function, and would cause the code to error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newPow = Math.square;
Math.ypow;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.square` is not a standard JavaScript function, and would cause the code to error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newPow = Math.yxxx;
Math.ypow;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.yxxx` is not a standard JavaScript function, and would cause the code to error.

DONE.
