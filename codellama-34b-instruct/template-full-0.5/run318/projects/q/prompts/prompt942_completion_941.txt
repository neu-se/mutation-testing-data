  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object in JavaScript that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any value. Replacing `arguments` with `undefined` would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, which would be passed as an argument to the function. This could cause the function to behave differently if it expects the `arguments` object to be an array of values.

DONE.
