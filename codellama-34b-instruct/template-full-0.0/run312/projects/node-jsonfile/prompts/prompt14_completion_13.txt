  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the negated value would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `shouldThrow` is `true`, which would result in the `err.message` being set to `${file}: ${err.message}` and the `err` being thrown, even if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `shouldThrow` is not `true`, the condition would evaluate to `false`, and the `if` statement would not be executed. This would cause the `err.message` to be set to `${file}: ${err.message}` and the `err` to be thrown, even if `shouldThrow` is `false`.
