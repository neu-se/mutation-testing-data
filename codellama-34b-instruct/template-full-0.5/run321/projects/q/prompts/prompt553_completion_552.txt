  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.error` is not a property of the `result` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not an object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not an array, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
