Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `linkurl` against itself instead of comparing the `linkurl` to the `pageurl`, leading to incorrect type determination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the function to attempt to access properties of `null`, resulting in a runtime error instead of a valid comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append "extra" to the `pageurl.host`, causing the comparison to always fail, thus misclassifying the link type.

DONE.
