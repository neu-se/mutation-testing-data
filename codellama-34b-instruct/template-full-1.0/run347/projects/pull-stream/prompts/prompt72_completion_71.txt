  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passed as an argument, while the new code fragment adds 1 to the data and then passes it as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passed as an argument, while the new code fragment concatenates the data with the string 'a' and then passes it as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is passed as an argument, while the new code fragment subtracts 1 from the data and then passes it as an argument.

DONE.
