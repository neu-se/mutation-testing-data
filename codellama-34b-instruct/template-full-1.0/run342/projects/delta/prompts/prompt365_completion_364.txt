  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && (otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert' || priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations and cause the `otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'` check to be performed before the `priority` check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert' || (priority && thisIter.peekType() === 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of operations and cause the `priority` check to be performed before the `otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'` check.
