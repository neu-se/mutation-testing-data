  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last segment of the pathname, rather than the entire pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pathname without the first character, rather than the entire pathname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pathname in lowercase, rather than the original case.

DONE.
