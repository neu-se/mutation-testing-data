  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/bison$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/i/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words ending in "bison" and replace the "i" with "e", resulting in "bise" instead of "bison".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/bison$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/i/, 'y') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words ending in "bison" and replace the "i" with "y", resulting in "bisy" instead of "bison".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/bison$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/i/, '') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would match words ending in "bison" and remove the "i", resulting in
