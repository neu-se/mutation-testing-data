  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is the opposite of `ses.ok`, so it would cause the code to behave in the opposite way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.maybeOk` is a new function that is not defined in the original code, so it would cause the code to behave in an unexpected way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok && ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if `ses.ok` is true and `ses.notOk` is true, which would always be false. This would cause the code to behave in a different way than the original code.

DONE.
