  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` argument is not passed to the `emit` method, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with the wrong key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `val` argument is not passed to the `emit` method, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this.get(key));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is not called with the correct key, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with the wrong value.

DONE.
