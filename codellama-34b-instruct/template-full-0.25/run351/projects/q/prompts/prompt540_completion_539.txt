  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is called with a different `this` value, which could affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` function is bound to a different context, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
