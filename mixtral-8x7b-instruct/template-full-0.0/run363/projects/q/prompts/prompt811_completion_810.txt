 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy callback'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `callback` is called without arguments, while the buggy version throws an error, which might not be handled properly in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `callback` is a function, while the buggy version is `null`, which might cause issues if the test suite assumes `callback` to be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `callback` is a function, while the buggy version is a function reference to `Q.resolve`, which might cause unexpected behavior if the test suite relies on the original callback behavior.

DONE.
