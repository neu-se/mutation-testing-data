  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `attributes` argument as `iter.next(1).attributes || {}`, which ensures that the `attributes` argument is always an object, even if the iterator returns `undefined`. In contrast, the modified code fragment would pass `{}` as the `attributes` argument if the iterator returns `undefined`, which could cause the `predicate` function to behave differently.
