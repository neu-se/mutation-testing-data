  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self,
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, this,
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode), rather than the current object, and would cause a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, null,
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and would cause a different error.

DONE.
