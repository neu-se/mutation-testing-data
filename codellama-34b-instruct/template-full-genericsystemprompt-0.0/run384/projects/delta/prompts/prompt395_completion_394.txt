  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is always `true` when `thisOp.delete` is `true`, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `thisOp.delete` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain && thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain && thisOp.delete` is always `false` when `thisOp.delete` is `false`, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete && thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete && thisOp.retain` is always `false` when `thisOp.delete` is `false`, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

DONE.
