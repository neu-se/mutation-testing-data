  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method will call the `warn` event instead of the `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'customError'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method will call the `customError` event instead of the `error` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is the same, but the `emit` method will call the `error` event with a different error message, which may or may not be handled differently by the event listener.

DONE.
