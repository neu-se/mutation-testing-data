  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in incorrect behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which slices the `arguments` object from the second argument onwards. Replacing it with `(arguments, 2))` would not slice the `arguments` object at all, and would instead use the entire `arguments` object as the array to slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which slices the `arguments` object from the second argument onwards. Replacing it with `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would slice the `arguments` object from the beginning, rather than from the second argument onwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which slices the `
