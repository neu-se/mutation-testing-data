  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different values, and using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to `φ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by a small amount, which could be significant in some use cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 360 to `φ2` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by a large amount, which could be significant in some use cases.

DONE.
