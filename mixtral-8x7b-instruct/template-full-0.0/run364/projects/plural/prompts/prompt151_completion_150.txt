 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` is a global object in a browser environment, while `this` in the original code refers to the current string object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value representing the absence of any object value, while `this` in the original code refers to the current string object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math` is a built-in object that contains math-related functions, while `this` in the original code refers to the current string object.

DONE.
