 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would receive an empty string, which would result in an array with a single element, the original string. In the original code, the `split` method is used to split the `src` string into an array of strings based on the `,` delimiter, so replacing it with an empty string would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'or'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would receive the string `'or'` as the delimiter, which would result in an array with more elements than the original array. In the original code, the `split` method is used to split the `src` string into an array of strings based on the `,` delimiter, so replacing it with the string `'or'` would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
