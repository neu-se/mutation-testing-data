  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate indefinitely.

DONE.
