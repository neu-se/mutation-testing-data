  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error if the path contains empty segments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error if the path contains empty segments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) => null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error if the path contains empty segments, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
