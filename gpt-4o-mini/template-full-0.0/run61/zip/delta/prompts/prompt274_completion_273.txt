Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return early if the next operation is a delete, potentially skipping over important insert operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'equal'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return early if the next operation is an equal operation, which may lead to missing out on processing insert operations that follow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return early if the next operation is a retain, which could prevent the processing of insert operations that should be handled in the context of retaining operations.

DONE.
