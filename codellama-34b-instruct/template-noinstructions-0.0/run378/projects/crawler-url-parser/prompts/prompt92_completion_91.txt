  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment removes the query string from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the "http://" protocol to the URL if it is missing, while the new code fragment adds the "http://" protocol to the URL if it is missing and the URL does not start with "//".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment removes the fragment identifier and any characters after it from the URL.

DONE.
