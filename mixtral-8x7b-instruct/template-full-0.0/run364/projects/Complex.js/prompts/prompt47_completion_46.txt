 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'abs' of a && 'arg' of a
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `of` operator instead of `in`, which would throw a `TypeError` if `a` is not an object with the `abs` and `arg` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'abs' in Object(a) && 'arg' in Object(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `a` with `Object()` before checking for the properties. This could lead to different behavior if `a` is a primitive value, as it would be boxed into an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'im' in a && 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the `im` and `re` properties instead of the `abs` and `arg` properties. This would cause the function to behave differently when
