  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `Complex` object instead of the `isInfinite` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `Complex` object instead of the `isInfinite` property.
