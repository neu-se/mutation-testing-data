  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a null value as argument, but the replaced code fragment returns a false value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a value as argument, but the replaced code fragment returns an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-zero value as argument, but the replaced code fragment returns a zero value.

DONE.
