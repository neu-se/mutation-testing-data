  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` is a function that returns the next element in the iteration, while `iter.next()` is a function call that returns the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(1)` is a function call that returns the next element in the iteration, but only if the element is not the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` is a function call that returns the next element in the iteration, but only if the element is not the first or second one.

DONE.
