 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, which may cause incorrect slicing or composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 1000, which may cause incorrect slicing or composition of operations, especially when the actual length is smaller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peek('invalidProperty')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access an invalid property, causing a runtime error and preventing the code from executing further.

DONE.
