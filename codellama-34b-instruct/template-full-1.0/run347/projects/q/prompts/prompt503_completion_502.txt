  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `this` context to the `apply()` method, which could result in errors or unexpected behavior if the called function relies on the `this` context being undefined or some object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `args` array would be passed as the `this` context to the `apply()` method, which could result in errors or unexpected behavior if the called function relies on the `this` context being undefined or some object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}, args
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as the `this` context to the `apply()` method, which could result in errors or unexpected behavior if the called function relies on the `this` context being undefined or some object.

DONE.
