  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the value of `_value` to the `cb` function, while this modified code fragment passes the value of `_value` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the value of `_value` to the `cb` function, while this modified code fragment passes the value of `_value` multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the value of `_value` to the `cb` function, while this modified code fragment passes the string representation of `_value`.

DONE.
