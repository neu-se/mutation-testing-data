Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of propagating the caught exception, it would return a rejected promise with a fixed error message, potentially masking the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a constant value (42) instead of rejecting it with the caught exception, leading to a successful resolution regardless of the error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve("Handled error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a specific message indicating that the error was handled, rather than rejecting it, which could lead to the calling code not being aware that an error occurred.

DONE.
