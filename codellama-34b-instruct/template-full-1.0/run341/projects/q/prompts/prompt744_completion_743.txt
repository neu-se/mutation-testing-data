  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `when` promise waits for the promise to be resolved before calling `onFulfilled`. However, with `onRejected`, the promise waits for the promise to be rejected before calling the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `when` waits for the promise to be resolved or rejected, but `promise.then` only waits for the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `when` waits for all promises to be resolved, but `promise.all` waits for all promises to be resolved and then returns an array of resolved values.

DONE.
