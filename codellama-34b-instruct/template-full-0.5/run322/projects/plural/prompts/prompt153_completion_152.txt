  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", num
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` as the first argument, which refers to the string object that the method is being called on. By replacing it with a blank string, the method will not be able to access the string object and will likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, num
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` as the first argument, which refers to the string object that the method is being called on. By replacing it with `null`, the method will not be able to access the string object and will likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello", num
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this` as the first argument, which refers to the string object that the method is being called on. By replacing it with a different string, the method will not be able to access the original string
