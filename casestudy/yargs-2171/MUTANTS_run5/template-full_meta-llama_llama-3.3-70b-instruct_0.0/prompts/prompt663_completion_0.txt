Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(descriptions, key) && typeof desc === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditional logic to only execute when the key exists in descriptions and the description is a string, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof desc === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the description is an object, rather than checking if the key exists in descriptions or if the description is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.prototype.includes(Object.keys(descriptions), key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the includes method to check if the key is in the array of keys from descriptions, which could lead to incorrect results if the key is not a string or if the descriptions object has a complex structure.

DONE.
