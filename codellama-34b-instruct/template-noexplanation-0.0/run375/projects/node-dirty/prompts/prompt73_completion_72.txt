  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'ENOFILE'
```
This change will cause the code to treat "ENOFILE" errors the same way as "ENOENT" errors, which may be desirable if the code is intended to handle both types of errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' && err.code === 'ENOFILE'
```
This change will cause the code to only treat "ENOENT" errors as "ENOFILE" errors if the error code is both "ENOENT" and "ENOFILE", which is unlikely to be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'ENOFILE' || err.code === 'ENODIR'
```
This change will cause the code to treat "ENOENT" errors, "ENOFILE" errors
