 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array from the iterator returned by `urlMap.values()`, which could cause issues if the order of elements is important or if the application relies on the live collection returned by the original method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of keys instead of an array of values, which could cause issues if the application relies on the actual values stored in the Map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(urlMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array of values, but the order of elements is not guaranteed, which could cause issues if the order is important. Additionally, this method does not work in older browsers without polyfills.

DONE.
