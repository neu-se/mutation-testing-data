  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearer` function is not defined in the code, so it would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearer.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is not defined on the `nearer` function, so it would throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearer.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not defined on the `nearer` function, so it would throw a TypeError.

DONE.
