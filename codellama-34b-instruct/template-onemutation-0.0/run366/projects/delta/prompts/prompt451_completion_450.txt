  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of `hasNext()`, which means that the `rest()` method will return an empty array if there are no more ops to iterate over, instead of returning the remaining ops.

DONE.
