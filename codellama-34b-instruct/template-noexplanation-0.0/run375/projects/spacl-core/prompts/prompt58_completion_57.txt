  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$2'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to capture the wrong group, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$0'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to capture the entire match, rather than just the first group, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$3'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to capture the third group, rather than the first group, leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
