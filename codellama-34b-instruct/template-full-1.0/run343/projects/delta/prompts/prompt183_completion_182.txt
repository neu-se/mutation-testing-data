  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` method to consider `delete` operations, which would not be taken into account in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? otherOp.retain : NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new conditional check, which would affect the outcome of the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === thisOp.retain ? otherOp.retain : NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a new conditional check, which would affect the outcome of the `compose` method.

DONE.
