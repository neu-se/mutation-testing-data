  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, but `data.length` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, but `data.key` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is an object, but `data.value` is a string.

DONE.
