  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes) && lastOp.attributes === newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `lastOp.attributes === newOp.attributes` would cause the code to always return `false`, even if the attributes are equal, because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the values being compared.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes) && lastOp.attributes.length === newOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check `lastOp.attributes.length === newOp.attributes.length` would cause the code to always return `false`, even if the attributes are equal, because the `length` property of an object is always an integer, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the values being compared.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
