  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would not be called with the `true` argument, which would prevent the `unhandledRejections` array from being reset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with the `null` argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with the `undefined` argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
