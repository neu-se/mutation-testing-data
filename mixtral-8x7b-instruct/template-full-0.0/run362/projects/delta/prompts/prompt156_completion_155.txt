 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.hasNext(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a single next item in the iterator, instead of checking if there is any next item without specifying the number of items to look ahead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.hasNext(0)
