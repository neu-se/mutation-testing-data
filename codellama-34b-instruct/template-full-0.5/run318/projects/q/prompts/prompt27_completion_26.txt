  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `domain` variable, which is an object, and `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `domain` variable, which is an object, and `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"domain"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `domain` variable, which is an object, and a string literal is a primitive value.

DONE.
