  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cat', 'cats')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` is called with different arguments, which would create a new set of rules for the word "cats".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` is called with an additional argument, which would create a new set of rules for the word "bacteria".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacilli')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `addRule` is called with a different callback function argument, which would create a new set of rules for the word "bacilli".

DONE.
