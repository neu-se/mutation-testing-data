  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && true) || true`, which would always be true, even if `abort` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is true, the expression would be false, and if `abort` is false, the expression would be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `abort` is not strictly equal to true, the expression would be true, and if `abort` is strictly equal to true, the expression would be false.

DONE.
