  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve(reject(exception))` would cause the promise to be resolved with a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be resolved with a resolved promise.

DONE.
