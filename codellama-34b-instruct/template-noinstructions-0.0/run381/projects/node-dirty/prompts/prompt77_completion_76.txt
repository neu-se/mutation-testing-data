  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the number of items in the database, while the new code would emit an `'error'` event with the value `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the number of items in the database, while the new code would emit a `'load'` event with the value `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the number of items in the database, while the new code would emit a `'load'` event with the value `null`.

DONE.
