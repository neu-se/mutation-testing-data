  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foobar");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error with the message "foobar", instead of the original error with the message "Quux error".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "foobar";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string "foobar", instead of the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 / 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a divide by zero error, instead of the original error.

DONE.
