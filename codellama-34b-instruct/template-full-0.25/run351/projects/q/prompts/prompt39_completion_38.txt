  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw e;` to re-throw the error synchronously, which would interrupt the flushing process and cause the error to be handled immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw e;` to re-throw the error synchronously, which would interrupt the flushing process and cause the error to be handled immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(e.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `throw e;` to re-throw the error synchronously, which would interrupt the flushing process and cause the error to be handled immediately.

DONE.
