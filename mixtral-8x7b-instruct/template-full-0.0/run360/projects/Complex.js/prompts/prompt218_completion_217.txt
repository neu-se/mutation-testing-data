 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.acos (arc cosine) returns the angle in radians for which the cosine is the given value, while Math.cos (cosine) returns the cosine of a given angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because Math.sin (sine) returns the sine of a given angle, while Math.cos (cosine) returns the cosine of a given angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the cosine value, which is not equivalent to the original Math.cos. This change would lead to incorrect results or even division by zero errors.

DONE.
