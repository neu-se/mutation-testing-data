  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, whereas `Q.resolve` returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first argument, whereas `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first argument.

DONE.
