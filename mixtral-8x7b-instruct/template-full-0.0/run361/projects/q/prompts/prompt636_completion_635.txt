 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolveThrown
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolveThrown` would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which is different from the original behavior of `this.dispatch`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` would immediately return the promise object, instead of waiting for the `promiseDispatch` method to resolve or reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver().resolve` would bypass the `promiseDispatch` method and directly resolve the promise, which is different from the original behavior of `this.dispatch`.

DONE.
