  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an additional argument to the `delete` method, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string value instead of the actual value of the `value` variable, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the value to be deleted, which would cause the `delete` method to fail.

DONE.
