  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').length
```
This would result in different behavior because `src.split(',')` returns an array, and taking the length of the array would not work as intended, especially since `src` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `src` is a string, and converting it to uppercase would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.repeat(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `src` is a string, and repeating it would not work as intended.

DONE.
