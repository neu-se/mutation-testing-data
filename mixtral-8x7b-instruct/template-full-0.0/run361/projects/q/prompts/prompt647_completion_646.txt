 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `Promise.prototype.post` method is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `name` property of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
