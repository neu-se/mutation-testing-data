  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if(ended = ended || end) {
    last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is only called if `ended` is true, but the original code calls the callback function for any `end` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if(ended = ended || end) {
    last ? cb(null, data) : terminate(cb)
  }
