Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `cb` is explicitly `null`, which would not account for other falsy values like `undefined`, leading to potential incorrect handling of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `cb` is defined, which would allow the function to proceed even if `cb` is a falsy value (like `null` or `0`), potentially causing unexpected behavior in the callback logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `acc` is falsy instead of checking `cb`, which would change the logic of how the function initializes `cb` and `acc`, potentially leading to incorrect accumulation of values.

DONE.
