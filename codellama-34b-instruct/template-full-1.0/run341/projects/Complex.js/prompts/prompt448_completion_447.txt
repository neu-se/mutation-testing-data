  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Math.round(this['re']*places)/places*Math.round(this['im']*places)/places);
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is missing between `Math.round(this['re']*places)/places` and `Math.round(this['im']*places)/places`, causing the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Math.round(this['re']*places)/places+Math.round(this['im']*places)/places);
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator is replaced with an addition operator, causing the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(Math.round(this['re']*places/places)+Math.round(this['im']*places/places));
```
