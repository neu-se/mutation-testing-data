  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `1` instead of `0`, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `-1` instead of `0`, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `null` instead of `0`, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

DONE.
