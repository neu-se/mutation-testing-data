  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^\ufeff/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of the data, which is not what the original code fragment does. The original code fragment uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM, which is a more robust way of doing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^(\ufeff)?/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the beginning of the data, but it would also remove any other characters that match the regular expression `/^(\ufeff)?/`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = data.replace(/^(\ufeff)?/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the UTF-8 BOM (Byte
