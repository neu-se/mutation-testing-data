  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the letter to replace, but this new code fragment would always replace the first letter of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the letter to replace, but this new code fragment would always replace the last letter of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * word.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word to determine the index of the letter to replace, but this new code fragment would randomly replace a letter in the word.

DONE.
