 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to convert the value to a string, which may not be possible or desirable for all data types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key) || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object if the key is not found, rather than `undefined`. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the calling code assumes that a missing key will always result in `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key + 'x')
```
This would result in different behavior because it looks up a different key than the one provided, potentially returning the wrong value or causing an error if the key does not exist.

DONE.
