  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(Promise.reject("error"), callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would reject the promise instead of resolving it with the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(undefined, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(null, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would resolve the promise with `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
