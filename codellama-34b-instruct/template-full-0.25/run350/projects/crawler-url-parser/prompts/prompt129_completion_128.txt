  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` argument to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrl` object to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl, baseUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
