  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `a` is equal to zero, rather than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether `b` is not equal to zero, rather than equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to zero, rather than checking if `b` is equal to zero.

DONE.
