  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, as `call` is a method that always returns the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.bind(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a bound function that would always return `true`, as `bind` is a method that always returns a new function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.apply(this, [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, as `apply` is a method that always returns the `this` value.

DONE.
