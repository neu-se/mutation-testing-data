  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is infinite, rather than the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is finite, rather than infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, rather than infinite.

DONE.
