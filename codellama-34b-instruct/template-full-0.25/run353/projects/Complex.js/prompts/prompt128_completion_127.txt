  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is `Infinity`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isInfinite`, so if `z` is `Infinity`, the result would be `false`, while if `z` is not `Infinity`, the result would be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is `Infinity`.

DONE.
