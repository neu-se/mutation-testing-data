 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it simplifies the expression for cos(z) and eliminates the hyperbolic functions, which are important for the correct result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of the imaginary part instead of the hyperbolic sine, which is required for the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the sine of the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of using the correct formula for the sine of a complex number.

DONE.
