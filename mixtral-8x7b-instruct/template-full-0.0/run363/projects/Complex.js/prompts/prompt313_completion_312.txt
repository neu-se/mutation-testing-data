 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b) - Math.exp(-b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the hyperbolic cosine using the definition with the exponential function, but without the factor of 0.5, which would lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(2 * b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the hyperbolic cosine using the definition with the exponential function, but with a different base, which would lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the hyperbolic cosine using the sine function, which is incorrect, as the hyperbolic cosine and sine are not directly related in this way.

DONE.
