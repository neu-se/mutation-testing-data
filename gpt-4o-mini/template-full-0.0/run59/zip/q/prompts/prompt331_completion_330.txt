Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the result, it would reject the promise, causing any subsequent `.then` handlers for success to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined` regardless of the actual result, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the promise chain where the resolved value is expected to be meaningful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null`, which is different from resolving it with the actual result, potentially causing confusion or errors in the handling of the resolved value in subsequent promise operations.

DONE.
