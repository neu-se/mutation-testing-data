  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(cb));`
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass a callback function to `this._writeStream.destroy()`, while the mutated code does pass a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(err));`
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass an error object to `this._writeStream.destroy()`, while the mutated code does pass an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));`
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a callback function to `this._writeStream.destroy()`, while the mutated code passes `null`.

DONE.
