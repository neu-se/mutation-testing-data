  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the next operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` returns the next operation itself, while `iter.peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` returns the next operation and advances the iterator, while `iter.peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
