  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire baseOp, rather than just the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp) - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire baseOp, rather than just the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp) - 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire baseOp, rather than just the newline character.

DONE.
