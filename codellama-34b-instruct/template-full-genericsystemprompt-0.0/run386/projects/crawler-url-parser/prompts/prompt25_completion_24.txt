  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a '#' character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would replace it with a '?' character.

DONE.
