  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be called on the `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code where `delete` is called on the `object` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation would be called on the `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code where `set` is called on the `object` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be called on the `Q` object, which is not the same as the original code where `get` is called on the `object` argument.

DONE.
