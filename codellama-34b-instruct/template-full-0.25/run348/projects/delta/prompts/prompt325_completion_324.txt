  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last character of the slice, which could cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra character in the slice, which could cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the slice, which could cause the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
