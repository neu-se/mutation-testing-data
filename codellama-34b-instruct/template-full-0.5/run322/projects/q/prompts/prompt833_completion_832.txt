  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `progress` function would not be called if it is passed as the third argument to `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `progress` function would not be called if it is passed as the third argument to `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, so the `progress` function would not be called if it is passed as the third argument to `then`.

DONE.
