  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `process.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `flush` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `process.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds, rather than passing it as an argument to `process.nextTick`.

DONE.
