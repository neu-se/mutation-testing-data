  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function is not called, which is necessary for the code to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function is called with `0` as an argument, which is not the intended usage of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function is called with `false` as an argument, which is not the intended usage of the function.

DONE.
