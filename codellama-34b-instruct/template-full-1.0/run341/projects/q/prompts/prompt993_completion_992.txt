  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved with a value, and any code that depends on the resolved value will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved with a value, and any code that depends on the resolved value will not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved with a value, and any code that depends on the resolved value will not be executed.

DONE.
