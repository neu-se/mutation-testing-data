Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` and `unescape` have opposite effects on the input string, with `encodeURI` escaping special characters and `unescape` unescaping them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl => normalizedUrl.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire URL to uppercase, which could lead to incorrect URL resolution or other issues, whereas the original `unescape` function only unescapes special characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
normalizedUrl => normalizedUrl.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first character of the URL, which could result in an invalid or incorrect URL, whereas the original `unescape` function leaves the URL intact except for unescaping special characters.

DONE.
