  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `diff` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `diff` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to return a different value, which could affect the behavior of the `diff` method.

DONE.
