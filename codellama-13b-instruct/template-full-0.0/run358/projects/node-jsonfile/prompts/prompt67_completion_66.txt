  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would not replace any occurrences of the newline character (`\n`) with the specified EOL character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of the newline character (`\n`) with the specified EOL character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of the newline character (`\n`) with the specified EOL character, and also replace all occurrences of the carriage return character (`\r`) with the specified EOL character.

DONE.
