  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the operands are swapped, and the result would be a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the operand is multiplied by 2, and the result would be a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the operands are added, and the result would be a different complex number.

DONE.
