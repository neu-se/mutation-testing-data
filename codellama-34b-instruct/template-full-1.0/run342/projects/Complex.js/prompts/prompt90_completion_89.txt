  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (tokens[i + 1] !== ' ') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only add the complex number if the next token is not a space, instead of always adding it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only add the complex number if the next token is 'i' or 'I', instead of always adding it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof tokens[i + 1] === 'number') {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only add the complex number if the next token is a number, instead of always adding it.

DONE.
