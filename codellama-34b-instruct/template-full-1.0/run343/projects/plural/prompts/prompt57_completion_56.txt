  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]ves$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match words that end with a vowel followed by "ves", whereas the original code fragment would match any word that ends with "y" or "ves".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]ves$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match words that end with a consonant followed by "ves", whereas the original code fragment would match any word that ends with "y" or "ves".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(ies|ves)$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match words that end with "ies" or "ves", whereas the original code fragment would match any word that ends with "y" or "ves".

DONE.
