  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was looking for the sum of `plus` and `minus` to be 0, but this replacement code would look for the sum to be 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus === minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was looking for the sum of `plus` and `minus` to be 0, but this replacement code would look for the two variables to be equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!plus === !minus
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was looking for the sum of `plus` and `minus` to be 0, but this replacement code would look for the two variables to be non-equal.

DONE.
