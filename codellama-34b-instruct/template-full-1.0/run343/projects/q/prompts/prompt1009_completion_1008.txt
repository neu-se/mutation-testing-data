  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be created with an extra element, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be created with an undefined element, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be created with an extra element that is not a function, which may cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error.

DONE.
