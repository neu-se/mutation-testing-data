 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would always be true, and the `deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value))` line would not be executed, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would always be true, and the `deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value))` line would not be executed, even if the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` condition would always be true, and the `deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value))` line would not be executed, even if the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
