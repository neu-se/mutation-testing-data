  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because `!unique` is the negation of `unique`, so it would pass an item through when you see it for the first time, rather than the second time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `unique && false` is always false, so it would never pass an item through, regardless of whether it has been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `unique || true` is always true, so it would always pass an item through, regardless of whether it has been seen before.

DONE.
