  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new string, starting at the specified index (1 in this case), which would cause the `directory()` method to operate on a different directory than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method returns a new string, with all characters in uppercase, which would cause the `directory()` method to operate on a different directory than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods are used to reverse the order of the characters in the `src` string, which would cause the `directory()` method to operate on a different directory than the original code.

DONE.
