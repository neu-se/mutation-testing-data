  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable would be concatenated with the string "foo", which would change the method name being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable would be converted to uppercase, which would change the method name being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` variable would be replaced with its length, which would change the method name being called.

DONE.
