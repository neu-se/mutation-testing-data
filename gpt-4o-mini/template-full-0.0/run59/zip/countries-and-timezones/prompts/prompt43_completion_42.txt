Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assign `null` for the country with the given `id`, effectively omitting the actual country data from the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `getCountry` without the `options` parameter, potentially leading to different country data being returned, especially if `options` are necessary for the correct retrieval of country information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `options` parameter to always include `deprecated: true`, which may alter the returned country data by including deprecated timezones that would otherwise be excluded.

DONE.
