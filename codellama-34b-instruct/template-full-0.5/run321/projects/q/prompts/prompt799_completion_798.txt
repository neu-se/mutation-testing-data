  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects a function as its second argument, and passing `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects a function as its second argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` method expects a function as its second argument, and passing an empty function would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
