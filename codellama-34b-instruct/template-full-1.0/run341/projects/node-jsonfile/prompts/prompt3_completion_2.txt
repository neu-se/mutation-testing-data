  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${file}.length + 1`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `${file}` template literal is replaced with a new string that is one character longer than the original file name. This would cause the `readFile` function to read a file with a different name, potentially leading to unintended behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${file}.toLowerCase()`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `${file}` template literal is replaced with a new string that has all letters in lowercase. This would cause the `readFile` function to read a file with a different name, potentially leading to unintended behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`file + '_temp'`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `${file}` template literal is replaced with a new string that is the original file name with the `_temp` suffix appended. This would cause the `readFile` function
