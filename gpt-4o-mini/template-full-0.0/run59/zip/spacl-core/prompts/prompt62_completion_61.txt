Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, leaving the original `props` array unchanged, whereas `reverse()` modifies the original array in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing `length` returns the number of elements in the `props` array, which does not provide the actual elements themselves, unlike `reverse()` which returns the elements in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.map(p => p.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, transforming the elements to uppercase, rather than reversing their order.

DONE.
