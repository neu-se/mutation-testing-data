  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array, and `self` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` is the first element of the `args` array, and `self` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` is the number of elements in the `args` array, and `self` is an object.

DONE.
