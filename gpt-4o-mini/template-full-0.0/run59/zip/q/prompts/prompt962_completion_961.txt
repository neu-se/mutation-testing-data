Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index from which the arguments are sliced, potentially omitting the first argument and altering the expected input for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the slicing method to only include the first argument, instead of all arguments, which would lead to incorrect behavior when multiple arguments are expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses only the first argument directly instead of creating an array of all arguments, which would break the expected behavior of passing multiple arguments to the function.

DONE.
