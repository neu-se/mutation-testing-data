  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which can be used to iterate over the rules in the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This code fragment creates a new array containing only the rules that match the given path and query context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reduce((acc, rule) => acc || rule.matches(path, ctx), false)
```
This code fragment uses the `reduce` method to iterate over the rules in the policy and return `true` if any of the rules match the given path and query context.

DONE.
