  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any instances of "http://" with "https://" in the base URL string, potentially changing the URL scheme and causing issues with the rest of the code logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://www.example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the base URL string with a hardcoded value of "https://www.example.com", potentially causing issues with the rest of the code logic that relies on the original base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol = "https:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the protocol property of the parsed base URL to "https:", potentially changing the URL scheme and causing issues with the rest of the code logic.

DONE.
