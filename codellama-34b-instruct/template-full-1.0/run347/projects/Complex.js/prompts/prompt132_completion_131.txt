  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with the argument `1`, which would always return `false`, even if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with the argument `NaN`, which would always return `true`, even if the complex number is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method would be called with the argument `this`, which would always return `true`, even if the complex number is not infinite.

DONE.
