  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method would be called on the `this._writeStream` object, which would stop the stream from emitting events until the `uncork()` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method would be called on the `this._writeStream` object, which would end the writing stream and make it impossible to write any more data to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method would be called on the `this._writeStream` object, which would close the writing stream and make it impossible to write any more data to it.

DONE.
