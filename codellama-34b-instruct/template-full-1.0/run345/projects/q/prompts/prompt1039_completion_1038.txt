  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
  if (error) {
    closed.resolve(error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the existence of the `error` argument before throwing the error, while this new code fragment would throw the error regardless of whether the `error` argument is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
  closed.resolve(new Error("Queue closed"));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is resolving the `closed` promise with the value passed to the `close` method, while this new code fragment would always resolve the `closed` promise with the hard-coded error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
  closed.reject(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is resolving the `closed` promise with the
