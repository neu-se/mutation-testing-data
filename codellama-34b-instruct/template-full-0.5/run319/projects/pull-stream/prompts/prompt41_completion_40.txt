  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the first argument, and the arguments provided to the new function are appended to the arguments provided to the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.curry
```
This would result in different behavior because `curry` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the first argument, and the arguments provided to the new function are used to partially apply the original function.

DONE.
