  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return the first truthy value, which in this case would be `currentUrl` instead of `currentUrl.url`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `true` only if `currentUrl.url` has a length greater than 0, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url.indexOf('http') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return the index of the first occurrence of the substring 'http' in `currentUrl.url`, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
