  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseUrl` variable to be used as the base URL for the URL parsing, rather than the `sourceUrl` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sourceUrl` variable to be treated as a directory path, rather than a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sourceUrl` variable to be treated as an HTTPS URL, rather than an HTTP URL.

DONE.
