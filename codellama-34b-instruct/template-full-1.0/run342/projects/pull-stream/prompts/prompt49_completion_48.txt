  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 1
```
This would cause the loop to run indefinitely, as the counter variable `i` will never reach the value of `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length + 1
```
This would cause the loop to run only once, as the counter variable `i` will be greater than the value of `length` in the first iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 2 * length
```
This would cause the loop to run twice the number of times it should, as the counter variable `i` will be double the value of `length` in the first iteration.

DONE.
