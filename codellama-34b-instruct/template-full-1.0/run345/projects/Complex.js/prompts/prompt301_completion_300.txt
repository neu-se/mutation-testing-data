  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cmath.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `cmath.cosh` is a different function than `cosh`, and may produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `math.cosh` is a different function than `cosh`, and may produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
custom_cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `custom_cosh` is a user-defined function that may have a different implementation than `cosh` and may produce different results.

DONE.
