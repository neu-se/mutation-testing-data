  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `value + 1`. This means that the new promise will resolve with a different value than the original promise, which would cause the `all` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that resolves with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `value * 2`. This means that the new promise will resolve with a different value than the original promise, which would cause the `all` method to return a different value.
