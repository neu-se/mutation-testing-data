  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` is a different value than `options`, which is the original argument passed to the `readFileSync` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.throws` is a different value than `options`, which is the original argument passed to the `readFileSync` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is a different value than `options`, which is the original argument passed to the `readFileSync` function.

DONE.
