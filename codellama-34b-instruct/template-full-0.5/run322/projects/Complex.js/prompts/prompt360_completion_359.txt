  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b + 1` expression would always be non-zero, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `b` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b * 2` expression would always be non-zero, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `b` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b / 2` expression would always be non-zero, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `b` is zero.

DONE.
