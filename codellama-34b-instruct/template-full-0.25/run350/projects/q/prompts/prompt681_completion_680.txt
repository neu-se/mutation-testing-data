  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used instead of `apply`, which changes the way the function is called and may result in different arguments being passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used, but the arguments passed to the function are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used, which changes the way the function is called and may result in different arguments being passed to the function.

DONE.
