  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain =
    typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to `length` instead of `otherOp.retain`, which could cause the code to behave differently when `otherOp.retain` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain =
    typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' ? length : otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to `length` instead of `otherOp.retain`, which could cause the code to behave differently when `otherOp.retain` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
