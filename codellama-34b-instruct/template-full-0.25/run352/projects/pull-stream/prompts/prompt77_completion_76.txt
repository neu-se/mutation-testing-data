  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
loop
```
This would result in different behavior because `loop` is always truthy, so the `while` loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is set to `true` when the `read` callback is called, so the `while` loop would never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!read
```
This would result in different behavior because `read` is set to a function, so the `while` loop would never terminate.

DONE.
