  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, rather than inserting it at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than inserting it at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index - 1, 0, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the specified index, rather than inserting it at the current index.

DONE.
