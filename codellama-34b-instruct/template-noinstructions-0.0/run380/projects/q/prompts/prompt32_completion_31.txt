  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so it would not execute the `task` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw an error when trying to execute it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error when trying to execute it.

DONE.
