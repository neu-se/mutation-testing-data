  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used instead of `add`, which would cause the map to overwrite existing entries with the same key instead of adding new ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.add(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `add` method is used instead of `set`, which would cause the map to add new entries with the same key instead of overwriting existing ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used instead of `add` or `set`, which would cause the map to remove existing entries with the same key instead of adding or overwriting them.

DONE.
