 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would cause a division by zero error when `a` is 0, while the original code fragment would return `Infinity` for the `im` property of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always return a positive value for the `im` property of the result, while the original code fragment could return a negative value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would negate the value of `a`, while the original code fragment would not change the sign of `a`.

DONE.
