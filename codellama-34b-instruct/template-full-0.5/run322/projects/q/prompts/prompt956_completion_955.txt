  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be added to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line to throw a `TypeError` when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be added to the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());` line to throw a `TypeError` when the code is executed.

DONE.
