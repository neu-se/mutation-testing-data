  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the original function's context. In this case, the original function is `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, which is a method that checks if a property is present in an object. By using `uncurryThis` on this method, we are effectively creating a new function that is bound to the context of `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, which means that it will always return `true` when called with a property that is present in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that is bound to the original function's context. In this case, the original function is `Array.
