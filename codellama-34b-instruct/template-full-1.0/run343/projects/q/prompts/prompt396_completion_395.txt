  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reverseValue; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reversed value, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value.reverse(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reversed value of the original value, rather than the original value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original value plus one, rather than the original value itself.

DONE.
