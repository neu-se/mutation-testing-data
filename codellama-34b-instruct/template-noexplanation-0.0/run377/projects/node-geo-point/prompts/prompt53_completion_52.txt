  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This code fragment adds 180 degrees to the longitude difference, which would result in an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This code fragment multiplies the longitude difference by 2, which would result in an incorrect bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This code fragment subtracts 180 degrees from the longitude difference, which would result in an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
