  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick` is defined as a function that posts a message to the message channel's port, whereas `flush` is defined as a function that calls the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` would call the `flush` function with `1` as the argument, whereas `flush, 0` would call the `flush` function with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush)` would call the `flush` function after a timeout of 0 milliseconds, whereas `flush, 0` would call the `flush` function immediately.

DONE.
