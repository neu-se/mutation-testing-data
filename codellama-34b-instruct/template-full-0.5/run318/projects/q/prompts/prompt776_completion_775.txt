  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) {
    return result + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the resolved value of the promise by 1, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) {
    return result * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the resolved value of the promise, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (result) {
    return result.toUpperCase();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the resolved value of the promise to uppercase, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the resolved value.

DONE.
