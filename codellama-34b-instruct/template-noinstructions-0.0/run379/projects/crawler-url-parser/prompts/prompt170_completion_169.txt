  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal. This would cause the function to return "external" for links that have the same domain as the page, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.includes(pageurl.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if the page domain is a substring of the link domain. This would cause the function to return "external" for links that have a domain that includes the page domain, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.startsWith(pageurl.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if the page domain is a prefix
