  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'drain'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `close()` method to be called immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'close'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `close()` method to be called immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'error'` is not emitted in the original code, and it would cause the `close()` method to be called immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
