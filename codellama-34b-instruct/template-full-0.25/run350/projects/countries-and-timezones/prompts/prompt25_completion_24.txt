  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the `dstOffset` variable, which is not the same as calling it with the `utcOffset` variable as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the sum of `utcOffset` and `dstOffset`, which is not the same as calling it with `utcOffset` or `dstOffset` separately as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset - dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getOffsetStr` function with the difference between `utcOffset` and `dstOffset`, which is not the same as calling it with `utcOffset` or `dstOffset
