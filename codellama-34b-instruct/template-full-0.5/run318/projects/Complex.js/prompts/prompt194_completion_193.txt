  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `b` instead of `a`, which is a different variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `z['re']` instead of `z['im']`, which is a different variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `b` instead of `a`, and `z['re']` instead of `z['im']`, which are different variables.

DONE.
