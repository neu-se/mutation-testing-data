  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearer` function to return the rejection reason instead of the fulfillment value, which could break code that relies on the function returning a fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value instead of the rejection reason, which could break code that relies on the function returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nearer` function to return the pending promise instead of the fulfillment value or rejection reason, which could break code that relies on the function returning a fulfilled or rejected promise.

DONE.
