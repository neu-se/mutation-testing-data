  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` values would be passed as arguments to the `then` method, which would cause the callbacks to be called with `null` instead of the expected values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` values would be passed as arguments to the `then` method, which would cause the callbacks to be called with `undefined` instead of the expected values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` values would be passed as arguments to the `then` method, which would cause the callbacks to be called with `void 0` instead of the expected values.

DONE.
