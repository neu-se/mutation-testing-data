  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with an index that is one less than the original index, which would result in the new op being inserted at a different position in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with an index that is one greater than the original index, which would result in the new op being inserted at a different position in the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would be called with an index that is twice the original index, which would result in the new op being inserted at a different position in the `ops` array.

DONE.
