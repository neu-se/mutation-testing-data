  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, causing the `done` callback to be called with the rejection reason as its argument. In the original code, the promise was rejected after a timeout, so the `done` callback would be called with a different reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Q.notify()` will send a notification to the progress handlers registered on the promise, but it will not affect the resolution of the promise. In the original code, the promise was resolved with a value after a timeout, so the `done` callback would be called with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `Q.delay()` will delay the resolution of the promise by the specified number of milliseconds. In the original code, the promise was resolved
