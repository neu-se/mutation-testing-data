 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` only returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, causing an infinite loop when trying to consume the same operation in the following iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing 0 as the argument to `next()` will always return the first operation in the iterator, ignoring the length specified in the `while` loop condition, causing unexpected behavior in the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing -1 as the argument to `next()` will throw an error, as it is an invalid argument for the function. This would cause the `compose` method to fail, and the error would propagate up the call stack.

DONE.
