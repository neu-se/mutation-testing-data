  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ie' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the input word.

DONE.
