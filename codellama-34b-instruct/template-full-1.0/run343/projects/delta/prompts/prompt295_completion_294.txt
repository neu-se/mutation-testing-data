  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the next operation and potentially cause the algorithm to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the algorithm to consider one less operation than it should, potentially missing a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the algorithm to consider the negative of the next operation, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
