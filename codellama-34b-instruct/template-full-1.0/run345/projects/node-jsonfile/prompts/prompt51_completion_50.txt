  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, spaces)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different replacer function than the original one, which could change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument is different, which could change the spacing of the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces).slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the output of `JSON.stringify()` is sliced, which could remove the first character of the output.

DONE.
