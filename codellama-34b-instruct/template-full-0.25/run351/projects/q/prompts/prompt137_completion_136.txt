  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not a function, while this replacement checks if it is not an object.

DONE.
