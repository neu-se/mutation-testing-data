  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Timeout"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be a generic `Error` object with the message "Timeout" instead of a custom error object with the message "Timed out after " + ms + " ms" and the property "code" set to "ETIMEDOUT".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be `null` instead of a custom error object with the message "Timed out after " + ms + " ms" and the property "code" set to "ETIMEDOUT".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
404
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be the number 404 instead of a custom error object with the message "Timed out after " + ms + " ms" and the property "code" set to "ETIMEDOUT".

DONE.
