  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `read` variable, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `read + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `read` variable, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `read - 1`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `read` variable, while the modified code fragment returns the value of `read * 2`, which is a different value.

DONE.
