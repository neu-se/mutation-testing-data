Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { 're': 0, 'im': 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of throwing an error when the input is invalid, it would return a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to zero, potentially leading to incorrect calculations without notifying the user of the invalid input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of throwing an error, allowing the program to continue executing without handling the invalid input properly, which could lead to further errors down the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a generic error instead of a `SyntaxError`, which may not be caught by specific error handling mechanisms that are designed to handle `SyntaxError`, leading to unhandled exceptions in the code.

DONE.
