Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks the first element of the coordinates array instead of the entire array, which could lead to incorrect validation of the coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the coordinates array instead of the array itself, which would not validate whether the coordinates are actually an array or if it contains the correct number of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1] + point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates the sum of the two coordinates instead of checking if they are in an array, which would bypass the validation logic entirely and could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
