  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string, and it would be passed as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `"foo"` instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
