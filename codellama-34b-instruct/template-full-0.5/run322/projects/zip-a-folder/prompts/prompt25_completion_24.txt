  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to an empty object, regardless of the value of `archiverOptions`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the compression level to high, regardless of the value of `archiverOptions`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && { compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the compression level to high only if `archiverOptions` is not null or undefined.

DONE.
