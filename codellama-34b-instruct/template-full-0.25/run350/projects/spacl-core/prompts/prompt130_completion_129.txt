  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index < count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, which could cause the loop to skip over the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would be inclusive instead of exclusive, which could cause the loop to iterate one extra time and potentially access an element outside the bounds of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition would be one less than the original loop condition, which could cause the loop to iterate one less time and potentially miss the last element in the array.

DONE.
