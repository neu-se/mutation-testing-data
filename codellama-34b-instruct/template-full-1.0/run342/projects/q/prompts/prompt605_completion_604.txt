  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.apply(this, [op, deferred]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` takes two arguments, but the code fragment provides three arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(op, deferred);
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is called with two arguments, but the code fragment provides one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.call(this, op, deferred);
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is called with `this` as the context, but the code fragment provides `self` as the context.

DONE.
