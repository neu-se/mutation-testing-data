  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof process` would always return "object", making the entire expression evaluate to `true` regardless of whether `process` is `null` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `process` is always an object, so accessing its `domain` property would never result in a reference error. However, if `process.domain` is `null`, the expression would evaluate to `false`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `process.domain` is `undefined`, the expression would evaluate to `true`, whereas the original code would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
