  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object is not a promise, so it does not have a `value` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object is not a promise, so it does not have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` object is not a promise, so it cannot be wrapped in a `Q` promise.

DONE.
