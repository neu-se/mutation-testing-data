  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `dest` as the filename for the write stream, while the replaced code fragment uses an empty string as the filename. This would cause the write stream to be created with an invalid filename, which could result in errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `dest` as the filename for the write stream, while the replaced code fragment uses `undefined` as the filename. This would cause the write stream to be created with an invalid filename, which could result in errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `dest` as the filename for the write stream, while the replaced code fragment uses `null` as the filename. This would cause the write stream to be created with an invalid filename, which could result in errors or incorrect behavior
