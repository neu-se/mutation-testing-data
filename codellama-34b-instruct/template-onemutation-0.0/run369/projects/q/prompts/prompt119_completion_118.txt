  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` is a different function than `uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty)`. The former is a bound function that calls `hasOwnProperty` with the `this` value set to `Object.prototype`, while the latter is a function that calls `hasOwnProperty` with the `this` value set to the object being tested.

DONE.
