Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key] = this._queue;
```
This would result in different behavior because it only retrieves the first key from the queue instead of iterating over all keys, potentially leading to incomplete data processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of this._queue.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `values()` method, which may not iterate over the keys in the same order as expected, affecting the order of data being processed and written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key of Array.from(this._queue)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the queue, which could lead to unexpected side effects if the queue is modified during iteration, potentially causing data loss or corruption.

DONE.
