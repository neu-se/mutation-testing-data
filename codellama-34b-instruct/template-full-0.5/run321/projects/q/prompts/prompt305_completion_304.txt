  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement instead of incrementing, leading to a different set of values being passed to `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in `answerPs`, leading to a different set of values being passed to `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element of `answerPs` instead of the first, leading to a different set of values being passed to `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)`.

DONE.
