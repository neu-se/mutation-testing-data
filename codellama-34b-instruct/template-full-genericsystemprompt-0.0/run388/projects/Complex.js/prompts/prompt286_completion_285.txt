  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the real part of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of twice the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the imaginary part plus one, instead of the imaginary part itself.

DONE.
