  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `undefined` instead of a number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `NaN` instead of a number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would return `-1` instead of a number, which would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false` for all stack lines, even if they are internal frames.

DONE.
