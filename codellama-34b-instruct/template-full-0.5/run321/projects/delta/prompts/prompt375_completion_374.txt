  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(other.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(this.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method would be called with a different argument, potentially causing the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
