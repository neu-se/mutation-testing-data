  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Queue is closed"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.reject` to create a rejected promise, while the new code fragment uses `new Error` to create a plain error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(ends.promise.get("head"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.reject` to create a rejected promise with the value of `ends.promise.get("head")`, while the new code fragment uses `closed.promise.get("head")` to get the value of the `head` property of the `closed` promise, which may not be the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject(new Q.Deferred().promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.reject` to create a rejected promise,
