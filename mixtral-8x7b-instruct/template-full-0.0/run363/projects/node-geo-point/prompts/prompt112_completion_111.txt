 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause division by zero when the latitude is 90 or -90 degrees, which is not the case in the original `Math.tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
