  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number of writes in flight is less than or equal to zero, while this new code checks if it's greater than or equal to zero. If there are no writes in flight, this new code would evaluate to true, while the original code would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number of writes in flight is less than or equal to zero, while this new code checks if it's exactly equal to zero. If there are any writes in flight, this new code would evaluate to false, while the original code would evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the number of writes in
