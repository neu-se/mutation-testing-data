Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) 
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition from checking if `test(data)` is false to checking if it is true, which would cause the logic to behave incorrectly when the test function is expected to return false for certain data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional condition that will always evaluate to false, effectively making the entire condition false regardless of the result of `test(data)`, which would prevent the intended logic from executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for equality to true, which could lead to unexpected results if `test(data)` returns a truthy value that is not strictly `true`, thus altering the flow of the function.

DONE.
