  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would change the final value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(this['re']) * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be taking the square root of the real part of the complex number before multiplying it by `places`, which would change the final value.

DONE.
