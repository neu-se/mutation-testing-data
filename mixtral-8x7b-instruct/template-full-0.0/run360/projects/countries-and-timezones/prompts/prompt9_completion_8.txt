 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the `countries` array has a length of 0, instead of checking if it is falsy. This might not catch cases where `countries` is an empty array, but the original code would have returned early since an empty array is still considered truthy in JavaScript.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(countries) && countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if `countries` is an array and has a length of 0. This would cause the function to return early even if `countries` is an empty array, which is different from the original behavior where an empty array would still execute the `forEach` loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries && countries.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if
