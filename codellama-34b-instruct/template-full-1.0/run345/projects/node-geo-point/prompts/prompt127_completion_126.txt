  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", whereas `point` is a variable that may or may not be a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` returns a string representation of an object, whereas `point` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` returns a primitive value representation of an object, whereas `point` is a number.

DONE.
