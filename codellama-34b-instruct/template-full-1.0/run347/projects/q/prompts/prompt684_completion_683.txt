  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments array would be sliced with a different start and end index, which would change the values that are passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments array would be sliced with a different start index, which would change the values that are passed to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments array would be sliced and then reversed, which would change the order of the values that are passed to the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
