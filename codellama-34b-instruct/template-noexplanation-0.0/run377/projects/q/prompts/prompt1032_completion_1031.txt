  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
The original code fragment passes `null` as the first argument to the `nodeback` function, while the modified code fragment passes `error` as the first argument. This change in behavior could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `nodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, undefined)
```
This code fragment is different from the original code fragment, which was:
```
nodeback(null, error)
```
The original code fragment passes `null` as the first argument to the `nodeback` function, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined` as the first argument. This change in behavior could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `nodeify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, error)
```
