  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while the buggy code fragment only checks if `a` is equal to 0. This could lead to different results in certain cases, such as when `b` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are equal to 0, while the buggy code fragment checks if either `a` or `b` is equal to 0. This could lead to different results in certain cases, such as when `a` is not equal to 0 but `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior
