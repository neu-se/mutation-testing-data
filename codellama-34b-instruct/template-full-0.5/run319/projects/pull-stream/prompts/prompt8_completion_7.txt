  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources
```
This would result in different behavior because `sources` is a different object than `sinks`, and `exports` is being assigned to `sinks`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because `throughs` is a different object than `sinks`, and `exports` is being assigned to `sinks`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and `exports` is being assigned to `sinks`.

DONE.
