  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with the rejection reason as its argument, even if the rejection is handled by a `catch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is resolved with `undefined` instead of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a new promise that is rejected with a new error instead of the original promise.

DONE.
