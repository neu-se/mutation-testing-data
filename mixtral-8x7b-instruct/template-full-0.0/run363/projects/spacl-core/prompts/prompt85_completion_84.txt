 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule => ({ ...rule })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the rule instead of a deep copy, which may not correctly clone rule instances with nested properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule => Object.assign({}, rule)
