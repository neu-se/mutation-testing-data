Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("for testing purposes");
```
This would result in different behavior because the string output is slightly altered, changing the message from "for testing purpose" to "for testing purposes," which may affect any string comparison or logging expectations in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("testing purpose");
```
This would result in different behavior because the output string is changed entirely, which could lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the purpose of the code, potentially causing tests that rely on specific output to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("for debugging purposes");
```
This would result in different behavior because the message now indicates a different intent (debugging instead of testing), which could mislead developers or testers about the context in which the code is being executed.

DONE.
