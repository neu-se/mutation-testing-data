  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `dest` property is an empty string, rather than checking if it is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `dest` property has a length of 0, rather than checking if it is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `dest` property has a length greater than 0, rather than checking if it is falsy.

DONE.
