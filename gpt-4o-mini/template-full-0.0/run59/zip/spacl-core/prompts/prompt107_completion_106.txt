Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + path
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends a forward slash to the path, potentially altering the way the policy matches the path, leading to incorrect match results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + '/*'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a wildcard to the path, which may cause the match to succeed for paths that should not be matched according to the original policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the path to uppercase, which could lead to mismatches if the policy is case-sensitive, resulting in incorrect match results.

DONE.
