  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the difference between `r` and `a`, while this replacement uses the sum. This change would cause the method to return a different value for the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the difference between `r` and `a`, while this replacement uses their product. This change would cause the method to return a different value for the complex square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the difference between `r` and `a`, while this replacement uses their ratio. This change would cause the method to return a different value for the complex square root.

DONE.
