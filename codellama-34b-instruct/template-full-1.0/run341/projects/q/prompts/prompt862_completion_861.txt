  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.timeout(object, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method will reject the promise with an error after 0 milliseconds, whereas the original code does not have a timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value will be resolved by the promise, whereas the original code will reject the promise with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` method will create a new deferred object, which can be rejected, whereas the original code does not create a new deferred object.

DONE.
