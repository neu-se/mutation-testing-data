  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Number.isFinite`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the input is a finite number, and `false` when it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if the input is `NaN`, which is different from `Number.isFinite` which checks if the input is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInteger` checks if the input is an integer, which is different from `Number.isFinite` which checks if the input is a finite number.

DONE.
