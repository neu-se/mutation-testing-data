  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `await` would cause the code to wait for the promise to be resolved before executing the next line of code, whereas `this.dispatch` would simply call the function without waiting for it to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch()` would call the function without waiting for it to complete, whereas `await this.dispatch` would cause the code to wait for the promise to be resolved before executing the next line of code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch(null)` would pass `null` as the first argument to the `dispatch` function, whereas `await this.dispatch` would not pass any arguments.

DONE.
