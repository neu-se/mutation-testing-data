Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment> = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `deferred` variable to `null`, causing any subsequent calls to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to throw an error, leading to a failure in promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(42);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes a constant value `42` to the `defer` function, which may not be expected by the implementation, potentially causing the promise to behave incorrectly or reject unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `this` as the argument for `defer`, which may not be a valid context for the promise resolution, leading to unexpected behavior or errors during promise handling.

DONE.
