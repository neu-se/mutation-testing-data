  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if it is a string. If `op.retain` is an object, the original code fragment would return 1, while this new code fragment would return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is not null, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. If `op.retain` is not null, the original code fragment would return 1, while this new code fragment would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this new code fragment checks
