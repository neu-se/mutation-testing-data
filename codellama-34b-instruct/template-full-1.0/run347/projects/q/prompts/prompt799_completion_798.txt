  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value of `object`, which could break the code that relies on the return value of `Q.progress`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Some error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the given error message, which could cause the code that handles the rejection to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null` instead of the original value of `object`, which could break the code that relies on the return value of `Q.progress`.

DONE.
