  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would terminate the read stream, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would pass the `ended` argument to the callback, while the new code fragment `cb(ended, data)` would pass the `data` argument instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` would pass `null` as the first argument to the callback, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would pass `data` as the second argument.

DONE.
