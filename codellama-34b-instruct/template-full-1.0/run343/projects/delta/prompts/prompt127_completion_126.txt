  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first operation in the iterator, potentially causing the rest of the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(10000000000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over a large number of operations in the iterator, potentially causing the rest of the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a null pointer exception when calling the `next` method on the iterator.

DONE.
