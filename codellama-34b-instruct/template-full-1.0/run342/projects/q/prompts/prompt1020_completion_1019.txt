  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is a defined method in the `Promise` prototype, but `get` is not. Using `get` would result in a `TypeError` because `this.dispatch` would be called with an undefined method name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` would be called with the method name as its first argument, which would result in an infinite recursion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` would be called with the method name as its first argument, and `resolve` is a defined method in the `Promise` prototype. Using `resolve` would result in a different behavior than the original code, but it would not result in an error.

DONE.
