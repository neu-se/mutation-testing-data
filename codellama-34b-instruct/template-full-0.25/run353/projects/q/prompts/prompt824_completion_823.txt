  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, but this modified code fragment throws an error regardless of the type of the `callback` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Q.fcall()` to create a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the `progressed` function, but this modified code fragment uses `Q.then()` to create a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the `progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(function (value) {
    return value;
}, function (reason) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because
