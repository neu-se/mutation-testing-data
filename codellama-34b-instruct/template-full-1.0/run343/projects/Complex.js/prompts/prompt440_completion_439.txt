  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.floor` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers. While `Math.floor` rounds towards negative infinity, `Math.round` rounds towards zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive), while `Math.floor` and `Math.round` return an integer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` parses a string and returns an integer value, while `Math.floor` and `Math.round` perform mathematical operations on numbers.

DONE.
