 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the not-equal operator (`!=`) is replaced with the strict not-equal operator (`!==`). In this case, it might not affect the outcome, but if the `op.insert` value is a custom object with a `valueOf` method that returns `undefined`, the strict not-equal operator would evaluate to `false`, while the not-equal operator would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.hasOwnProperty('insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `insert` property exists in the `op` object, rather than checking if the value of the `insert` property is not null or undefined. This could lead to different behavior if the `op` object has an `insert` property with a falsy value, such as an empty string or `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.insert !==
