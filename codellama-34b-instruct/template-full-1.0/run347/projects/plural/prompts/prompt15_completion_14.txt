  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the resulting word to have twice the desired length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the resulting word to have one more letter than desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the resulting word to be three letters shorter than desired.

DONE.
