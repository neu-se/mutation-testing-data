 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` for the `gettype` function when the `pageurl` is `undefined` or an empty object, whereas the original code returns `null` only when `pageurl` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the `pageurl` variable in the global scope, whereas the original code uses the `pageurl` parameter of the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the `pageurl` variable in the current execution context (which could be different from the `gettype` function), whereas the original code uses the `pageurl` parameter of the `gettype` function.

DONE.
