  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] of this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment returns an iterator of values. This could cause issues if the test suite is not expecting the iterator to return key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] of this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator of keys, whereas the original code fragment returns an iterator of values. This could cause issues if the test suite is not expecting the iterator to return keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] of this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator of values, whereas the original code fragment returns an iterator of values. This could cause issues if the test suite is not expecting the iterator to return values
