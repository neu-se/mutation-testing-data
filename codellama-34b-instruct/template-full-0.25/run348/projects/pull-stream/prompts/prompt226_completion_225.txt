  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to return the opposite result of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) && data }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, which would cause the function to return `data` if `test(data)` is truthy, and `undefined` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) ? data : !test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is added, which would cause the function to return `data` if `test(data)` is truthy, and `!test(data)` otherwise.

DONE.
