  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays, while `push` adds new elements to the end of an array. In this case, `push` would modify the `baseArgs` array, which could have unintended consequences if the function is called multiple times.
