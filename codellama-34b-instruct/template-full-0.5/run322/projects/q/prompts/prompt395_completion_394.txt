  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which would change the behavior of the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the `this` context of the function to `null`, which would cause the `then` method to be called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the `this` context of the function to the first argument, which would cause the `then` method to be called with a different context. Additionally, passing an empty array as the second argument would cause the `then` method to be called with no arguments, which could change its behavior.

DONE.
