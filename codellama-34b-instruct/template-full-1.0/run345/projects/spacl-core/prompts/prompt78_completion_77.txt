  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let randRule of this.rules
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a rule from the policy's rule array, rather than iterating through the rules in order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through a copy of the rule array, rather than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the rule array in reverse order, rather than the original order.

DONE.
