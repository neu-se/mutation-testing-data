 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would receive `null` as its argument instead of a deferred object, causing the returned promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would receive an empty object as its argument instead of a deferred object, causing the returned promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function would receive a function as its argument instead of a deferred object, causing the returned promise to never resolve or reject.

DONE.
