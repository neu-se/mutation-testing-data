  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different object from `a`, and the `diff` function would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.foo` is a different property from `a`, and the `diff` function would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.bar` is a different property from `b`, and the `diff` function would return a different result.

DONE.
