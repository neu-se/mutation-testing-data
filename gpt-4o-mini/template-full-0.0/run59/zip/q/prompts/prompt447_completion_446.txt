Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would store the rejection reason instead of the promise itself, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value into the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which would not correctly represent the promise that was unhandled, leading to confusion in tracking.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the context of the current function (the promise object) instead of the promise that was passed to the `trackRejection` function, which could lead to incorrect handling of the rejection tracking.

DONE.
