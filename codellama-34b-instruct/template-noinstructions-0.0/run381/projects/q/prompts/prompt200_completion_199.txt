  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, as `e.stack` is not a valid property of the `Error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, as `e.stack` is not a valid property of the `Error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, as `e.stack` is not a valid property of the `Error` object.

DONE.
