  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is thenable, while `isPromise` is a function that checks if an object is a promise. The two functions have different behavior, and the change would result in the code handling thenables differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a function that checks if an object is a promise, while `isPromiseAlike` is a function that checks if an object is thenable. The two functions have different behavior, and the change would result in the code handling promises differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isThenable
```
This would result in different behavior because `isThenable` is a function that checks if an object is thenable, while `isPromise` and `isPromiseAlike` are functions that check if an
