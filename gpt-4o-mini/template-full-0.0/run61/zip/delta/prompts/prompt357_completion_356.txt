Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always transform the position to the start of the Delta, ignoring the actual index provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always move the index one position forward, potentially skipping over elements that should be transformed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform the position to the end of the Delta, rather than using the provided index, which could lead to incorrect transformations.

DONE.
