  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value and would cause the `timeout` function to reject the promise immediately, whereas `object` is a truthy value and would cause the promise to be fulfilled after the specified timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value and would cause the `timeout` function to reject the promise immediately, whereas `object` is a truthy value and would cause the promise to be fulfilled after the specified timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a truthy value and would cause the promise to be fulfilled after the specified timeout, whereas `object` is a truthy value and would also cause the promise to be fulfilled after the specified timeout.

DONE.
