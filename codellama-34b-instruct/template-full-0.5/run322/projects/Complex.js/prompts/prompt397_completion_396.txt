  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `asin` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `acos` would produce a different result than the original calculation of `asin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` and `asin` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `atan` would produce a different result than the original calculation of `asin`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acosh']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh` and `asin` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `acosh` would produce a different result than the original calculation of `asin`.

DONE.
