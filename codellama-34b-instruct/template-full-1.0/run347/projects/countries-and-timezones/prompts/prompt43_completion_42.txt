Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, [id]: getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the object's key from a string to an array. This would cause the `deliverCountry` function to fail when trying to access the `timezones` property, which is an object with string keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, (id): getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the object's key from a string to a function. This would cause the `getCountry` function to fail when trying to access the `id` property, which is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, [[id]]: getCountry(id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the object's key from a string to a matrix. This would cause the `getCountry` function to fail when trying to access the `id` property
