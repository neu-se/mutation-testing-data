  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the last element of the `ops` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all elements of the `ops` array except for the first and last elements, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
