  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref["name"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different property (name) of the reference rather than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * ref.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a different element of the reference each time it is called, rather than consistently using the first element.

DONE.
