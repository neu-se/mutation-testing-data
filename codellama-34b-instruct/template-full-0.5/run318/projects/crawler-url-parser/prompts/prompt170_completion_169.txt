  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domain of the link URL is equal to the domain of the page URL, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal. This would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value if the domains of the link URL and page URL are not the same, which could affect the overall behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain == pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the subdomain of the link URL is equal to the subdomain of the page URL, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal. This would cause the `gettype` function to return a different value if the subdomains of the link URL and page URL are not the same, which could affect the overall behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
