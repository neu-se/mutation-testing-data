 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be always resolved, even when an error occurs. The original code fragment rejects the promise in case of an error, which allows the error to be handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would not be called, and the error would not be propagated. Instead, an empty function would be called, effectively ignoring the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise.resolve` is not a function, and attempting to call it would throw an error. This would prevent the error from being propagated properly, and could cause the application to fail.

DONE.
