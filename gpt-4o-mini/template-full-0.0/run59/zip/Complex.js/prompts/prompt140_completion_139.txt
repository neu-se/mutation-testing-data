Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat the multiplication of two infinite complex numbers as valid, returning `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly handle the case where both numbers are zero, returning `Complex['NAN']` instead of the expected behavior for zero multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` when either the first number is infinite or the second number is zero, which changes the intended logic of handling infinite values in multiplication.

DONE.
