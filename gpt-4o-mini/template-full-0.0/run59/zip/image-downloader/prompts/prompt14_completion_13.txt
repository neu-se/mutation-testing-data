Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the filename to uppercase, which may not match the original filename's case, potentially leading to issues with file handling on case-sensitive file systems.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename + '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a '.jpg' extension to the filename regardless of the original file type, which could cause problems if the file is not actually a JPEG.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the file extension from the filename, which could lead to incorrect file naming and potential overwriting of files with the same base name but different extensions.

DONE.
