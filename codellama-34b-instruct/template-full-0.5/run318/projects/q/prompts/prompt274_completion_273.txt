  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a string, whereas `error` is an object. The `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, which is typically an object or an Error instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.stack` is a string that represents the stack trace at the point where the error was thrown, whereas `error` is an object that contains the error message and other information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.name` is a string that represents the name of the error, whereas `error` is an object that contains the error message and other information.

DONE.
