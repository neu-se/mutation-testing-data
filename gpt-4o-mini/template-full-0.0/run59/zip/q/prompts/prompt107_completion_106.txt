Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to attempt to access an index that is out of bounds (equal to `this.length`), potentially leading to an `undefined` value being compared to `value`, which could result in incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < this.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also attempt to access an index that is out of bounds (one past the last valid index), which could lead to incorrect comparisons and potentially returning an incorrect index or `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < this.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last element of the array during the search, meaning that if the value being searched for is located at the last index, it would not be found, resulting in a return value of `-1` even if the value exists in the array.

DONE.
