  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ops}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Delta.ops property to be evaluated as an object instead of an array, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected results in the code that uses this property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ops: ops }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Delta.ops property to be evaluated as an object with a single property named "ops" instead of an array, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected results in the code that uses this property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[ops]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Delta.ops property to be evaluated as an array instead of an object, which could potentially cause errors or unexpected results in the code that uses this property.

DONE.
