Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('An error occurred:', e);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the error, it logs the error to the console and resolves the promise, which means the calling code would not be notified of the failure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve('Error handled');
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a message instead of rejecting it, which would mislead the caller into thinking the operation was successful when it actually encountered an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Custom error message'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it always rejects the promise with a fixed custom error message, regardless of the actual error that occurred, which could obscure the original error context.

DONE.
