Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with `null` instead of the actual result, which could lead to unexpected behavior in promise chains that rely on the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with `undefined`, which is different from resolving it with the actual result, potentially causing issues in subsequent `.then()` calls that expect a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with a string "error" instead of the actual result, which could mislead consumers of the promise into thinking the operation was successful when it was not.

DONE.
