  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not the same as the one in the original code fragment, which could cause the function to return different results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is different from the original code fragment, which could cause the function to return different results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\
