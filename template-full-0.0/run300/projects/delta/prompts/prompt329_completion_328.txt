  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain || op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `op.retain` is truthy, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `op.attributes` is falsy, regardless of the value of `op.retain`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain ? op.attributes : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `op.retain` is falsy, regardless of the value of `op.attributes`.

DONE.
