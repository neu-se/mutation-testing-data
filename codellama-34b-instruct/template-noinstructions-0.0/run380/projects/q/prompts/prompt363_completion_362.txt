  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is in the progress state instead of a fulfilled or rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a fulfilled promise with the value `undefined` instead of the original value.

DONE.
