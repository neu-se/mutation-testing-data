  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the `PolicyMap` class:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`.
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `false` for any policy that has a `null` value for the `path` property, even if the `path` property is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined`.
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `false` for any policy that has an `undefined` value for the `path` property, even if the `path` property is not `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `path.substring(1)`.
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would return `false` for any policy that has a `path` property that does not start with the same character as the `path` parameter.

DONE.
