  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call the `onUnhandledError` function with `null` as the argument, rather than passing the function as the argument to `process.domain.bind`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately call the `onUnhandledError` function with `null` as the `this` context and no arguments, rather than passing the function as the argument to `process.domain.bind`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to `null` as the `this` context, rather than passing the unmodified `onUnhandledError` function as the argument to `process.domain.bind`.

DONE.
