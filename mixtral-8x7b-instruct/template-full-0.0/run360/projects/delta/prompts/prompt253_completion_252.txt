 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `insert` property from the `thisOp` object instead of the `opLength` variable. This change would cause the function to behave differently when comparing operations, potentially causing unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(opLength, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.max` function to ensure that the `opLength` value is never less than 1. This change could cause the function to behave differently when comparing operations, potentially causing unexpected results, especially when dealing with operations that have a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the next operation from the `otherIter` object instead of the `opLength` variable. This change would cause the function to behave differently
