  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl` object is not guaranteed to have a `url` property, whereas the `pageurl` variable is guaranteed to be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl` object is not guaranteed to have a `host` property, whereas the `pageurl` variable is guaranteed to be a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pageurl` object is not guaranteed to have a `pathname` property, whereas the `pageurl` variable is guaranteed to be a string.

DONE.
