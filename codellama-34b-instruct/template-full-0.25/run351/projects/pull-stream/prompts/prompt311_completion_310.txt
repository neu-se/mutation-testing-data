  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `null` is a constant. In the context of the code, `data` is expected to be a non-null value, and the function will not work correctly if it is replaced with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `data`, and the function will not work correctly if it is replaced with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `data`, and the function will not work correctly if it is replaced with `0`.

DONE.
