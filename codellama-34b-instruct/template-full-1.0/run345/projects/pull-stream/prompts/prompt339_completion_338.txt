  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field + 1` expression would always be truthy, and the `seen[key]` check would always be false, causing the function to return `true` for every input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field - 1` expression would always be falsey, and the `seen[key]` check would always be `true`, causing the function to return `false` for every input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field == null` check would always be false, causing the function to return `true` for every input, regardless of the `seen[key]` value.

DONE.
