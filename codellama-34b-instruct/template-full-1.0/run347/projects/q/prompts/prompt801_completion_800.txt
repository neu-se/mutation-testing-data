  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with the fixed value `12345` instead of the value passed to `Q.progress`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with `null` instead of the value passed to `Q.progress`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would not be called at all, as `undefined` is not a function.

DONE.
