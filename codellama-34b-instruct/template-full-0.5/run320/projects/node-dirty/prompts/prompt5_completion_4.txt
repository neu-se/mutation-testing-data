  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would not be able to store the key-value pair with a `null` key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would not be able to store the key-value pair with an `undefined` key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Map` object would not be able to store the key-value pair with a string key.

DONE.
