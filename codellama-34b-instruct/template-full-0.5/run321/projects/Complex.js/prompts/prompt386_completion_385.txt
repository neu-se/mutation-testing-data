  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is called with a different argument.

DONE.
