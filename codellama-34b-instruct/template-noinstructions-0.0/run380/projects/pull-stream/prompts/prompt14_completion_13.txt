  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the `args` array to be accessed out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element of the `arguments` array, potentially causing the `args` array to be incomplete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < length + 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing the `args` array to be accessed out of bounds.

DONE.
