Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to dispatch on `null`, which would likely lead to a runtime error or unexpected behavior, as `null` is not a valid object to operate on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to dispatch on `undefined`, which would also lead to a runtime error or unexpected behavior, as `undefined` cannot be used as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would attempt to dispatch on a string literal, which is not a valid object for the dispatch method, potentially causing errors or incorrect results when trying to access properties or methods on a string.

DONE.
