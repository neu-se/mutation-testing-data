  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is not called, and the resulting regex would not match the expected paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not called, and the resulting regex would not match the expected paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parts` array is not joined, and the resulting regex would not match the expected paths.

DONE.
