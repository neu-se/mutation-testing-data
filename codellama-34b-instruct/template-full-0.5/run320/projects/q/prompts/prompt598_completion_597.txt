  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
