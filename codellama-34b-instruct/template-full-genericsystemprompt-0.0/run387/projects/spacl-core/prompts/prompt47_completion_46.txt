  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` matches any number of characters, including zero, whereas the original `.+` matches one or more characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{2,}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.{2,}` matches two or more characters, whereas the original `.+` matches one or more characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.{2}/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.{2}` matches exactly two characters, whereas the original `.+` matches one or more characters.

DONE.
