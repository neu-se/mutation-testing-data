  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will add 1 to the value of `data`, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `data` through unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator will multiply the value of `data` by 2, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `data` through unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator will subtract 1 from the value of `data`, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `data` through unchanged.

DONE.
