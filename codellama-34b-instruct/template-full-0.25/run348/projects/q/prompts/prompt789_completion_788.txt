  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.bind(this)` would create a new function that, when called, would call `this.then` with the original `this` context, whereas `this.then` would call `this.then` with the new `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.call(null)` would call `this.then` with a `null` context, whereas `this.then` would call `this.then` with the original `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then.apply(null)` would call `this.then` with a `null` context and no arguments, whereas `this.then` would call `this.then
