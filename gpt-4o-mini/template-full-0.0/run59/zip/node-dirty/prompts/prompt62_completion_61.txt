Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_readStream` to be destroyed immediately without properly closing the stream, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `destroy` method would not properly handle the stream closure, which could lead to unhandled errors or resource leaks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would not trigger the expected cleanup process for the `_readStream`, potentially leaving the stream in an inconsistent state and causing subsequent operations to fail.

DONE.
