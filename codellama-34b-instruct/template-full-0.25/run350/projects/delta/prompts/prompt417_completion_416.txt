  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the iterator to peek at the next operation without advancing to it, which may be useful in certain situations but could also lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.skip()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to skip over the next operation, which may be useful in certain situations but could also lead to unexpected behavior if not used carefully.

DONE.
