  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the this iterator instead of the other iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the minimum of the lengths of the two iterators instead of the length of the this iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
