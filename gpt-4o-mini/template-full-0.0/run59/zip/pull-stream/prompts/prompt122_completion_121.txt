Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `sink` function would not trigger the processing of the `source`, effectively skipping any data handling and potentially leading to an undefined accumulator value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `sink` function would also prevent any data from being processed, similar to passing `null`, but it may lead to different error handling or unexpected behavior in the reducer function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `data` instead of `source` would cause the `sink` function to process the current data value directly, rather than the source stream, which could lead to incorrect accumulation of results.

DONE.
