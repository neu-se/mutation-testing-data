  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `if (stream && 'object' === typeof stream)` check would fail and the `stream` variable would not be assigned the result of the `once` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `nextChunk` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `if (stream && 'object' === typeof stream)` check would fail and the `stream` variable would not be assigned the result of the `once` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `nextChunk` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is a truthy value, so the `if (stream && 'object' === typeof stream)` check would pass and the `stream` variable would be assigned the
