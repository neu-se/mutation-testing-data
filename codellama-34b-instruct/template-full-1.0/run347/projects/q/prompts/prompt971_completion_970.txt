  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the argument to be a list, while this code fragment would convert it to a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the argument to be a list, while this code fragment would create a new list with the same elements as the original argument, except for the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the argument to be a list, while this code fragment would cause it to be null.

DONE.
