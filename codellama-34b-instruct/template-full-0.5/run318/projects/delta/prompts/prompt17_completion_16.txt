  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's property values, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable and non-enumerable property names.

DONE.
