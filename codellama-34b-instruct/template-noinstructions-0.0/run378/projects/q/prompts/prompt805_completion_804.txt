  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](callback())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a parameter to the `finally` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"](function () { return callback; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be wrapped in a new function, which would not have the same behavior as passing the `callback` function directly to the `finally` method.

DONE.
