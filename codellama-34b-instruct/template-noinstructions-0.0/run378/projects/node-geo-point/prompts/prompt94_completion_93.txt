  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `sinφ2` can have values outside of this range.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `sinφ2` can have values outside of this range.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` expects a value between -1 and 1, while `sinφ2` can have values outside of this range.

DONE.
