  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a non-null value, but `null` is a null value. The difference is that `null` would not have the same properties or methods as the original value, which could affect how the code behaves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a non-undefined value, but `undefined` is a undefined value. The difference is that `undefined` would not have the same properties or methods as the original value, which could affect how the code behaves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a non-object value, but `{}` is an empty object. The difference is that `{}` would have different properties and methods than the original value, which could affect how the code behaves.

DONE.
