  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `ended`, causing the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` if both `ended` and `!end` are `true`, causing the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if either `ended` or `!end` are `true`, causing the `cb` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
