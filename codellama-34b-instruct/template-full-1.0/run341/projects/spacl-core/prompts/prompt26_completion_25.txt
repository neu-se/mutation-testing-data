  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would capture an additional case where `min` is equal to 1, which would not match the original code's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would capture an additional case where `min` is not equal to 1, which would not match the original code's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(min & 1) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would capture an additional case where `min` is even, which would not match the original code's logic.

DONE.
