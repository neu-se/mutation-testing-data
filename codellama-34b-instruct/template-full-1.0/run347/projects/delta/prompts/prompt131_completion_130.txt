  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object, instead of the entire object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(Delta.length(nextOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the length of the `nextOp` object, instead of the object itself.

DONE.
