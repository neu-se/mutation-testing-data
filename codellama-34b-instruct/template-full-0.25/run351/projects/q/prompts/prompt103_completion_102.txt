  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the array instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value 0 to the current element in the array instead of accessing it.

DONE.
