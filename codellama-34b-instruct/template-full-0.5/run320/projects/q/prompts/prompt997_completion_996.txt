  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err, value) {
  deferred.reject(err);
  deferred.resolve(value);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected and resolved at the same time, which is not allowed in the Q library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err, value) {
  deferred.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the function call was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err, value) {
  deferred.resolve(value);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value, even if the function call was unsuccessful.

DONE.
