  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `Promise` prototype, while the buggy code fragment is a method call on the `Promise` instance. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the `Promise` instance is not the same as the `Promise` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a method call on the `Promise` prototype, while the buggy code fragment is a method call on the `Promise` instance, but with the `this` context bound to the `Promise` instance. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when the `Promise` instance is not the same as the `Promise` prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
