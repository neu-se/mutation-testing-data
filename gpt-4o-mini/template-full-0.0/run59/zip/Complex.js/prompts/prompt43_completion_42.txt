Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is exactly zero, which would return `true` for `a = 0` but `false` for `a = undefined` or `a = null`, leading to a different handling of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== undefined && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of `a` instead of its absence, meaning that the code block would execute when `a` is defined and not null, which is the opposite of the original condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality to check if `a` is either `null` or `undefined`, which would allow for a broader match than the original strict checks, potentially leading to unexpected behavior when `a` is a falsy value like `0` or `false`.

DONE.
