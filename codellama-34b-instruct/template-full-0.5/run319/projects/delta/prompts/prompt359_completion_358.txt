  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `priority` value, causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `priority` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `arg` value, causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `arg` is less than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the `arg` value, causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `arg` is less than 2.

DONE.
