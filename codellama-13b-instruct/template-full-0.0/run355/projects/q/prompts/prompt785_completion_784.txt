  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` function would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
