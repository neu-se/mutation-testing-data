  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `process.emit` method is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `process.emit` method is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `process.emit` method is not called with the correct arguments.

DONE.
