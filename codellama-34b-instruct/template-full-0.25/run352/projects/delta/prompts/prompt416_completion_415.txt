  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `length`, causing the loop to iterate in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as many times, potentially causing the loop to take longer to execute.

DONE.
