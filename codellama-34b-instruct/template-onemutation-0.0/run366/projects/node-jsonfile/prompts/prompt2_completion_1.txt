  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that reads the entire contents of a file into memory, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of a file asynchronously. Using `fs.readFileSync` in this context would cause the function to block until the entire file is read, which could lead to performance issues and potential deadlocks.
