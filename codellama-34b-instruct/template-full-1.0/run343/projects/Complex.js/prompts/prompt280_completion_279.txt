  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a + 1```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, and `Math.atan2(b, a)` computes the arc tangent of `b` divided by `a`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. In contrast, `a + 1` adds 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the `Complex` constructor and lead to a different complex number being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a - 1```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `a` refers to the real part of the complex number, and `Math.atan2(b, a)` computes the arc tangent of `b` divided by `a`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. In contrast, `a - 1` subtracts 1 from the real part of the complex number, which would change the result of the `Complex` constructor
