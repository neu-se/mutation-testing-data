  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if the `end` argument is falsy, but this new code fragment would call it regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function as is, but this new code fragment passes a modified version of `data` that is one greater than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function as is, but this new code fragment passes a modified version of `data` that is all uppercase.

DONE.
