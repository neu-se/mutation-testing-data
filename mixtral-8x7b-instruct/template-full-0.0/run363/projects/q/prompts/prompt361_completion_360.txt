 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved promise would be rejected instead, causing the chained `.then` to trigger the rejected handler instead of the fulfilled handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve the promise of the promise, which is not allowed and would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the progress handler instead of the fulfilled handler, which may not be expected by the calling code.

DONE.
