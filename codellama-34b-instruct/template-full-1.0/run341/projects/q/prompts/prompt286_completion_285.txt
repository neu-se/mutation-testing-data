  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver != "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of a value as a string, while the `!=` operator is a comparison operator that checks for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolver.isFunction()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` is a method that checks if a value is a function, while `!=` is a comparison operator that checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver() != "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator calls the function, while `!=` is a comparison operator that checks for strict equality.

DONE.
