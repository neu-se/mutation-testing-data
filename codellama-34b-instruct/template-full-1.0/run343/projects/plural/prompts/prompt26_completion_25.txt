  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in the code returning the wrong pluralization for words that end in -us, such as "bus" becoming "buses" instead of "bus."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0]
```
This would result in the code returning the wrong pluralization for words that end in -us, such as "atus" becoming "ates" instead of "ate."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in the code returning the wrong pluralization for words that end in -us, such as "kus" becoming "kuss" instead of "kus."

DONE.
