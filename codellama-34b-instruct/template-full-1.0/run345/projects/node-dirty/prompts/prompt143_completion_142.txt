  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Something is wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a new error with a generic message, which would not be captured by the existing error handling logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error with the same message as the original error, but with a falsy value for the third argument, which would cause the `emit` function to return a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error with the same message as the original error, but with a truthy value for the third argument, which would cause the `emit` function to return a truthy value.

DONE.
