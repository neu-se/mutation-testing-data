  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the unencoded basename instead of the decoded basename, which could result in a different file name being used for the destination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the full pathname instead of the basename, which could result in a different file name being used for the destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the pathname from the URL instead of the basename, which could result in a different file name being used for the destination.

DONE.
