  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but the new code fragment checks if `abort` is `false`. This change would cause the `onEnd` callback to be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
