Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout + 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the delay by an additional 1000 milliseconds, causing the promise to resolve later than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the delay to half of the original timeout, potentially causing the promise to resolve sooner than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the delay to zero milliseconds, causing the promise to resolve immediately instead of waiting for the specified timeout.

DONE.
