  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` and `a['phi']` have different values and would make the `Complex` constructor return a different object.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` and `a['phi']` have different values and would make the `Complex` constructor return a different object.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` has no relation to `a['phi']` and would make the `Complex` constructor return a different object.

DONE.
