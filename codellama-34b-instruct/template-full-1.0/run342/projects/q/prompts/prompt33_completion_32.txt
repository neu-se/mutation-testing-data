  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would not be called, which could cause unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would not be called, which could cause unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called but would not have any effect, which could cause unintended consequences.

DONE.
