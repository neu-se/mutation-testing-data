  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = allResolved;
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = function () { return Q.reject(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always reject the promise, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = function (promises) { return Q.resolve(promises); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always resolve the promise with the input promises, regardless of their states.

DONE.
