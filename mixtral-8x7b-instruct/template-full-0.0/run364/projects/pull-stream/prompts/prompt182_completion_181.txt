 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` argument is not passed to the `abortCb` function, which might cause it to behave differently or throw an error if it relies on the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` function is not passed to the `abortCb` function, which might cause it to behave differently or throw an error if it relies on the `onAbort` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument is not passed to the `abortCb` function, which might cause it to behave differently or throw an error if it relies on the `onAbort` argument.

DONE.
