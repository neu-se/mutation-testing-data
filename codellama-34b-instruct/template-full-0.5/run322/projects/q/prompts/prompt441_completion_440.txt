  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.call(process, "unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `emit` method of `process` with the given arguments, whereas the original code would only call `emit` if it was a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit.call(process, "unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `emit` method of `process` with the given arguments, whereas the original code would only call `emit` if it was a function.
