 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include parentheses, so the `inspect` method is not called. By adding parentheses, the `inspect` method would be invoked, which could potentially lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` returns the current value of the promise, while `inspect` returns an object with information about the promise's state. By replacing `inspect` with `valueOf`, the code would return a different value, potentially causing tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
resolvedPromise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that can be used to register callbacks for fulfillment or rejection of the promise. By replacing `inspect` with `then`, the code would no longer return information
