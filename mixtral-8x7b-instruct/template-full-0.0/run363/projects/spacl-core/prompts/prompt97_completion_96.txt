 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
<any>name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the query method, regardless of the policy's existence, since `<any>name` will never be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get(<any>name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to get a policy with the name of `<any>name`, which might not exist, and then try to call the `query` method on the result. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get(name)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assume that the policy is an array and try to access the first element, which might not exist. This could lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
