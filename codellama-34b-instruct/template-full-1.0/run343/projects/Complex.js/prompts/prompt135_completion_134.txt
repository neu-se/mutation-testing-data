  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['sign']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sign` method returns the sign of a complex number, while the original code fragment uses the `isInfinite` method to check if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['sign']
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['sign']` returns the sign of the second complex number, while the original code fragment uses the `isInfinite` method to check if the first complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `isInfinite` method to check if the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is infinite.

DONE.
