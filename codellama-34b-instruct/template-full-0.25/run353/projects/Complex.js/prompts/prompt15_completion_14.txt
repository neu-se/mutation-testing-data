  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple variable reference, while `x + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `x`. This change would cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value for certain inputs, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple variable reference, while `x * 2` is an expression that multiplies `x` by 2. This change would cause the `cosm1` function to return a different value for certain inputs, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a simple variable reference, while `x - 1` is an
