This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array with the second argument onwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the third argument onwards, instead of an array with the second argument onwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the first argument onwards, instead of an array with the second argument onwards.

DONE.
