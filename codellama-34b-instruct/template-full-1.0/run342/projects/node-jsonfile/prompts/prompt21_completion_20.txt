  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `readFileSync` function to try to read the "foo" file instead of the intended file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `readFileSync` function to try to read a file with the name [1, 2, 3] instead of the intended file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `readFileSync` function to try to read a file with the name "null" instead of the intended file.

DONE.
