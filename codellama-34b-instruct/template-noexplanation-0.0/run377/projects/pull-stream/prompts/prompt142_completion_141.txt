  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(1)
```
This change will cause the `generate` function to be called with the argument `1`, which may produce a different result than calling it with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(Math.random())
```
This change will cause the `generate` function to be called with a random number as an argument, which may produce a different result than calling it with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generate(end)
```
This change will cause the `generate` function to be called with the `end` argument, which may produce a different result than calling it with no arguments.

DONE.
