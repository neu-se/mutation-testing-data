  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` checks the next element in the other iterator, whereas `thisIter.hasNext` checks the next element in the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `!thisIter.hasNext` checks if there are no more elements in the current iterator, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` checks if there are more elements in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'` checks if the current element in the current iterator is not an insert, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` checks if there are more elements in the other iterator.

DONE.
