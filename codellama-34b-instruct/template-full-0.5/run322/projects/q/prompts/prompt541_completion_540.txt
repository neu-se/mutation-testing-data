  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1
```
This would result in different behavior because "void 1" is a truthy value, while "void 0" is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because "null" is a falsy value, while "void 0" is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is a falsy value, while "void 0" is a truthy value.

DONE.
