  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a different method than `then`, and it would not handle fulfilled promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a different method than `then`, and it would not handle fulfilled promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `then`, and it would not handle fulfilled promises.

DONE.
