  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start from the next character instead of the current one, which could lead to unexpected results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start from the previous character instead of the current one, which could lead to unexpected results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `substr` method to start from twice the current offset instead of the current offset, which could lead to unexpected results in some cases.

DONE.
