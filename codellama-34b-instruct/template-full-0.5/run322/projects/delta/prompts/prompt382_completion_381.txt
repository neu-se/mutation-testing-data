  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
