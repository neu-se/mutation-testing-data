 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns only the own enumerable and non-enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.keys` returns only the own enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['constructor', ...Object.keys(attributes)];
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the `constructor` property to the resulting array, which can cause unexpected behavior when iterating over the keys or when filtering null values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(attributes).filter(key => attributes[key] !== null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the keys with null values from the resulting array, which can cause some attributes to be missing in the final object.

DONE.
