  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object as its first argument, but `true` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object as its first argument, but `"hello"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function expects an object as its first argument, but `_fs.readFileSync` is a function.

DONE.
