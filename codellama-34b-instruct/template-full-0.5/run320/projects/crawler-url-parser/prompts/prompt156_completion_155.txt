  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path component and the trailing slash, while the new code fragment replaces the last path component with a backslash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path component and the trailing slash, while the new code fragment replaces the last path component with two backslashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last path component and the trailing slash, while the new code fragment replaces the last path component with three backslashes.

DONE.
