  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` would be called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would end the output stream instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the program to exit early.

DONE.
