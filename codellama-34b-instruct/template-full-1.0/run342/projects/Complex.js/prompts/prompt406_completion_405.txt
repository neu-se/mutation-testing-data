  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the given angle, while `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the given angle, while `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of the given angle, while `Math.atan2` returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments.

DONE.
