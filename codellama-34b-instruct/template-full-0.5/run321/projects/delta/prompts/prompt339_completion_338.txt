  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseIndex` would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different portion of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseIndex` would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `slice` method to return a different portion of the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseIndex` would be unchanged, which could cause the `slice` method to return the same portion of the base delta as before.

DONE.
