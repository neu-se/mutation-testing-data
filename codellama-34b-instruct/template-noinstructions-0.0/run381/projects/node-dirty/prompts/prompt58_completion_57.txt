  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Drain event not emitted'));
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be emitted immediately, rather than waiting for the `drain` event to be emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with a different argument, which could cause the event listener to behave differently.

DONE.
