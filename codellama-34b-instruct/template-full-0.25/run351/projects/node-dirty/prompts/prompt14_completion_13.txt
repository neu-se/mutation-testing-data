  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the callback function to the `cbs` array, but it would not execute the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb)();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the callback function to the `cbs` array and execute it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the callback function to the `cbs` array and then immediately flush the queue, which would cause the callback function to be executed immediately.

DONE.
