  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(Math.floor(length), Math.floor(thisIter.peekLength() / 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is at least half the length of the current op, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(Math.ceil(length), Math.floor(thisIter.peekLength() / 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is at least half the length of the current op, and it would also always round up to the nearest integer, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.
