  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments, which could potentially cause issues if the function is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with a single argument of `true`, while this new code fragment calls it with a single argument of `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with a single argument of `true`, while this new code fragment calls it with no arguments.

DONE.
