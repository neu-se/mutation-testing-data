  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both objects and strings, while this replacement only checks for strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number' && nextOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both objects and numbers, while this replacement only checks for numbers greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both objects and functions, while this replacement only checks for functions.

DONE.
