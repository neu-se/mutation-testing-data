  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the current operation, rather than just the length of the current operation minus the length of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the next operation, rather than just the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + Op.length(otherOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the sum of the lengths of the current and next operations, rather than just the length of the current operation.

DONE.
