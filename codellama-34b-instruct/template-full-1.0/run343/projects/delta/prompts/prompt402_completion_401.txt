  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical not operator (`!`) will invert the result of the comparison, leading to a potentially incorrect result when evaluating the conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherData !== embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator will return the type of the value as a string, whereas the `embedType` variable is a string that represents the type of the embed. This would lead to a potentially incorrect result when evaluating the conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== typeof otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the type of the embed is not equal to the type of the `otherData` value, which may not match the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
