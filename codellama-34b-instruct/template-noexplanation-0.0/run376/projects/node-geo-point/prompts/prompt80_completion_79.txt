  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This code fragment replaces the original `deg2rad(coordinate.longitude)` with a simple addition of the two longitude values, which is a buggy behavior as it does not take into account the conversion from degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This code fragment replaces the original `deg2rad(coordinate.longitude)` with a simple subtraction of the two longitude values, which is a buggy behavior as it does not take into account the conversion from degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This code fragment replaces the original `deg2rad(coordinate.longitude)` with a simple multiplication of the two longitude values, which is a buggy behavior as it does not take into account the conversion from degrees to radians.

DONE.
