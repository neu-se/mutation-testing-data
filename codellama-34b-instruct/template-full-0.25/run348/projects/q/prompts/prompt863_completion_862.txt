  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be increased by 1 millisecond, which could cause the promise to be rejected later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be decreased by 1 millisecond, which could cause the promise to be rejected earlier than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected immediately, regardless of the timeout value.

DONE.
