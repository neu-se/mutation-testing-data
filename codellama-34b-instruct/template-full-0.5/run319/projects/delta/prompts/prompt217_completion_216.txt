  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `other.ops` array instead of a slice of the array, which could cause the `concat` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `other.ops` array instead of a slice of the array, which could cause the `concat` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from the second element instead of the first element, which could cause the `concat` method to behave differently.

DONE.
