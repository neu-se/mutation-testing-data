 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const verb = 'any';
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `verb` variable with a string 'any', instead of iterating over the `verbs` object properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const verb = Object.keys(this.verbs)[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it always selects the first verb in the `verbs` object, instead of iterating over all the verbs provided to the `clone` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
const verb = Object.values(this.verbs)[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it always selects the first value (true or false) in the `verbs` object, instead of iterating over all the verbs provided to the `clone` method.

DONE.
