  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, while this modified code calculates the distance between two points plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, while this modified code calculates the distance between two points multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between two points, while this modified code calculates the distance between two points divided by 2.

DONE.
