  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length - 1
```
This will cause the code to access the last element of the `ops` array instead of the first element, which is the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length + 1
```
This will cause the code to access the element after the last element of the `ops` array, which is not a valid operation and will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length * 2
```
This will cause the code to access the element at twice the index of the last element of the `ops` array, which is not a valid operation and will result in an error.

DONE.
