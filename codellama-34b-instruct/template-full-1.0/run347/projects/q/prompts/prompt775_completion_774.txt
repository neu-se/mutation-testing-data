  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER in line 136 can be replaced with:
```
await
```
This would result in different behavior because await is a asynchronous operator, which would result in the code to wait for the designated promise to resolve before continuing execution.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER in line 136 can be replaced with:
```
awaited
```
This would result in different behavior because awaited is a non-existant operator, which would result in a syntax error and the test would fail.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER in line 136 can be replaced with:
```
Q.then
```
This would result in different behavior because Q.then is a promise method, which would execute the callback function when the promise resolves. However, this would not wait for the designated promise to resolve before continuing execution.

DONE.
