  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, rather than the `head` property. This could potentially cause the method to return a different value than expected, and could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Queue` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head" + "tail"
```
This change will cause the `get` method to return the concatenation of the `head` and `tail` properties of the `ends.promise` object, rather than just the `head` property. This could potentially cause the method to return a different value than expected, and could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Queue` object.
