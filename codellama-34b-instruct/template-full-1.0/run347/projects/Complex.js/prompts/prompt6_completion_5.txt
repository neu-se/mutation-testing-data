  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has |-x| < 1e-9, which ensures the exponentially is close to zero, preventing exp() from overflowing. However, the replaced code fragment |-Math.exp(x)| > 1e-9 for large values of x, causing exp() to overflow and produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has x < 1e-9, which ensures the argument of the exponential function is close to zero, preventing exp() from overflowing. However, the replaced code fragment has x > 1e-9 for large values of x, causing exp() to overflow and produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 1
