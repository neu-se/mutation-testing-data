  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is missing the backslash before the `$1`, which would cause the first captured group to be interpreted as a literal string instead of a reference to a captured group.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is missing the backslash before the `$1`, which would cause the first captured group to be interpreted as a literal string instead of a reference to a captured group.
