 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
100
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the method call with a constant number, which would always return 100 as the length, regardless of the actual length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'length'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the method call with a string, causing a runtime error when the code tries to use it as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `peekLength` method with the `nextLength` method, which returns the length of the next operation instead of the current one. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the `diff` method, as it might skip over operations or misinterpret the length of the current operation.

DONE.
