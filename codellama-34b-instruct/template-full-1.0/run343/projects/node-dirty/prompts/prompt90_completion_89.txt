  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a custom error message, while the original code would not emit any error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a size that is one larger than the actual size of the data, while the original code would emit the correct size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close', () => {
  this._readStream = null;
  this.emit('write_close');
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a `read_close` event with a callback function that sets the `_readStream` property to `null` and emits a `write
