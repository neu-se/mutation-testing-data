Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it shifts the starting index by 1 and extends the length by 1, potentially causing an off-by-one error when slicing the base, leading to incorrect operations on the Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a subtraction instead of addition for the length, which would result in a negative index, causing the slice to return an empty array or throw an error, thus altering the expected behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length, baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the indices, effectively slicing the base in the wrong direction, which could lead to incorrect operations being performed on the Delta, such as missing or incorrectly applying operations.

DONE.
