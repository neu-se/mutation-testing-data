 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `TimeoutError` is not thrown anymore, and the error handling does not occur as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(error) => console.error(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is logged instead of being propagated and caught by the `reject` handler, causing the test to not fail when it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(error) => setTimeout(() => console.error(error), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is asynchronously logged, which might not be caught by the test in time, causing the test to not fail when it should.

DONE.
