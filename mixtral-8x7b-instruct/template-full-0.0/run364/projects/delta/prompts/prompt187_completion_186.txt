 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` method would return `undefined` when the `handler.compose` call returns `null`. The original `Delta.getHandler` is guaranteed to return a valid handler, but replacing it with `null` would cause the `compose` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
