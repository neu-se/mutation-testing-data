  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.substr()` method returns a new string starting from the specified position, so it would remove the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.substring()` method returns a new string starting from the specified position and ending at the specified position, so it would also remove the first character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.charAt()` method returns the character at the specified position, so it would only remove the first character of the string if the position is set to 0.

DONE.
