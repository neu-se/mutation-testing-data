  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks for the presence of a value, while the `==` operator checks for equality. In the original code, the `typeof` operator is used to check if the `href` variable is undefined, but the `==` operator is used to check if the `href` variable is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length <= 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used to get the length of a string, but the `length` property is not defined for null or undefined values. In the original code, the `length` property is used to check if the `href` variable is less than 3 characters long, but if the `href` variable is null or undefined, the `length` property will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
