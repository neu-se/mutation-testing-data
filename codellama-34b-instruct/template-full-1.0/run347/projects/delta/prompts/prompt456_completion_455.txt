  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length - this.index` is always 0 or negative, while `this.index` can be any positive integer. This change would cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are remaining operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length - this.offset` may be 0 or negative, while `this.index` can be any positive integer. This change would cause the `rest()` method to return an array of operations that have been skipped over, potentially resulting in a different order of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.index - this.offset` is always 0 or negative, while `this
