  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `false` if `resolvedPromise` is `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `resolvedPromise` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if `resolvedPromise` is `true`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `resolvedPromise` is `false`.

DONE.
