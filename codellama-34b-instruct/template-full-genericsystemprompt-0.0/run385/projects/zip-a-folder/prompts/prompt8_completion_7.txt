  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the source and target folders to be the same, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the target base path to the source path in uppercase, which would not match if the source path contains any lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the target base path includes the source path as a substring, which would always be true if the source path is a subdirectory of the target base path.

DONE.
