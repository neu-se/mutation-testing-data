  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the given code with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)[dispatch].call("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is not a property of the `Q` function, so attempting to access it as such will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).invoke("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because `invoke` is not a method of the `Promise.prototype` and will result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).send("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because `send` is not a method of the `Promise.prototype` and will result in an error.
