  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the truthiness of `nodeback`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `nodeback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would call the `nodeback` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method would call the `nodeback` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.nextTick`.

DONE.
