  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause a runtime error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.log` function is used to calculate the natural logarithm of the product of `a` and `b`, rather than the `logHypot` function used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(Math.hypot(a, b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.hypot` function is used to calculate the hypotenuse of the complex number `a + bi`, rather than the `logHypot` function used in the original code.

DONE.
