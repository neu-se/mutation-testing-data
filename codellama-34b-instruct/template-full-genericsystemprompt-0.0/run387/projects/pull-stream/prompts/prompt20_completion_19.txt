  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[1]`, which is the second element of the `args` array, instead of `ref[0]`, which is the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]`, which is the third element of the `args` array, instead of `ref[0]`, which is the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[3]`, which is the fourth element of the `args` array, instead of `ref[0]`, which is the first element.

DONE.
