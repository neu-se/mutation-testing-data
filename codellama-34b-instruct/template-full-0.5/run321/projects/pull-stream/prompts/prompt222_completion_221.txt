  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would change the type of the argument being passed to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"null"` is a string, and it would change the type of the argument being passed to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that represents "not a number", and it would change the type of the argument being passed to the `cb` function.

DONE.
