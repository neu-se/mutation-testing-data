  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation, rather than the current operation, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the previous operation, rather than the current operation, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next two operations, rather than the current operation, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
