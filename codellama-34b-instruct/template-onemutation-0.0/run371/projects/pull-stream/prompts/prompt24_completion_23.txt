  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the index is `1`, but in the mutated code, it is `2`. This could cause the function to access a different value from the array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
