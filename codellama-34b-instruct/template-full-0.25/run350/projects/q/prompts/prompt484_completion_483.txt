  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a shallow copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a shallow copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, but with only the last element included.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a shallow copy of the `unhandledReasons` array, but with the first element removed.

DONE.
