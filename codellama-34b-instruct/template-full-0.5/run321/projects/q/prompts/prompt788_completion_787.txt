  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while replacing it with `null` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` when trying to call `then` on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while replacing it with `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` when trying to call `then` on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original promise, while replacing it with `Q.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `Q.reject` error when trying to call `then` on it.

DONE.
