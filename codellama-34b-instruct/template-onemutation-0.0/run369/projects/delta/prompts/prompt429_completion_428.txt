  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` when the length is 1, even though there is still an operation available.

DONE.
