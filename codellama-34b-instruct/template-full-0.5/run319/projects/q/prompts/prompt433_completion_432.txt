  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the code execute the `if` block if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `false`, and the `else` block if it's `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `trackUnhandledRejections` is not `false`, which would always be `true` since the variable is a boolean.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition twice, making the code execute the `if` block if `trackUnhandledRejections` is `true`, and the `else` block if it's `false`.

DONE.
