  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be `exception` instead of `_rejected(exception)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the fulfilled value would be `value` instead of `_fulfilled(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(_progressed(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress value would be `_progressed(value)` instead of `value`.

DONE.
