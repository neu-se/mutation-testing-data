  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, regardless of the `deprecated` option passed to the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the non-deprecated timezones, regardless of the `deprecated` option passed to the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` option passed to the `getTimezonesForCountry` function, which would result in different timezones being returned.

DONE.
