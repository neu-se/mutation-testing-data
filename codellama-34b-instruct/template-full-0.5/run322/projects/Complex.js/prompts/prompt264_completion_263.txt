  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the argument passed to the `Math.atan2` function, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the argument passed to the `Math.atan2` function, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the argument passed to the `Math.atan2` function, which would affect the calculation of the complex number's argument.

DONE.
