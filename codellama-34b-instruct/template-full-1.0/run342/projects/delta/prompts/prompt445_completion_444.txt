  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `this.ops` array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `this.index` variable itself as the index instead of the `this.ops[this.index]` expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a null reference error when trying to access the `this.ops[this.index]` expression.

DONE.
