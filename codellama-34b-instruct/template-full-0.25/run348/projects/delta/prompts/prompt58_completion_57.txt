  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray` would return `true` for any value that is not an array, whereas `Array.isArray` would return `false` for any value that is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(null)` would return `false`, whereas `!Array.isArray` would return `true` for `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(undefined)` would return `false`, whereas `!Array.isArray` would return `true` for `undefined`.

DONE.
