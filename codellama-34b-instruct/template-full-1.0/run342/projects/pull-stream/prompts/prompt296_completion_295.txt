  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if both `ended` and `end` were truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and `ended` is falsy. This could cause the function to terminate early in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if both `ended` and `end` were truthy, while the new code fragment checks if either `ended` or `end` are truthy. This could cause the function to terminate early in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ^ end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if both `ended` and `end` were truthy, while the new code fragment performs a bitwise XOR operation on `ended` and `end`. This could cause the function to terminate early in some cases.
