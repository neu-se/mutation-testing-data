  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which only requires one condition to be true. This change would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be used as the base URL in cases where the `parsedUrl.host` is null, which could result in different URLs being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not check the length of the `baseUrlStr`, while the new code fragment does. This change would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be used as the base URL only if it is not an empty string, which could result in different URLs being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.
