  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.when` function to fail because it expects a promise as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.when` function to fail because it expects a promise as its first argument, but `null` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q.when` function to fail because it expects a promise as its first argument, but an error object is not a promise.

DONE.
