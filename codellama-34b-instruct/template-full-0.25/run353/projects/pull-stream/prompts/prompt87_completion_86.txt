  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!cb` checks if `cb` is falsy, while `cb !== null` checks if `cb` is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!cb` checks if `cb` is falsy, while `typeof cb === 'function'` checks if `cb` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!cb` checks if `cb` is falsy, while `cb.length > 0` checks if `cb` has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
