  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `bind` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different effects on the `this` keyword. In this case, using `call` would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `this` value set to the global object, rather than the `continuer` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `bind` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different effects on the `this` keyword. In this case, using `apply` would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `this` value set to the global object, rather than the `continuer` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior
