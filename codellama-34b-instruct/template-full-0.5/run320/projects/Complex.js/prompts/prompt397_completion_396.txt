  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `asin` have different ranges and output values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` and `asin` have different ranges and output values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the output to be reversed.

DONE.
