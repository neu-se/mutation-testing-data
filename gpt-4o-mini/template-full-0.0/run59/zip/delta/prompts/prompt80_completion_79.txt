Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assume that `lastOp` is an object, leading to the insertion of `newOp` even when it should not be, potentially corrupting the operation sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat `null` as a valid object, allowing the code to execute the block that pushes `newOp` even when `lastOp` is not a valid operation, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `lastOp` is an array instead of an object, which would always return false for the expected operation types, thus preventing the insertion of `newOp` when it should be allowed.

DONE.
