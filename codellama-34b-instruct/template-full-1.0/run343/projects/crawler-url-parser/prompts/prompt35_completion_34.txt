  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would return the first character of the string, rather than the entire string, which could cause issues with the surrounding code that relies on the full URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring operation would return a substring of the string, starting from the second character, rather than the entire string, which could cause issues with the surrounding code that relies on the full URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the split operation would return the first part of the string, separated by the '.' character, rather than the entire string, which could cause issues with the surrounding code that relies on the full URL string.

DONE.
