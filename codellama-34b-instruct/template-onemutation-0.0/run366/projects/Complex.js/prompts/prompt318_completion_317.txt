  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` refers to the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment `a` refers to the real part. This would cause the `sinh` function to use the wrong value, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
