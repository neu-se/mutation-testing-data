  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire operation instead of just the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength, otherOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the specified length and also apply the attributes from the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength, AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the specified length and also apply the difference in attributes between the two operations.

DONE.
