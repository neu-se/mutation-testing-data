  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be called with the `resolve` option set to `true`, which means that the URL would not be resolved against the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `resolve` option set to `true`, but the `parse` option would be set to `false`, which means that the URL would be resolved against the base URL, but the resulting URL would not be parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would be called with the `resolve` option set to `false`, but the `parse` option would be set to `true`, which means that the URL would not be resolved against the base URL,
