  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return "object" for a function, and the code would proceed to execute `bootstrap("promise", definition)`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return "function" for a function, and the code would not execute `bootstrap("promise", definition)`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return "undefined" if `bootstrap` is not defined, and the code would not execute `bootstrap("promise", definition)`, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
