  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter++;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `longStackCounter` variable, which is used to track the number of stacks in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter--;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `longStackCounter` variable, which is used to track the number of stacks in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `longStackCounter` variable, which is used to track the number of stacks in the promise chain.

DONE.
