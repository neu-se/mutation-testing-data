  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `peek` method without parentheses, which would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `peek` method without an argument, which would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `peek` method with an argument of `1`, which would result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
