Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled || rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the `progress` handler, which means that any progress notifications sent by the promise will not be handled, potentially leading to missed updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled && rejected && progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical AND operator, which will only execute if all three handlers are provided, effectively ignoring the promise resolution if any of them are missing, leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, void 0, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly sets the `rejected` handler to `void 0`, meaning that any rejection of the promise will not be handled, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections and potential crashes in the application.

DONE.
