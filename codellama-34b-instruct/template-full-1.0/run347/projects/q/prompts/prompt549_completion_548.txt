  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the first promise, whereas the original code would return the value of the first fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, whereas the original code would return true only if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value !== undefined && result.value !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, whereas the original code would return true only if the promise is fulfilled with a value that is not false.

DONE.
