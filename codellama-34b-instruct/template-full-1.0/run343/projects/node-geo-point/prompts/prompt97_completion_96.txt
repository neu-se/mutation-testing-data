  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is a local variable that is not defined in the `calculateDestination` function. The `calculateDestination` function would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access a variable that is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the GeoPoint and the longitude of the coordinate, instead of the bearing between the GeoPoint and the latitude of the coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(Ï†2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the GeoPoint and the cosine of the latitude of the coordinate, instead of the bearing between the GeoPoint and the latitude of the coordinate.

DONE.
