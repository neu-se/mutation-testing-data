Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `countries` array is empty instead of checking if it is `null` or `undefined`, which may lead to cases where valid but empty country arrays are incorrectly processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for `null` instead of falsy values, meaning that if `countries` is an empty array (which is falsy), the condition would not trigger, potentially allowing the code to proceed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(countries)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `countries` is not an array, which would allow the function to skip processing for any non-array type, potentially leading to unexpected results if `countries` is an object or other non-array type.

DONE.
