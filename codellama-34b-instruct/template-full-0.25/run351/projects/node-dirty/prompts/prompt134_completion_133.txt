  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the data object, whereas the original code fragment would only delete the key from the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to undefined in the data object, whereas the original code fragment would only delete the key from the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to null in the data object, whereas the original code fragment would only delete the key from the queue.

DONE.
