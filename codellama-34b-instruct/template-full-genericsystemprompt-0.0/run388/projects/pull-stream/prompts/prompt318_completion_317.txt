  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `null` as the first argument, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `data` as the first argument, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `null` as both arguments, regardless of whether the test passed or failed.

DONE.
