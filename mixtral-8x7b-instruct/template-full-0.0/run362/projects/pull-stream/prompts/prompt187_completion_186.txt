 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `false` as the first argument to the callback, instead of the original `true` or `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the current index as the first argument to the callback, instead of the original `true` or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
