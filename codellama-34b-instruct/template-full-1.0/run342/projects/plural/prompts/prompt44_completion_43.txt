  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring of the original word that starts from the second letter, rather than the first letter, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring of the original word that is twice as long as the original word, rather than the intended substring of the first two letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring of the original word that starts from the third letter, rather than the intended substring of the first two letters.

DONE.
