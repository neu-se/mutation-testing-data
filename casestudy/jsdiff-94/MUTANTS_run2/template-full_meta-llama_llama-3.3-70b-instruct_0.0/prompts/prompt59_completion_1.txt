Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline && newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if both old and new strings have a newline at the end, instead of checking for the absence of a newline in either string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
oldEOFNewline || newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the old or new string has a newline at the end, instead of checking for the absence of a newline in either string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!oldEOFNewline && newEOFNewline
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the old string does not have a newline at the end and the new string does, which is a different condition than the original code.

DONE.
