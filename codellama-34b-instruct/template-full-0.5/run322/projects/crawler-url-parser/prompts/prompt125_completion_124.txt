  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the new code checks if it is an object. This could cause the function to behave differently if `linkurl` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the new code checks if it is an object using strict equality. This could cause the function to behave differently if `linkurl` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.constructor === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, but the new code checks if its constructor is an object. This could cause the function to behave differently if `linkurl` is not a string.

DONE.
