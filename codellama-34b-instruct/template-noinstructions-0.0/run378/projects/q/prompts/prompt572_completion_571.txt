  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have a `dispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `object.dispatch()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `dispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `object.dispatch()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have a `dispatch` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `object.dispatch()`.

DONE.
