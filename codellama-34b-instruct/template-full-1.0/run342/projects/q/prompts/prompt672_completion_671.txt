  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
q
```
This would result in different behavior because `q` is not the same as `Q`, and it is likely that the author intended to use `Q` in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is not a valid method for a `promise` object, and it is likely that the author intended to use a valid method such as `Q.resolve()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` is not a `promise` object, and it is likely that the author intended to use a `promise` object in this context.

DONE.
