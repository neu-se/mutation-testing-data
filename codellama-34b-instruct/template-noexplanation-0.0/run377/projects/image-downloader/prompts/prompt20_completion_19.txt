  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative
```
This code fragment is different from the original `path.isAbsolute` in that it checks if the path is relative instead of absolute. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This code fragment is different from the original `path.isAbsolute` in that it checks if the `options.dest` path is absolute instead of checking if the `options.url` path is absolute. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently and may reveal weaknesses in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest) && path.isAbsolute(options.url)
```
This code fragment is different from the original `path.isAbsolute` in that it checks if both the `options.dest` and `options.url
