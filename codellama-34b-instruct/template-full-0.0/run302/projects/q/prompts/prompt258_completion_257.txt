  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `value`. This means that the promise returned by `become` would be resolved with a promise that is resolved with `value`, rather than being resolved with `value` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which in this case is `undefined`. This means that the promise returned by `become` would be resolved with a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, rather than being resolved with `value` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject(value); });
```
