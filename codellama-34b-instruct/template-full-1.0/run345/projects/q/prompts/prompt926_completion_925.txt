  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause an error when trying to invoke it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not a function and will cause an error when trying to invoke it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}.undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}.undefined` is not a function and will cause an error when trying to invoke it.

DONE.
