  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, replacing it with `index > 0` would check if the index is positive, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, replacing it with `index === 0` would check if the index is equal to 0, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, replacing it with `index !== 0` would check if the
