  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance
```
This would result in different behavior because `distance` is a different value than `bearing`, and the calculation for `φ2` and `λ2` would be based on a different input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because `θ + 90` is a different angle than `θ`, and the calculation for `φ2` and `λ2` would be based on a different angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a different value than `θ`, and the calculation for `φ2` and `λ2` would be based on a different input.

DONE.
