  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "b + 2"
This would result in different behavior because the updated code would not have the same constant coefficient as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "b * 3"
This would result in different behavior because the updated code would have a different coefficient than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "b\*b"
This would result in different behavior because the updated code would not have the same calculation as the original code.

DONE.
