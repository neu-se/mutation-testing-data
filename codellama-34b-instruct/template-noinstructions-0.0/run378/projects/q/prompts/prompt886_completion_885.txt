  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `[].slice` is a method that returns a shallow
