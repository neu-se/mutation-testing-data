 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally advances the `thisIter` iterator, even when the current operation type is 'delete'. The original code only advances the iterator when the current operation type is 'insert'. This change could cause the `compose` method to skip over delete operations in certain cases, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>thisIter).next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a type assertion to call the `next` method on the `thisIter` iterator without checking if it actually exists. This could lead to a runtime error if the `thisIter` object does not have a `next` method. The original code does not use type assertions and relies on the actual type of the `thisIter` object to determine if the `next` method can be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
