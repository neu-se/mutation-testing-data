  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|quiz/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "thesis" and "crisis" while the new code fragment matches "quiz" as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "thesis" and "crisis" while the new code fragment matches "thesis" twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis|thesis|crisis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "thesis" and "crisis" while the new code fragment matches "thesis" and "crisis" twice.

DONE.
