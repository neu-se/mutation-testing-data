  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trim()` method removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to misinterpret the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method converts all characters in a string to lowercase, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to misinterpret the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `join()` methods are used to remove spaces from the stack trace, which could cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to misinterpret the stack trace.

DONE.
