  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a function as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while the new code fragment passes `null`. This could cause the function to be called with an unexpected argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
