  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is called with a second argument of `2`, which would skip the first two arguments of the `Q.post` invocation and return an array containing only the remaining arguments. This could cause the code to behave differently if the function being invoked expects to receive these arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is called with a third argument of `1`, which would return an array containing only the first argument of the `Q.post` invocation. This could cause the code to behave differently if the function being invoked expects to receive multiple arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is called with a third argument
