  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].inactived
```
This would result in different behavior because `inactived` is not a valid property of the `tzs` object, whereas `deprecated` is a valid property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always include the timezone in the result, regardless of its deprecated status.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated != true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always exclude the timezone from the result, even if it is not deprecated.

DONE.
