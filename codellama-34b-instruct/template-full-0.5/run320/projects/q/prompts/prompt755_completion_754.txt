  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = allResolved;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, and the `Q.allResolved` property is being reassigned to a non-existent function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = function () {
    throw new Error("Q.allResolved is deprecated");
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.allResolved` function is being reassigned to a function that throws an error, causing any code that uses `Q.allResolved` to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = function () {
    return Q.all([]);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.allResolved` function is being reassigned to a function that returns a promise that is already resolved with an empty array,
