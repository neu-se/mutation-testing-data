  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the first rule in the list to the given word, rather than the second rule as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the constant value 42, rather than applying any rule from the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the third rule in the list to the given word, rather than the second rule as intended.

DONE.
