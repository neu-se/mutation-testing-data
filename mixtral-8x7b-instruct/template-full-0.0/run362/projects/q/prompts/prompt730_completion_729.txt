 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is supposed to accept a value that represents the progress of the promise, but passing `null` would not provide any meaningful information about the progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(123)
