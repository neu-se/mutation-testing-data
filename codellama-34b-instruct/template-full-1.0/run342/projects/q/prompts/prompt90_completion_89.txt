  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code always return a string instead of a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code always return the number 1 instead of a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code always return a new function instead of a function.

DONE.
