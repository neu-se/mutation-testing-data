  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the previous operation is a delete operation and has no attributes, rather than checking if it is a retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && (typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' || lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the previous operation is a retain operation or has attributes, rather than checking if it is a retain operation with no attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.insert === 'string' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the previous operation is an insert operation with attributes, rather than checking if it is a retain operation with no attributes.

DONE.
