  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is using the `substr` method to extract a substring from the input word, and the `0` index is used to indicate the start of the substring. Changing the index to `-1` would result in the method returning the substring starting from the end of the input word, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is using the `substr` method to extract a substring from the input word, and the `1` index is used to indicate the start of the substring. Changing the index to `1` would result in the method returning the substring starting from the second character of the input word, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is using the `substr` method to extract a substring from the input word, and the `2
