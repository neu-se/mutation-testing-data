  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\_[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the underscore is not correctly escaped, causing the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+\)([a-z.]+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now capturing a different group of characters after the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default./[a-z]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now matching the string "default." followed by any character and then the letter "a" to "z" at the end of the string.

DONE.
