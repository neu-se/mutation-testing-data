  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` will return a string representation of the object, while `obj` will return the object itself. This change could potentially cause issues with the `JSON.stringify()` method, which expects an object as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it will not have the same properties or methods as the original `obj` object. This change could potentially cause issues with the `JSON.stringify()` method, which expects an object as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and it will not have the same properties or methods as the original `obj` object. This change could potentially cause issues with the `JSON.stringify()` method, which expects an object as its first argument.

DONE.
