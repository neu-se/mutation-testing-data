 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would not include the unhandled reason as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would include an empty object as the unhandled reason, instead of the actual error stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would include the entire array of unhandled reasons, instead of just the most recent one.

DONE.
