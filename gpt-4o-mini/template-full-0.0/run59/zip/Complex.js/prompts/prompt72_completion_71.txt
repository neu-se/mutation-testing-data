Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `tokens` array is empty instead of checking if `tokens` is `null`, which would allow the code to proceed even if there are no tokens, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `tokens` is `undefined` instead of `null`, which would not catch cases where `tokens` is an empty array or a valid array, thus allowing the parsing to continue incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality (`==`) instead of strict equality (`===`), which would evaluate to `true` for both `null` and `undefined`, potentially masking other issues in the parsing logic.

DONE.
