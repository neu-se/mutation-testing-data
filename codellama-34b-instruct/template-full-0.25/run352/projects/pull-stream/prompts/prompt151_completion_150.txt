  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments, but the original code only passes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass a fourth argument to `abortCb`, but the modified code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `undefined` as the fourth argument to `abortCb`, but the modified code passes `null`.

DONE.
