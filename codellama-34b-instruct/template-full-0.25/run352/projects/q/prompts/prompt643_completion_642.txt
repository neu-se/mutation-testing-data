  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the `dispatch` method is reversed, which could cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause the method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
