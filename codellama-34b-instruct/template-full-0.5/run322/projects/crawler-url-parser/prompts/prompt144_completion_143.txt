  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression makes the match case-insensitive, so the regular expression would match `/index.html`, `/INDEX.HTML`, `/index.hTmL`, etc.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression makes the match global, so all occurrences of the regular expression in the string would be replaced, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression makes the match multi-line, so the regular expression would match the end of each line in the string, not just the end of the
