  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther ---=== 0 &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `firstOther` is `null` before accessing its properties, but the replaced code does not. If `firstOther` is `null`, the replaced code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `firstOther.attributes` is `null`, but the replaced code checks if it is a string `'null'` instead. If `firstOther.attributes` is an object with a `toString` method that returns `'null'`, the replaced code would behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain ===
