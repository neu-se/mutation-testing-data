  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `done` variable, which means that the `if` statement would be evaluated as `if (end === true ? null : !done)` instead of `if (end === true ? null : done)`. This would cause the `done` callback to be called with a non-null value if `end` is not `true`, even if the `done` variable is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `done` variable, which means that the `if` statement would be evaluated as `if (end === true ? null : done + 1)` instead of `if (end === true ? null : done)`. This would cause the `done` callback to be called with a non-null value if `end` is not `true`, even if the `done` variable is `true`.

Option 3:
