  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const _ = data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is never assigned a value, so the code would always throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const _ = options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.reviver` is not defined, so the code would always throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const _ = () => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `()` is not a valid JSON object, so the code would always throw a `SyntaxError`.

DONE.
