  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the currentUrlStr variable would be null, causing the parse function to return null regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the baseUrlStr variable would be null, causing the parse function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the currentUrl variable would be null, causing the line `currentUrl.url = URL.format(parsedUrl)` to throw an error.

DONE.
