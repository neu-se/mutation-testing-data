  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `progress` argument is increased by 1, which could cause the callback to be called with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `progress` argument is multiplied by 2, which could cause the callback to be called with a different value than expected.

DONE.
