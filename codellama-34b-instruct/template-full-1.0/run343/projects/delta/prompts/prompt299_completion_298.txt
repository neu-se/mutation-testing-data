  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(0, "\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a newline character at the beginning of the line, which is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(line.length(), { bold: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire line with a bold attribute, meaning that the next line would not be considered correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(line.length());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire line, which would cause the next line to start at the wrong position.

DONE.
