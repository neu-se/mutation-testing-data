  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would result in a different value than the original `-` operator, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would result in a different value than the original `+` operator, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would result in a different value than the original `-` or `+` operators, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
