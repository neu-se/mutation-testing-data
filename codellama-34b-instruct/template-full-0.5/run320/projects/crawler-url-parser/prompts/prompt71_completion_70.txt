  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `.replace()` method, which would cause the test to fail if the `base` element's `href` attribute contains a semicolon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').split("=").length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `.split()` method, which would cause the test to fail if the `base` element's `href` attribute contains a query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').indexOf("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `.indexOf()` method, which would cause the test to fail if the `base` element's `href` attribute contains a query string.

DONE
