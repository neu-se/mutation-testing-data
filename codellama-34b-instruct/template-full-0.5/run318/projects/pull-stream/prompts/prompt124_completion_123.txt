  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` before calling `cb`, while the new code decrements `i` before calling `cb`. This change would cause the function to return a different value for `i` than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` before calling `cb`, while the new code always returns `0` for `i`. This change would cause the function to return a different value for `i` than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` before calling `cb`, while the new code always returns `max` for `i`. This change would cause the function to return a different value for `i` than the original code.
