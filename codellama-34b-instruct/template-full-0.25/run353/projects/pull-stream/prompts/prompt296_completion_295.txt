  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), while this replacement uses the logical OR operator (`||`). This means that the new code fragment will evaluate to `true` if either `ended` or `!end` is `true`, whereas the original code fragment will only evaluate to `true` if both `ended` and `!end` are `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), while this replacement uses the logical NOT operator (`!`) and the logical AND operator (`&&`). This means that the new code fragment will evaluate to `true` if `ended` is `false` and `end` is `true`, whereas the original code fragment will only evaluate to `true` if both `ended` and `end` are `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended ?
