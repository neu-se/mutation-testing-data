  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns `null` if the pattern is not found in the string, and the `!==` operator checks for inequality. Therefore, this replacement would cause the code to behave differently if the pattern is not found in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns `undefined` if the pattern is not found in the string, and the `===` operator checks for equality. Therefore, this replacement would cause the code to behave differently if the pattern is not found in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method returns `false` if the pattern is not found in the string, and the `===` operator checks for equality. Therefore
