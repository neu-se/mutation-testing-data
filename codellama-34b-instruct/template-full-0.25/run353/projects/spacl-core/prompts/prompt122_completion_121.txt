  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether a pattern exists in a string, while `match` is a method that returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that returns the index of the first match of a pattern in a string, while `match` returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a pattern in a string with a replacement string, while `match` returns an array of matches.

DONE.
