 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object is not being passed to the `dispatch` method, which could cause issues in handling the asynchronous operation's result or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer({})
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is passed as the first argument to the `fail` method instead of the `deferred.promise` object. This could cause the error handling mechanism to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` method is called without any arguments, and the `promise` property is accessed directly. This could cause issues if the `defer` method relies on the provided arguments to initialize the `deferred` object correctly.

DONE.
