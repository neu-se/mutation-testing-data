  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is now being converted to a string using the `toString()` method, which may produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is now being accessed using the `length` property, which may produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is now being converted to uppercase using the `toUpperCase()` method, which may produce unexpected results.

DONE.
