 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise.prototype.del` method expects a key as an argument, and null would not be a valid property key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'use strict'` directive would cause an error in the line `Promise.prototype.del = // XXX legacy Promise.prototype["delete"] =` since you cannot assign a property to a `null` value in strict mode.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the meaning of the statement by introducing an arrow function expression that does not return a function reference. The `Promise.prototype.del` method expects a function reference, and the arrow function would not provide that.

DONE.
