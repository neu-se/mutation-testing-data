  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be pushed onto the `delta` array, which would add a `null` operation to the delta, which would cause the `invert` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `insert` property of the null operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be pushed onto the `delta` array, which would add a `undefined` operation to the delta, which would cause the `invert` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `insert` property of the undefined operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` string would be pushed onto the `delta` array, which would add a `foo` operation to the delta, which would cause the `invert` method to throw an error when
