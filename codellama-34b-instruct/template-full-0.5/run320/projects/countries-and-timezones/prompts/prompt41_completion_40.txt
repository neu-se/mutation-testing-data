  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would start with an initial value of 1 instead of 0, which could affect the final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would double the value of `prev` instead of adding 1, which could affect the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would subtract 1 from the value of `prev` instead of adding 1, which could affect the final result.

DONE.
