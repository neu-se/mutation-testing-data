  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the operation data and base operation data, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the base operation data and operation data, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert only the operation data, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
