  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return the `id` function if the `mapper` argument is null, which is different from the original behavior where the `map` function would return a new function that applies the `mapper` function to the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return the `id` function if the `mapper` argument is undefined, which is different from the original behavior where the `map` function would return a new function that applies the `mapper` function to the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== mapper
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return the `id` function if the `mapper` argument is not equal to itself, which is different from the original behavior where the `map` function would return a new function that applies the `mapper` function
