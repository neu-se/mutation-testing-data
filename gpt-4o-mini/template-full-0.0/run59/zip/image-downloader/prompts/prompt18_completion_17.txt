Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the original basename of the URL instead of the decoded basename, which may lead to incorrect file names if the URL contains encoded characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, 'defaultImage.png'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the dynamic filename with a static default filename, which means that all images would be saved with the same name regardless of their original names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to use `null` as the filename, which would likely cause an error when trying to save the file, as opposed to generating a valid filename based on the URL.

DONE.
