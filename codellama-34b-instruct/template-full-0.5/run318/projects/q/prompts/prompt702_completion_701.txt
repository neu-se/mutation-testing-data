  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` returns a reversed version of the array, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_concat` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating all the arrays and/or values passed as arguments, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
