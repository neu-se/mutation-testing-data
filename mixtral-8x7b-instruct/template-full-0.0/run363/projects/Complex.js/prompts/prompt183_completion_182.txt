 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now return a result when the exponent is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part, whereas the original code fragment correctly returns early when the exponent is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the case where the real part of the exponent is zero, whereas the original code fragment checks if the entire exponent is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the case where the imaginary part of the exponent is positive, whereas the original code fragment checks if it is zero.

DONE.
