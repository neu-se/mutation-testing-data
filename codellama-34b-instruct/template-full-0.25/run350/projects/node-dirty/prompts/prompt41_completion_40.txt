  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would change the value of the `key` variable, potentially causing the `get` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'1'` string would be concatenated to the `key` variable, potentially causing the `get` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `key` variable to uppercase, potentially causing the `get` method to return a different value than expected.

DONE.
