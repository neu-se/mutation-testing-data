  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "href" attribute of the current element, which may not be the same as the value of the "href" attribute of the "a" element being processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the current element, which may not be the same as the value of the "href" attribute of the "a" element being processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href").split("?")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the "href" attribute of the current element, but without any query parameters.

DONE.
