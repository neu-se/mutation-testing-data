  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to receive the wrong arguments, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to receive the wrong arguments, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to receive the wrong arguments, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
