  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true for the resulting expression to be true. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical OR operator (`||`), which requires only one of the conditions to be true for the resulting expression to be true. This means that if `parsedUrl.host` is null, the replacement code fragment will always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `baseUrlStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator (`&&`), which requires both conditions to be true for the resulting expression to be true. In contrast, the replacement code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (`!=`), which requires the condition to be false for the resulting expression to be true. This means that if `parsedUrl.host` is not null, the replacement
