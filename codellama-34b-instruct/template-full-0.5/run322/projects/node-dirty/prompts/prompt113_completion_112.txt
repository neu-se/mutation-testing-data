  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of 0, which is different from the original code where the value is the size of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value that is one more than the actual size of the data, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value that is one less than the actual size of the data, which could cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
