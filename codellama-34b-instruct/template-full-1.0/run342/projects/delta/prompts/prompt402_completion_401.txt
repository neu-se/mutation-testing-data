  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check whether `embedType` is not equal to the first key of `otherData`, rather than checking for equality. This could cause the `handler.transform` method to be called with different arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(otherData)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check whether `embedType` is equal to the second key of `otherData`, rather than the first key. This could cause the `handler.transform` method to be called with different arguments, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length > Object.keys(otherData).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check whether `embedType
