  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `path` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the `path` matches the `regex` pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `path` string starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the `path` matches the `regex` pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `path` string on the `/` character and return the last element of the resulting array, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the `path` matches the
