  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) || isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number. In this case, the code is checking if the real or imaginary part of the complex number is not a number, so using `isFinite` instead of `isNaN` would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
