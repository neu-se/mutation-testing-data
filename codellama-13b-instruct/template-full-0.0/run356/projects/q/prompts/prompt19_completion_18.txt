  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to capture the current line number, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
qStartingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the `qStartingLine` variable, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the `undefined` value, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
