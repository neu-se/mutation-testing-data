  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is being called on the `PolicyMap` instance, which would add the `policy` object to the map even if it already exists. In the original code, the `set` method is only called if the `policy` object is not already in the map, which ensures that there are no duplicates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is being called with an empty object as the third argument, which would overwrite any existing value in the map with the `policy` object. In the original code, the `set` method is only called if the `policy` object is not already in the map, which ensures that there are no duplicates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy, {});
