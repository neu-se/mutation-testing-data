  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would match a different part of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the matched string to uppercase, which would change the result of the `replace()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the string into an array of substrings, which would change the result of the `replace()` method.

DONE.
