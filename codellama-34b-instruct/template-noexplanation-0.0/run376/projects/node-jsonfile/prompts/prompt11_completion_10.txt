  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This change will cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as the input string is not a valid JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as the input string is not a valid JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This change will cause the `JSON.parse()` method to throw an error, as the input string is not a valid JSON string.

DONE.
