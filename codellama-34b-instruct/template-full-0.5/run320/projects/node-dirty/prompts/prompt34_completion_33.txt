  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment only calls the callback function when the data is persisted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not called at all, whereas the original code fragment calls the callback function when the data is persisted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not called at all, whereas the original code fragment calls the callback function when the data is persisted.

DONE.
