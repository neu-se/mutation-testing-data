  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(otherData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the first key in `otherData`, while the modified code fragment checks if they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(otherData).indexOf(embedType) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the first key in `otherData`, while the modified code fragment checks if the `embedType` is not found in `otherData`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherData[embedType] === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `embedType` is equal to the first key in `otherData`, while the modified code fragment checks if the `embedType` is not found in `otherData`.

DONE.
