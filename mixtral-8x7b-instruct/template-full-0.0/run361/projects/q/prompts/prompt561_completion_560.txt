 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('generator error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object instead of using the provided exception object, potentially causing a different error handling flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ value: exception, done: true }
