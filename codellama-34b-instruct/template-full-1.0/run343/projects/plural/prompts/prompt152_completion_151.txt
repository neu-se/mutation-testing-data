  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the pluralization function would be applied twice, which would result in a different output for words that have a plural form that is not simply the singular form plus an "s". For example, the word "foot" would be pluralized as "feets" instead of "feet".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the pluralization function would be applied to a different input value, which would result in a different output for words that have a plural form that is not simply the singular form plus an "s". For example, the word "tooth" would be pluralized as "tooths" instead of "teeth".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the pluralization function would not be applied at all, which would result in a different output for all
