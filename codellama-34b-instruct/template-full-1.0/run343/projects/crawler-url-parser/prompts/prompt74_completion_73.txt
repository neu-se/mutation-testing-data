  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', '<a href="https://www.example.com">')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the href attribute of the base element, which is used as a reference for relative URLs in the document.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').removeAttr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the href attribute of the base element, which means that relative URLs in the document will no longer be resolved relative to the original base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', '<a href="https://www.example.com">').attr('href2', '<a href="https://www.example2.com">')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional href attribute to the base element, which may cause issues in the code that uses the first href attribute.

DONE.
