  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the entire otherOp as an insert instead of the specific component of the op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the peekLength of the otherIter as an insert instead of the specific component of the op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the retain of the otherOp as an insert instead of the specific component of the op.

DONE.
