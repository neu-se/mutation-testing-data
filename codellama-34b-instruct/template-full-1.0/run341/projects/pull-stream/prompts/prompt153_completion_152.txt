  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function, and `onAbort` is a callback function that takes two arguments. When `abort` is called, it will execute the `onAbort` callback function with the `abort` function as the first argument and the `value` function as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a callback function that takes two arguments, and `abort` is a function. When `onAbort` is called with `abort` as the first argument, it will execute the `abort` function with the `value` function as the first argument and the `onAbort` callback function as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort && !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort`
