  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key + val);
```
This would result in different behavior because `key + val` will concat the key and value instead of updating the value for the corresponding key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `val + 1` will increment the value instead of just setting it to the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `val * 2` will double the value instead of just setting it to the given value.

DONE.
