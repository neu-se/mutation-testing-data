  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reduce(function (accum, promise) {
  return accum.then(function () {
    return promise;
  });
}, Q.resolve())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` method is not present in the replacement code, which means that the promise returned by `allResolved` would not be fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reduce(function (accum, promise) {
  return accum.then(function () {
    return promise;
  }).then(function (result) {
    throw result[0];
  });
}, Q.resolve())
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected with the result of the first rejected promise, rather than fulfilled with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reduce(function (accum, promise) {
  return
