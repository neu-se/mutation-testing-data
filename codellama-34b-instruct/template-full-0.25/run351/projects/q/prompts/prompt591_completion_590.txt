  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a new iterable containing all the elements of a given iterable, while `none` is not a valid JavaScript function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a new iterable containing all the elements of a given iterable, while `some` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a new iterable containing some of the elements of a given iterable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
every
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a new iterable containing all the elements of a given iterable, while `every` is a built-in JavaScript function that returns a new iterable containing all the elements of a given iterable that satisfy a given predicate.

DONE.
