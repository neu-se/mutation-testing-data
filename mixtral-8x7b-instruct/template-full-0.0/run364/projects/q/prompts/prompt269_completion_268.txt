 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would no longer reject the promise with the provided reason, but instead do nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be replaced with a boolean value, which would cause a type error when called with arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` function would be replaced with the `deferred.resolve` function, causing the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
