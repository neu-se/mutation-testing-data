 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `true` for pending promises, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `false` for rejected promises with a `null` reason, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any object with a `state` property to bypass the promise-like object check, potentially causing false positives in the `isRejected` function.

DONE.
