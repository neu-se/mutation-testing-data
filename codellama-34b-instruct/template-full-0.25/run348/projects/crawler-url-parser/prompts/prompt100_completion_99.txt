  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.href` is a different property than `currentUrl.url`, and it may not be a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol + "//" + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would construct a URL using the `protocol`, `host`, and `path` properties of the `currentUrl` object, which may not be the same as the original URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrl.href).href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the `href` property of the `currentUrl` object using the `URL.parse()` method, which may not produce the same result as the original code.

DONE.
