  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code only passes one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrlStr` is a string, but `parse` expects a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.href` is a string, but `parse` expects a URL object.

DONE.
