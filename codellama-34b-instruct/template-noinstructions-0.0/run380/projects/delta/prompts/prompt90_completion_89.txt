  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
          newOp.retain > lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `newOp.retain > lastOp.retain` would cause the code to only execute if the `newOp.retain` property is greater than the `lastOp.retain` property, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' &&
          newOp.retain < lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `newOp.retain < lastOp.retain` would cause the code to only execute if the `newOp.retain` property is less than the `lastOp.retain` property, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3
