  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `sinh` is an odd function, meaning that it changes sign when its argument is multiplied by -1, while `cosh` is an even function, meaning that it remains the same when its argument is multiplied by -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `tanh` is a hyperbolic function, meaning that it has a range of values that is larger than the range of values of `cosh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `coth` is the reci
