  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a timezone is not deprecated, while this new code fragment checks if a timezone is deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key] || tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a timezone is not deprecated, while this new code fragment checks if a timezone does not exist or if it is deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.some(tz => tz.name === key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a timezone has a specific key, while this new code fragment checks if any timezone in the list has a specific name.

DONE.
