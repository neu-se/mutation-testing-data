  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    throw new Error("something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.reject("something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the string "something went wrong", whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {
    return Q.resolve("something went wrong");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "something went wrong", whereas the original code would have resolved the promise with the value of `promise`.
