  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are different functions, and `resolve` would not result in the same behavior as `reject` in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects an error object as its argument, and passing `null` would result in a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would raise an exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the thrown value, rather than the value passed to `reject`.

DONE.
