  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using the default separator, which is a space character. In contrast, the new code fragment splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using an empty string as the separator, which would result in each character of the `src` string being treated as a separate substring.
