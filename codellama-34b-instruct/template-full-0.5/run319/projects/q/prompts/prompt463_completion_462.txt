  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if the rejection has already been reported, leading to duplicate notifications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if the rejection has already been handled, leading to incorrect notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if the rejection has already been handled, leading to incorrect notifications.

DONE.
