  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively. If `a` and `b` are equal, the function would return a scalar value instead of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 times the imaginary part to the real part, returning a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part from the real part, returning a different complex number.

DONE.
