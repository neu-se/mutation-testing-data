  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Dirty.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `Dirty.emit` is a different object than `this.emit`, and would likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Dirty._queue.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `Dirty._queue.emit` is a different object than `this.emit`, and would likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Dirty._writeStream.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `Dirty._writeStream.emit` is a different object than `this.emit`, and would likely cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
