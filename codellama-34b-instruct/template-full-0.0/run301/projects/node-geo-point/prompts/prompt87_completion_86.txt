  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of an angle in radians, while the replaced code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of an angle in radians. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of an angle in radians, while the replaced code fragment uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of an angle in radians. This would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ
