  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `type` function on the second element of the `rule` array, which is not the same as calling it on the `word` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the second element of the `rule` array, which is not the same as returning the type of the `word` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the constructor function of the second element of the `rule` array, which is not the same as returning the name of the constructor function of the `word` variable.

DONE.
