```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value or another promise, while `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. Replacing `reject` with `resolve` would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that handles the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, while `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. Replacing `reject` with `throw` would cause the code to throw an exception instead of rejecting the promise, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that handles the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that reject
