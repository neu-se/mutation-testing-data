  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with the new value, which would trigger a notification to any listeners that the promise has been resolved with a new value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with the original value, which would trigger a notification to any listeners that the promise has been resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called without any arguments, which would trigger a notification to any listeners that the promise has been resolved with no value.

DONE.
