  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random progressed"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the `progressed` function as a callback to the `when` function, which is expected to be called with the current progress value during the execution of the promise. However, replacing it with a random string may cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the `progressed` function as a callback to the `when` function, which is expected to be called with the current progress value during the execution of the promise. However, replacing it with null may cause the code to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressed` function immediately instead of passing it as a callback to the `when` function. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where
