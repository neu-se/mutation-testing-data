  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment always returns true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment always returns false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](this['re'] + this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code fragment checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is zero.

DONE.
