  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be extracting links with the text "b" instead of "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a' + 'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be extracting links with the text "ab" instead of "a".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a' + 'b' + 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be extracting links with the text "abc" instead of "a".

DONE.
