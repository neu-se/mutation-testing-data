  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include one more character than the original code, which could cause the slice to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude one character from the slice, which could cause the slice to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the slice one character later than the original code, which could cause the slice to return a different result.

DONE.
