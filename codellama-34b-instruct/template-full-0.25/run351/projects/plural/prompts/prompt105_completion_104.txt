  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with 's', while this new code fragment would also match words that end with 'ies'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with 's', while this new code fragment would also match words that end with 's' and append an additional 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep
