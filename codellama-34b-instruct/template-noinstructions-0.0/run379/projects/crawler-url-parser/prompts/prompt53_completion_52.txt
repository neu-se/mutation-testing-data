  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to be called with a null value as the first argument, which could lead to a null pointer exception or other error.

DONE.
