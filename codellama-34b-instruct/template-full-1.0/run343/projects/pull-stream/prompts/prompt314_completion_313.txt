  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` and `data` are not equivalent values. The `data` variable is a parameter that holds the input data, while `null` is a special value that represents the absence of data. Using `null` instead of `data` would change the behavior of the function and potentially lead to errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"data"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"data"` is a string literal and `data` is a variable that holds the input data. Using `"data"` instead of `data` would change the behavior of the function and potentially lead to errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value that indicates a variable was not assigned a value. Using `undefined` instead of `data` would change the behavior of the function and potentially lead to errors.

DONE.
