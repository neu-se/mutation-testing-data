  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `promise` is a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.race` is a function that returns a promise that resolves or rejects when all of the promises in an iterable have resolved or rejected, whereas `promise` is a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.passByCopy
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.passByCopy` is a function that takes an object and returns a copy of the object, whereas `promise` is a promise object.

DONE.
