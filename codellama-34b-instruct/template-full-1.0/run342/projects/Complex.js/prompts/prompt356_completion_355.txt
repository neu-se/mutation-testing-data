  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function to atan2, which is a different mathematical function that returns different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'* a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function to atan2, which is a different mathematical function that returns different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a^2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function to atan2, which is a different mathematical function that returns different results.

DONE.
