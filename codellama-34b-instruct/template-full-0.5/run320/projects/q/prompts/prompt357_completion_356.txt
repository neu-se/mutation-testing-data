  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject(exception.message)` would create a new rejected promise with a different reason than the original rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception.message` would throw an error with a different message than the original error.

DONE.
