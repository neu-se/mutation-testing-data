  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](this['im']));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is finite, while this new code fragment checks if the real part is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](this['re']));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the real part is finite, while this new code fragment checks if the imaginary part is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite'](this['im'] * this['re']));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is finite, while this new code fragment checks if the product of the imaginary and real parts is finite.

DONE.
