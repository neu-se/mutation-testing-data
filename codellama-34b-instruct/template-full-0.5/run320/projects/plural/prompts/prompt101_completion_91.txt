  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches a different letter than the original code fragment, which was `/e/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches a different letter than the original code fragment, which was `/e/`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/e/, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/e/` matches a different letter than the original code fragment, which was `/a/`.

DONE.
