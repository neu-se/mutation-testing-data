  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` function is now returning `undefined` instead of the expected distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` function is now returning 0 instead of the expected distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDistance` function is now returning `null` instead of the expected distance.

DONE.
