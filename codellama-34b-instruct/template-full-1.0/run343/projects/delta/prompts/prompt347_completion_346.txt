  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra element would be added to the array, leading to incorrect results when using the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an element would be removed from the array, leading to incorrect results when using the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because the wrong data is being used. Instead of using the base operation data, we are using the this operation data.

DONE.
