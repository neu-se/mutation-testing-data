  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with the first element removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a different array, with the first three elements removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return the entire array, without removing any elements.

DONE.
