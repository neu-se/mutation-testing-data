  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverCountry` function is not being called, which means that the country object will not be modified to include the `timezones` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(timezones[name], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function is not being called, which means that the timezone object will not be modified to include the `deprecated` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(countries[id], options);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverCountry` function is not being called, which means that the country object will not be modified to include the `timezones` property.

DONE.
