Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the URL to the host of the URL, which may not be unique and could lead to incorrect handling of links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the path of the URL instead of the full URL, which could result in multiple entries being treated as the same if they share the same path but have different domains.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + '?test=true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a query parameter to the URL, which would create a new unique entry in the map even if the original URL was the same, potentially leading to incorrect duplicate handling.

DONE.
