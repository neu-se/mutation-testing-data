  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because fs.accessSync will synchronously check the file permissions, while fs.promises.access asynchronously checks the file permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const fs = require('fs');
fs.access
```
This would result in different behavior because it will call the fs.access function, which is different from fs.promises.access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.access
```
This would result in different behavior because it will call the fs.access function, which is different from fs.promises.access.

DONE.
