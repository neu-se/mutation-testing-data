  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value for the input `x`, which would in turn affect the calculation of `cosm1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value for the input `x`, which would in turn affect the calculation of `cosm1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would return a different value for the input `x`, which would in turn affect the calculation of `cosm1`.

DONE.
