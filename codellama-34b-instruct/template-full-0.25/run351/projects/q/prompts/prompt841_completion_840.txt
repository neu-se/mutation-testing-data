  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is being replaced with `null`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` operator is being replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function is being called with `null` as the first argument, instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
