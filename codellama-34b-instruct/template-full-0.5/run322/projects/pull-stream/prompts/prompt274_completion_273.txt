  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is expected to return a function that can be called only once, but `true` is a boolean value that cannot be called at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is expected to return a function that can be called only once, but `false` is a boolean value that cannot be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is expected to return a function that can be called only once, but `null` is a null value that cannot be called at all.

DONE.
