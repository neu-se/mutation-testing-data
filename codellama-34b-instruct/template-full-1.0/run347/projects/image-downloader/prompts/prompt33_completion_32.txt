  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pause` method does not consume the response data, unlike the original `resume` method, which means that the memory used by the response data would not be freed up. This could cause issues with the performance of the application, especially if the response data is large.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would destroy the entire socket and not just the response data. This could cause unexpected behavior and potentially lead to errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.readable.pipe(createWriteStream(dest));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readable` pipe would not consume the response data, unlike the original `resume` method, which means that the memory used by the response data would not be freed up. This could cause issues with the performance of the application,
