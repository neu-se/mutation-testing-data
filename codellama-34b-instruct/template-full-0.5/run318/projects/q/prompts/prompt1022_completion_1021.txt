  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a different method than "post" and would cause a different set of actions to be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument "foo" is added to the method call, which could cause the method to behave differently if it expects a specific number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are passed in a different order, which could cause the method to behave differently if it relies on a specific argument order.

DONE.
