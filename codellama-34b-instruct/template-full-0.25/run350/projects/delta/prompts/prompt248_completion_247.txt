  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the this iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `peekLength` method on the this iterator instead of accessing the `peekLength` property, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would get the length of the peeked operation instead of the length of the iterator, which could cause the diff algorithm to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
