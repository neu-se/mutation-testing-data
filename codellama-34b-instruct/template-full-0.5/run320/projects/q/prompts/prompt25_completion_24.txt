  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = task;
```
This would result in different behavior because `head.task` is a function that is called later in the code, but by assigning `task` to it, we are overwriting the function and replacing it with the new value of `task`, which is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = function() { task(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because we are creating a new function that calls `task` and assigning it to `head.task`. This new function will be called later in the code, but it will not have the same behavior as the original `task` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because we are setting `head.task` to `null`, which means that the function will not be called later in the code.

DONE.
