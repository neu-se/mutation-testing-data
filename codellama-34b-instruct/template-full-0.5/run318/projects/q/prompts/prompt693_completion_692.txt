  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array-like object as its second argument, but `null` is not an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array-like object with a `length` property, but an empty array does not have a `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array-like object with a `length` property, but an empty object does not have a `length` property.

DONE.
