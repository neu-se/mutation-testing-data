  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator means "or," so if either `a` or `b` is 0, the statement would evaluate to `true`, whereas the original code fragment `a === 0 && b === 0` would only evaluate to `true` if both `a` and `b` are 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator means "not," so the statement would evaluate to `true` if `a` is falsy and `b` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment `a === 0 && b === 0` would only evaluate to `true` if both `a` and `b` are 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the statement would evaluate to
