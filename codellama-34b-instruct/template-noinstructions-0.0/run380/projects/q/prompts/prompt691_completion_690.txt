  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` value would be different in the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` array would be sliced differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be used instead of the `apply` method.

DONE.
