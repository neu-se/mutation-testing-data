  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `verb` string into an array of individual characters, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
