  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the reason is in the unhandledReasons array, not the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the unhandledRejections array is 0, not if the promise is in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the reportedUnhandledRejections array is 0, not if the promise is in the array.

DONE.
