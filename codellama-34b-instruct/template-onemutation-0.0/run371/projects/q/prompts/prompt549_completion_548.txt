  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is always `undefined` in the original code, while `result.done` is a boolean indicating whether the promise is settled or not. Using `result.value` would cause the code to always enter the `if` block, even if the promise is not settled, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
