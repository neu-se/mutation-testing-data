  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this modified code fragment checks if `val` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this modified code fragment checks if the type of `val` is `'undefined'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `val` is `undefined`, while this modified code fragment checks if `val` is falsy.

DONE.
