  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when both `this` and `z` are zero, whereas the original code would return `true` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when both `this` and `z` are infinite, whereas the original code would return `true` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when either `this` or `z` is infinite, whereas the original code would only return `true` when both are infinite.

DONE.
