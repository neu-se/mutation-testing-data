  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

DONE.
