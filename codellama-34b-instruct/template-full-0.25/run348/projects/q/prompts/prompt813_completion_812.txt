  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `value` only if the promise is fulfilled, but this new code fragment would return `value` regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `value` only if the promise is fulfilled, but this new code fragment would throw an error if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `value` only if the promise is fulfilled, but this new code fragment would return a rejected promise if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
