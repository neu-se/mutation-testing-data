  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first attribute of the last operation, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the number of attributes of the last operation, whereas the original code fragment considers the attributes themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all attributes of the last operation except the first one, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

DONE.
