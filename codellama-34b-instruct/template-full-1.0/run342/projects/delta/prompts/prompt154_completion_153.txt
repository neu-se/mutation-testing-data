  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to stop early, potentially neglecting some of the remaining operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to stop early, potentially neglecting some of the remaining operations in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to stop after only one iteration, potentially neglecting the rest of the operations in the other iterator.

DONE.
