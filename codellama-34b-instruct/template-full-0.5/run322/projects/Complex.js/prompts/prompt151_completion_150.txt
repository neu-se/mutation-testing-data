  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['re']` is `NaN`, but this replacement would check if it is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['re']` is `NaN`, but this replacement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['re']` is `NaN`, but this replacement would always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
