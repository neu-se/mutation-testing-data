  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).ncall
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of sending the function as a message to the object, it would call the function with the object as the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise(object).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of sending the function as a message to the object, it would call the function with the object as the context and return a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object).npost
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of sending the function as a message to the object, it would call the function with the object as the context and return a promise that resolves to the return value of the function.

DONE.
