  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.length
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `attributes` property is an empty object. This will result in the `insert` operation being performed even if the `attributes` property is empty, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.size
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `attributes` property is an empty object. This will result in the `insert` operation being performed even if the `attributes` property is empty, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.length === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if the `attributes` property is an empty object. This will result in the `insert` operation being performed only if the `attributes` property is empty
