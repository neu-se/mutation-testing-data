Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the current delta with itself instead of the other delta, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'placeholder_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a static string for comparison instead of the actual content of the other delta, which would always yield a non-matching result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the second string to uppercase before comparison, potentially causing mismatches if the original string contained lowercase letters.

DONE.
