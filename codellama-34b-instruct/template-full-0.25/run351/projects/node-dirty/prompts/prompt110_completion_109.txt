  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the stream has received an `end` event from the underlying resource, indicating that there will be no more data to read. In contrast, the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs while reading from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the stream has been closed, either by the user or by the underlying resource. In contrast, the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs while reading from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'readable'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readable` event is emitted when there is data available to be read from the stream. In contrast, the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs while reading from the stream.

DONE.
