  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolvedPromise.inspect` returns a promise inspect object with a `state` property, but the new code fragment `resolvedPromise.inspect().state` returns the `state` property of the promise inspect object directly, which could be a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `resolvedPromise.inspect
