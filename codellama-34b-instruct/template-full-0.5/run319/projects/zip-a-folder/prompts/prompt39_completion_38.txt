  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `src` variable directly, while this modified code fragment uses the `src` variable as a string and splits it into an array of glob patterns. This would cause the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called with different arguments, which could potentially result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.directory(globPart, false);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `src` variable directly, while this modified code fragment uses the `src` variable as a string and splits it into an array of glob patterns. This would cause the `zipArchive.directory()` method to be called with different arguments, which could potentially result in different behavior.
