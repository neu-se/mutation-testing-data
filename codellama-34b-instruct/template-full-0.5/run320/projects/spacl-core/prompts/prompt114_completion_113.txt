  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to the first element of the `verbs` array, regardless of the value of the `verbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[verbs.length - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `verb` variable to the last element of the `verbs` array, regardless of the value of the `verbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `verbs` array and assign it to the `verb` variable, regardless of the value of the `verbs` array.

DONE.
