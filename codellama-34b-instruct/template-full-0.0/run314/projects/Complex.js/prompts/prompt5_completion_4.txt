  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, and the code relies on the specific output values of `Math.exp` to compute the correct result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, and the code relies on the specific output values of `Math.exp` to compute the correct result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and output values, and the code relies on the specific output values of `Math.exp` to compute the correct result.

DONE.
