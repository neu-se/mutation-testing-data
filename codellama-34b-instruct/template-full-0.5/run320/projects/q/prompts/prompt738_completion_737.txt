  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise, whereas `Q.resolve` would fulfill it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, whereas `Q.resolve` would fulfill the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` would resolve all promises in an array, whereas `Q.resolve` would fulfill a single promise.

DONE.
