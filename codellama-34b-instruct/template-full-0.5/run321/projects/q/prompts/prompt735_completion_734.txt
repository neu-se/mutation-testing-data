  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different function from `all`, and it returns a promise that is fulfilled when any of the promises in the input array is fulfilled, rather than when all of them are fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different function from `all`, and it returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in the input array have settled, regardless of whether they were fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.race` is a different function from `all`, and it returns a promise that is fulfilled as soon as any of the promises in the input array is fulfilled, rather than waiting for all of them to be fulfilled.

DONE.
