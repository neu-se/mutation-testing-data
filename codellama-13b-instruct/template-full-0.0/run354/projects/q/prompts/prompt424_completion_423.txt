  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isFulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the value is a fulfilled promise, while the new code fragment checks whether the value is a fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isRejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the value is a rejected promise, while the new code fragment checks whether the value is a rejected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.isPending(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the value is a pending promise, while the new code fragment checks whether the value is a pending value.

DONE.
