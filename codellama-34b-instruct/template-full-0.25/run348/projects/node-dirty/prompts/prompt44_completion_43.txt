  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is a different method than `set`, and it has a different signature.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method than `set`, and it has a different signature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a different method than `set`, and it has a different signature.

DONE.
