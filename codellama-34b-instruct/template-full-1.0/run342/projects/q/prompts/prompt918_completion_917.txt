  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `.resolve` method call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `promise.then()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `.reject` method call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `promise.then()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra `.notify` method call, which would result in a different value being passed to the `promise.then()` method.

DONE.
