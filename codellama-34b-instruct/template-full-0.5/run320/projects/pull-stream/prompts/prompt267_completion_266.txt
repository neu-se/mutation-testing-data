  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of `end`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`. This would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator that returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy, and `true` is always truthy. This means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `end`, and the function would return `true` instead of the expected stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator that returns the first operand if it is truthy, and `false` is always f
