  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to combine the `accum` and `curr.retain` values, while the new code fragment uses the `+=` operator to modify the `accum` value in place. The `+=` operator can have different behavior than `+` when the `accum` value is an object or array, as it can modify the original object or array instead of creating a new one.
