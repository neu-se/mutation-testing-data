  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the pattern in a case-insensitive manner, so it would also match `INDEX.html` and `index.HTML`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the pattern in multiple lines, so it would also match `index.html` and `index.HTML` if
