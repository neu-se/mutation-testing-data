  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first attribute of the `nextOp` object, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second attribute of the `nextOp` object, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.attributes[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third attribute of the `nextOp` object, whereas the original code fragment considers all attributes.

DONE.
