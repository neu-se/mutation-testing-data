  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of two or more numbers, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5 - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 5 from the index, whereas the original code fragment simply returned the `index`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the index, whereas the original code fragment simply returned the `index`.

DONE.
