  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument is not being used as an object, but rather as a number, which would cause the `get` and `set` methods to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument is not being used as an object, but rather as a number, which would cause the `get` and `set` methods to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` argument is not being used as an object, but rather as an array, which would cause the `get` and `set` methods to behave differently.

DONE.
