  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects the arguments to be in the order of `y` and `x`, whereas the original code fragment has them in the order of `x` and `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects the arguments to be in the order of `y` and `x`, whereas the original code fragment has them in the order of `x` and `y`.

DONE.
