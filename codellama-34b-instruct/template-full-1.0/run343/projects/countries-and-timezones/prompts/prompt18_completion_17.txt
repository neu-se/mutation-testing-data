  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(tz.a || id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a different value to the `all` array, which could potentially cause issues if the code that consumes this map is not expecting a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push `undefined` to the `all` array, which could potentially cause issues if the code that consumes this map is not expecting `undefined` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(id + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a different value to the `all` array, which could potentially cause issues if the code that consumes this map is not expecting a different value.

DONE.
