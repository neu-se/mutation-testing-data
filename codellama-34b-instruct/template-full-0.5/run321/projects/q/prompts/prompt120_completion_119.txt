  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not the same as the `hasOwnProperty` method, and it may return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `propertyIsEnumerable` method is not the same as the `hasOwnProperty` method, and it may return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is not the same as the `hasOwnProperty` method, and it may return a different value.

DONE.
