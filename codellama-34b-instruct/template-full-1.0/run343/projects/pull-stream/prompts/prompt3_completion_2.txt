  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the items in the `throughs` object instead of the `sources` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sinks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the items in the `sinks` object instead of the `sources` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in exports
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the items in the `exports` object instead of the `sources` object.

DONE.
