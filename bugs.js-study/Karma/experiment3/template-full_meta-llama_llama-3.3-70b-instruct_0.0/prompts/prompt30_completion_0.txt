Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file &&!file.sourceMap && line
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of a source map instead of its presence, which would lead to incorrect handling of files with source maps.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && file.sourceMap &&!line
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of a line number instead of its presence, which would lead to incorrect handling of files with line numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && file.sourceMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the line number check, which could lead to incorrect handling of files without line numbers, potentially causing errors or incorrect mappings.

DONE.
