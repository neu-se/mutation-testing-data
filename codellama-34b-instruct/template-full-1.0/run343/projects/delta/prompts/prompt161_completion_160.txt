  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next('abc')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to attempt to use the string 'abc' as an iterator, leading to a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to attempt to use the current value of the 'op' variable as an iterator, leading to a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to attempt to move backward through the iterator, when in fact it is already at the beginning of the iterator.

DONE.
