  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `null` is a falsy value that would be rejected by the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `undefined` is a falsy value that would be rejected by the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but the string "error" would be rejected by the promise.

DONE.
