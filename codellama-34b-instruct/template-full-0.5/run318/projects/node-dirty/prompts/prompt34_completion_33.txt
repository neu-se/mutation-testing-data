  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would not be passed as a callback function to the `emit` method, which could cause the event listener to not be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `() => {}` function would not have the same effect as the `cb` function, which could cause the event listener to not be invoked correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would not be passed as a callback function to the `emit` method, which could cause the event listener to not be invoked.

DONE.
