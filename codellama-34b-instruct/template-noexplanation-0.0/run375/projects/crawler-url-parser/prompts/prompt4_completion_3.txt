  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a negation operator added to the `_has_illegal_chars` function call. This would cause the function to return `true` if the `currentUrlStr` does not have any illegal characters, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with the `currentUrlStr` variable replaced with `baseUrlStr`. This would cause the function to check if the `baseUrlStr` has any illegal characters, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr.replace(/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\
