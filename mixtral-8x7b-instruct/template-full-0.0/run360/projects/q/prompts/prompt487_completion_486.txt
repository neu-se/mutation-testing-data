 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejection` is set to `false`, disabling unhandled rejection tracking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'use strict';
```
This would result in different behavior because using strict mode can change how JavaScript handles errors and variable declarations, potentially affecting the behavior of the unhandled rejection tracking code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete Q.resetUnhandledRejections;
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `resetUnhandledRejections` function from the `Q` object, making it impossible to reset the unhandled rejection tracking state.

DONE.
