  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `point` object to have a `type` property with the value `'Point'`, but by setting it to `'LineString'`, the method will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [10, 20]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `point` object to have a `coordinates` property with an array of two elements, but by setting it to `[10, 20]`, the method will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0] = 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the first element of the `coordinates` array to be a number, but by setting it to `10`, the
