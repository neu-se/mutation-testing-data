  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation. Using `peekLength` instead of `peekType` would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().type
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` only returns the type of the next operation. Using `next().type` instead of `peekType` would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().type
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` only returns the type of the next operation. Using
