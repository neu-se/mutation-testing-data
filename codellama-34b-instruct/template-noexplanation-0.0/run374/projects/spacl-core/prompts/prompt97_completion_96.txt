  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as `this.set` will always return `undefined`, which is not equal to `policy`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `false`, as `this.has` will always return `false`, which is not equal to `policy`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.delete
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `null`, as `this.delete` will always return `undefined`, which is not equal to `policy`.

DONE.
