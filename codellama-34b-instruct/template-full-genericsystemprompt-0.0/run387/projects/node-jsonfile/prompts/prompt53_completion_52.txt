  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is called with the key and value of each property in the object, and returns the value to be stringified. By replacing it with `null`, the replacer function will not be called, and the object will be stringified with its default behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = (key, value) => value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `replacer` is a function that is called with the key and value of each property in the object, and returns the value to be stringified. By replacing it with a function that always returns the value, the replacer function will be called for each property, but the value returned will always be the same as the original value, resulting in a different stringified object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = (key, value) =>
