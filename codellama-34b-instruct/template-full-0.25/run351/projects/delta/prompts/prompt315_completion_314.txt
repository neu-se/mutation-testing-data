  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the operation, while `0` is a constant value that would always return 0, regardless of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the operation, while `-1` is a constant value that would always return -1, regardless of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Op.length` method returns the length of the operation, while `null` is a null value that would always return null, regardless of the operation.

DONE.
