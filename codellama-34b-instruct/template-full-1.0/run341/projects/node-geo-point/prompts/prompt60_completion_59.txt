  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin( point1Rad + point2Rad )
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the latitude values of both points, which is not a meaningful calculation for finding the distance between them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos( point1Rad - point2Rad )
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the latitude values of both points, which is not a meaningful calculation for finding the distance between them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan( point1Rad )
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the calculation of the distance with the ratio of the distance to the radius of the Earth, which is not a meaningful calculation for finding the distance between points.

DONE.
