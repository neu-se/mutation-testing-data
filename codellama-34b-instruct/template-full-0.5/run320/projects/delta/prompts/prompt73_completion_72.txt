  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to be called twice, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the method has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly mutate the `ops` array, which could cause issues if the array is being used by other parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new op at a specific index in the `ops` array, which could cause issues if the array is being used by other parts of the code.

DONE.
