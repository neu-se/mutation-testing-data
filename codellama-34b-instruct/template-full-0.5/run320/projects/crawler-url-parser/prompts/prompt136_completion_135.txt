  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is looking for the string "default" instead of "index".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now global, meaning it will search for all occurrences of the pattern instead of just the first one.

DONE.
