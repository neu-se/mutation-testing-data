  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the `key` argument to the `delete` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, ""]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the `key` argument followed by an empty string to the `delete` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with the `key` argument followed by `undefined` to the `delete` method, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
