  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises, void
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is a value with a type of `undefined` and `undefined` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `Q.reject(promises)` return a rejected promise and triggers the `onRejected` handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).then(void 0, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `Q(promises).then(void 0, onRejected)` return a rejected promise and triggers the `onRejected` handler.

DONE.
