  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected(new Error("Different error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be in a different state of progress.

DONE.
