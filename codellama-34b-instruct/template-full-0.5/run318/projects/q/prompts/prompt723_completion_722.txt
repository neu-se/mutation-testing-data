  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect()` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` would always be "fulfilled" or "rejected", so the condition would never be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.value` would be undefined, so the condition would never be true.

DONE.
