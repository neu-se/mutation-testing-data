  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operator is used to remove properties from objects, rather than the `exit` method, which is used to exit a domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.simple
```
This would result in different behavior because the `simple` method is not a built-in method of the `Domain` class in Node.js, and would likely result in a "simple is not defined" error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.complex
```
This would result in different behavior because the `complex` method is not a built-in method of the `Domain` class in Node.js, and would likely result in a "complex is not defined" error.

DONE.
