  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the second element, rather than the first element, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the third element, rather than the first element, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the first element, but only include the first element in the resulting array, rather than including all elements starting from the first element, which is what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
