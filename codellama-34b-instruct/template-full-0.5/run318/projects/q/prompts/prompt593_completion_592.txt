  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise, and `apply` is a method that applies a function to a given `this` context and arguments. In this case, it would apply the `callback` function to `result` as `this` and the `args` array as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that applies a function to a given `this` context and arguments. In this case, it would apply the `callback` function to `callback` as `this` and the `args` array as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a given value. In this case, it would resolve `result` with the value returned by `callback.apply(result, args)`.

DONE.
