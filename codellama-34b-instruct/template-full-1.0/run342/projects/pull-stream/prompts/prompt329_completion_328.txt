  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `op` is not `null` or `undefined`, regardless of its value. In the original code, `op` is only used if it is truthy, so replacing it with `op && op` would cause the function to behave differently in cases where `op` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `op` function, potentially causing the function to behave differently in cases where `op` returns a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `null` instead of the original result of the `op` function.

DONE.
