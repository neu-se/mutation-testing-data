  Here are three different placeholders for the PLACEHOLDER with different behavior and brief explanations:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
spec.matchRaw
```
The `matchRaw` method is similar to `match`, but it returns the original string, not the resulting regex array. By using `matchRaw`, the test will expect the original string to be matched, not the resulting regex array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
!spec.match
```
This flips the result of the `match` method by using the `!` operator. If the `match` method returns `true`, the `matchRaw` method will return `false`, and vice versa. This change can result in a different behavior during testing, as the test case will expect the `match` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
spec.replace('/', '')
```
This replaces all slashes (`/`) in the `spec` string with an empty string. This change can result in
