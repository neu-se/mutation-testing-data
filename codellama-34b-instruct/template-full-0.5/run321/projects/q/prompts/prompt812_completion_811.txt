  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw the `reason` error immediately, rather than returning a promise that is rejected with that error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `reason` error immediately, rather than returning a promise that is rejected with that error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the `reason` error, rather than returning a promise that is rejected with that error.

DONE.
