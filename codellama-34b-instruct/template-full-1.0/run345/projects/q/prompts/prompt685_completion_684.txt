  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects two arguments, but only one is being provided. The code would fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["a", "b", "c"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects two arguments, but a string is being passed as the first argument. The code would fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a string or a number as the first argument, but an object is being passed. The code would fail with a `TypeError`.

DONE.
