  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op + 1` would result in a concatenation of `op` and the string "1", rather than the addition of `op` and the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op * 2` would result in a concatenation of `op` and the string "2", rather than the multiplication of `op` and the number 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a string, and `op - 1` would result in a concatenation of `op` and the string "-1", rather than the subtraction of `op` and the number 1.

DONE.
