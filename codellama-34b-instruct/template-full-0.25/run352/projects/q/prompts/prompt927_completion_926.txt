  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `call` is a function that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(arguments, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a function that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a function that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

DONE.
