  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with three arguments, whereas the original code only calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with four arguments, whereas the original code only calls it with three arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index, this, basis)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with five arguments, whereas the original code only calls it with four arguments.

DONE.
