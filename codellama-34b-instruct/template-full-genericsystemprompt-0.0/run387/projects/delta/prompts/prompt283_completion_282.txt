  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in a string or array, while `indexOf` is a method that returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether a specified value is present in a string, while `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns an array of matches between a string and a regular expression, while `indexOf` returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value.

DONE.
