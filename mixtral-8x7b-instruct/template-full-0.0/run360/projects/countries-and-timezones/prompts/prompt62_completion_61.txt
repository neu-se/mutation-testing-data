 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'id'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `buildCountry` from the `id` variable to a string literal. This could cause issues if the `buildCountry` function expects a variable as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `buildCountry` from the `id` variable to an integer. This could cause issues if the `buildCountry` function expects a string as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to `buildCountry` from the `id` variable to a random number. This could cause issues in the `buildCountry` function if it relies on a consistent identifier to build the country object.

DONE.
