  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even when the `string.length > 1` condition is met.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length <= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even when the `string.endsWith('/')` condition is not met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.split('/').length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even when the `string.endsWith('/')` condition is not met.

DONE.
