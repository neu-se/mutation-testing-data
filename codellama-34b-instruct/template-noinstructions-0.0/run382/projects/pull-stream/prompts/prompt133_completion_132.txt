  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause the test suite to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle errors, while this new code fragment does. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the function is not handling errors correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'hello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not return any value, while this new code fragment returns the string 'hello'. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the function is not returning the correct value.

DONE.
