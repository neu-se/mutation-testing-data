  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise inspect object, which has a `state` property that can be either "fulfilled", "rejected", or "pending". By checking if the `state` property is "rejected", we are checking if the promise has been rejected, which is different from the original code that checks if the object is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().value === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a promise inspect object, which has a `value` property that contains the fulfillment value of the promise. By checking if the `value` property is "rejected", we are checking if the promise has been fulfilled with the value "rejected", which is different from the original code that checks if the object is a promise.
