  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid value for the `progressed` parameter of the `then` method. The `then` method expects a function as the third argument, but `null` is not a function and will cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid value for the `progressed` parameter of the `then` method. The `then` method expects a function as the third argument, but `undefined` is not a function and will cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, but it is not a valid value for the `progressed` parameter of the `then` method. The `then` method
