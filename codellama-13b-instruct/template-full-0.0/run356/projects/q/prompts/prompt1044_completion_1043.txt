  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called with the string "tail" instead of the default value, which would cause the `get` method to return the tail of the queue instead of the head.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called with the string "head" instead of the default value, which would cause the `get` method to return the head of the queue instead of the tail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the `get` method to return the head of the queue instead of the tail.

DONE.
