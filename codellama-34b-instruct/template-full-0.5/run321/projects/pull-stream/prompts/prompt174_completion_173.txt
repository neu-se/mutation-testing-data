  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the length of the array plus one, which would cause the loop to run one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the length of the array minus one, which would cause the loop to run one less time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the first element of the array instead of the length, which could cause the loop to exit early or not at all.

DONE.
