  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses multiplication, while the replacement code fragment uses addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + c * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses only two variables, while the replacement code fragment uses three variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + c * d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses only two variables, while the replacement code fragment uses four variables.

DONE.
