  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not strictly equal to the string `'string'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== null && mapper !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not strictly equal to `null` and not strictly equal to `undefined`.

DONE.
