  Sure, I can provide three options for the PLACEHOLDER in the code.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test will now fail if there are 0 or 1 arguments, whereas the original code would have succeeded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length >= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test will now fail if there is only 1 argument, whereas the original code would have succeeded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test will now succeed if there are 0 or 1 arguments, whereas the original code would have failed.

DONE.
