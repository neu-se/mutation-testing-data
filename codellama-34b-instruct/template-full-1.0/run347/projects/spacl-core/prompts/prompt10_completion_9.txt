  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment included a check for the version number, which is now missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of wildcards, while this code fragment checks for the presence of properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of parts, while this code fragment checks for the presence of parts.

DONE.
