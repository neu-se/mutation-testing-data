  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the specified number of characters from the delta, rather than inserting the contents of the other op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified number of characters from the delta, rather than inserting the contents of the other op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(new Op('retain', length))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new op onto the delta that retains the specified number of characters, rather than inserting the contents of the other op.

DONE.
