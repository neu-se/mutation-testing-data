  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to 1, regardless of the previous value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the value, regardless of the previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to null, regardless of the previous value.

DONE.
