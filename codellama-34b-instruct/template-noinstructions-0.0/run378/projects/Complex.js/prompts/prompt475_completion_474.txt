  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` function to always return `true`, regardless of the actual value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` function to always return `false`, regardless of the actual value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInfinite` function to always return `true`, regardless of the actual value of the complex number.

DONE.
