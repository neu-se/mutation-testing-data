  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because no matter the outcome of the `when` function, the `deferred.resolve` function would still be called, which would cause the `all` function to return a promise that is already resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be initialized with a negative value, which would cause the `when` function to be called with a negative number of arguments, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be initialized with a value that is larger than the number of promises in the `promises` array, which would cause the `when` function to be called with an excessive number of arguments, which would result in an error.

DONE.
