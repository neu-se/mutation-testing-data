  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array, while `size` is a property that returns the size of a data structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an array of the keys in the data structure, and `length` returns the number of elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an array of the values in the data structure, and `length` returns the number of elements in an array.

DONE.
