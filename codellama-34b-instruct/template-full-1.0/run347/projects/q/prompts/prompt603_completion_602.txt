  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const deferred = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const deferred = new Promise(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would create a new promise that never resolves instead of calling `defer`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const deferred = defer().reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would create a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

DONE.
