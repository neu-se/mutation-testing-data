  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the if statement would be executed, resulting in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the equality operator would be applied to a null value, which would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the equality operator would be applied to a string value, which would always be false.

DONE.
