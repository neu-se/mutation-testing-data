 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if the value is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw a TypeError, as isNaN expects a number as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check if the real part of the complex number is NaN, which is not the same as checking if the whole complex number is NaN.

DONE.
