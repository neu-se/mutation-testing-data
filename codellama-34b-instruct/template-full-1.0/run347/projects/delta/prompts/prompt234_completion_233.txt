  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const str = "Hello, world!"
new Delta({ ops: [ { insert: str } ] });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Delta object with the string "Hello, world!" as the inserted text, whereas the original code created a new Delta object with the result of the `otherIter.next(opLength)` call as the inserted text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const len = otherIter.peekLength();
new Delta({ ops: [ { insert: otherIter.next(len) } ] });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Delta object with the result of the `otherIter.next(len)` call as the inserted text, whereas the original code created a new Delta object with the result of the `otherIter.next(opLength)` call as the inserted text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const ops = otherIter.
