  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1["latitude"]
```
This would result in different behavior because "latitude" is now a string and the code will look for a property named "latitude" on the point1 object, which doesn't exist. If the property wasn't found, the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be using the "longitude" property instead of "latitude".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now be using the "latitude" property of the point2 object instead of point1.

DONE.
