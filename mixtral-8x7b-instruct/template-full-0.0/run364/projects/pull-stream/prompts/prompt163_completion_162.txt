 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the array is empty, instead of checking if it is not defined or null. This means that if an empty array is passed to the function, it will not execute the early return and will instead proceed to iterate over the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the array variable is undefined, instead of checking if it is not defined or null. This means that if the array variable is not defined (as opposed to being null or an empty array), it will execute the early return and return the abort function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new condition checks if the array is explicitly set to null, instead of checking if it is not defined or null. This means that if the array is explicitly set to
