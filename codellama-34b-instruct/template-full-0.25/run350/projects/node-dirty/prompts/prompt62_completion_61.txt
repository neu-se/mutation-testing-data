  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate an error occurring while reading from the file stream, which would cause the `error` event to be emitted instead of the `end` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate the write stream being closed before all data has been written, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted instead of the `end` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, () => {
  if (--this._inFlightWrites <= 0) this.emit('drain');
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simulate the write stream being closed before all data has been written, which would cause the `drain` event to
