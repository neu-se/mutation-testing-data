  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(this['re'], this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the maximum between the real and imaginary parts, while the original code calculates the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the real and imaginary parts, while the original code calculates the absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*this['re'] + 2*this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate twice the sum of the real and imaginary parts, while the original code calculates the absolute value.

DONE.
