  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 return new Complex(-res['re'], res['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asinh` function would be returning the wrong value, causing the `sech` and `csch` functions to also return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 return new Complex(res['re'], -res['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asinh` function would be returning the wrong value, causing the `coth` and `acoth` functions to also return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 return new Complex(-res['re'], -res['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asinh` function would be returning the wrong value, causing all the other functions that rely on it to also return incorrect values.

DONE.
