  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two characters of the word instead of the last one, which could cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last three characters of the word instead of the last one, which could cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 4
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last four characters of the word instead of the last one, which could cause the plural form of the word to be incorrect.

DONE.
