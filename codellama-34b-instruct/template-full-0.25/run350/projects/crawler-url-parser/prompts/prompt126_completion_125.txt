  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` argument to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `pageurl` argument to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `currentUrl` argument to the `parse` function, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
