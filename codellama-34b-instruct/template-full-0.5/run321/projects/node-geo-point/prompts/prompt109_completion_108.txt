  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` has a higher precedence than the `^` operator, which means that `2 * zoom` would be evaluated first, resulting in a different value than `2 ^ zoom`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ^ (zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would increase the value of `zoom` by one, resulting in a different value than `2 ^ zoom`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ^ (zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would decrease the value of `zoom` by one, resulting in a different value than `2 ^ zoom`.

DONE.
