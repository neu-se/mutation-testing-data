  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the full URL string, including the protocol and hostname, instead of just the pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname + parsedUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the query string in the URL, which may not be desirable in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname.replace(/^\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the leading slash from the pathname, which may not be desirable in some cases.

DONE.
