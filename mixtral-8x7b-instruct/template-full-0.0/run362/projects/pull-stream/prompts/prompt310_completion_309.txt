 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would now check for the negation of the test, potentially allowing items that should have failed the test to pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly set the `this` value to `null` when calling the `test` function, potentially causing issues if `test` relies on the correct `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now require the `test` function to explicitly return `false` for an item to be considered a failure, rather than just a falsy value.

DONE.
