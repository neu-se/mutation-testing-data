  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a special case for the word "chilli," and the new code fragment does not handle this special case correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "es" suffix to the word "chilli," while the new code fragment adds an "is" suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli', 'chillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an "es" suffix to the word "chilli," while the new code fragment adds an "ies" suffix.

DONE.
