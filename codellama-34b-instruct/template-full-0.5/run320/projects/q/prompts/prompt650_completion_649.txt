  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, which would cause the `post` method to be called with no arguments, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array that starts at the second argument, which would cause the `post` method to be called with one fewer argument than expected, which would likely result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array that starts at the third argument,
