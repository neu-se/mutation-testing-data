 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function context, which could affect access to outer variables or this keyword.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes true as the second argument to the callback, which might not be the expected behavior for the consumers of this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it exposes the internal state of the function by passing the `_read` variable as the second argument to the callback, which might not be the expected behavior for the consumers of this function.

DONE.
