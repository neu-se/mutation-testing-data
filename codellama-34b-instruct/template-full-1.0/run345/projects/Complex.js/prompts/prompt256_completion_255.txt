  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would calculate the cosine of the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would calculate the square root of the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would calculate the absolute value of the imaginary part of the complex number, instead of the sine.

DONE.
