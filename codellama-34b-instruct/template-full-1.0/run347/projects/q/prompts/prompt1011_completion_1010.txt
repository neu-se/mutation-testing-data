  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `defer` is a function that creates a deferred promise, but when it is replaced with `undefined`, an error would be thrown when `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` is invoked, as `deferred` would be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `defer` is a function that creates a deferred promise, but when it is replaced with `null`, an error would be thrown when `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` is invoked, as `deferred` would be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `defer` is a function that creates a deferred promise, but when it is replaced with `deferred.resolve`, which is
