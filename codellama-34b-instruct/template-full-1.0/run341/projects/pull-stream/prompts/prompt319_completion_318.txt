  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `end` argument in the callback function, and the callback function expects a truthy value for `end` to indicate that the stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not a valid value for the `end` argument in the callback function, and the callback function expects a truthy value for `end` to indicate that the stream has ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid value for the `end` argument in the callback function, and the callback function expects a truthy value for `end` to indicate that the stream has ended.

DONE.
