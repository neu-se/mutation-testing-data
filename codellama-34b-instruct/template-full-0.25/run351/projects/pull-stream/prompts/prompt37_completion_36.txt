  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is now 4 instead of 3, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is now 0 instead of 3, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is now 2 instead of 3, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
