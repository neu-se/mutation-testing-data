  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the key being accessed in the map, potentially causing the `get` method to return a value that is different from the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value being set in the map, potentially causing the `set` method to store a different value than the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key * 2) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the key being accessed in the map, potentially causing the `get` method to return a value that is different from the expected behavior.

DONE.
