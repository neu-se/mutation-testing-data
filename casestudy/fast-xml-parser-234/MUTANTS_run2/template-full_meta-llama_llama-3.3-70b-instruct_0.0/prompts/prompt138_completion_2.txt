Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement of trailing zeros in the decimal part of a number would be followed by a "0" instead of an empty string, potentially leading to incorrect numerical values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement of trailing zeros in the decimal part of a number would retain the original value, potentially leading to different rounding behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
".0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement of trailing zeros in the decimal part of a number would be followed by a ".0" instead of an empty string, potentially leading to incorrect numerical values or strings.

DONE.
