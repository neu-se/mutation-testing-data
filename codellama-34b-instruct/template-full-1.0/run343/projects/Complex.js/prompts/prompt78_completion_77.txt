  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be satisfied even if `i` was equal to `tokens.length`, which would result in an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < tokens.length; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment would be stepped up by 2 instead of 1, resulting in missed or duplicated iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < tokens.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment would be reversed, resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
