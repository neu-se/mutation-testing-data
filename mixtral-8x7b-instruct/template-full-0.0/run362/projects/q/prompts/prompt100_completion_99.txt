 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index in this` condition would always be falsy, and the `basis` would never be updated in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.hasOwnProperty(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for own properties only, ignoring inherited ones. This might not iterate over all array elements if some are inherited.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for the existence of the property but only verify if the index is less than the array's length. This might lead to iterating over non-existing properties or missing existing ones if the array has holes (unused indices).

DONE.
