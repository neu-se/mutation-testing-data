  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` returns a new array without modifying the original, whereas the original code fragment `ref` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.unshift(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the array.

DONE.
