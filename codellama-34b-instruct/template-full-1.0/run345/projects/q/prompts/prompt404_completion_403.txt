  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a promise, and will not have the `thenResolve` method called on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"hello"` does not have a `thenResolve` method, and will not be treated as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new resolved promise with no value, which will not have the same behavior as the original promise.

DONE.
