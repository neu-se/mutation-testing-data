  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `deprecated` property is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`. This could cause the `deliverCountry` function to return a different value for the `timezones` property, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `getTimezonesForCountry` function.

DONE.
