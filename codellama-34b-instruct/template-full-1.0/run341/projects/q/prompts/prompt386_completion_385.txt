  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcannel
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcannel` is not a valid method of a promise, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function with a null context, and then call it. This would cause the `callback` function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.factor()
```
This would result in different behavior because `factor` is not a valid method of a promise, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
