  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that returns a promise, but it is not being called in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that returns a promise, but it is not being called with the correct argument in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that returns a promise, but it is not being called with the correct arguments in the original code fragment.

DONE.
