  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled, which would trigger the promise's error handling instead of the success handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (){throw new Error('error')}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error in the fulfilled callback, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of undefined, which would trigger the promise's success handling instead of the error handling.

DONE.
