  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` return arrays of either keys or values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.foreach
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.foreach` is a function that takes a function and applies it to each element in the object, whereas `Object.keys` and `Object.values` simply return the keys or values of the object.

DONE.
