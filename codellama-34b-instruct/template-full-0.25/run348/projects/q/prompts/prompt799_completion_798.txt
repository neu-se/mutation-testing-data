  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may have a specific value or reference that is important for the functioning of the code. Replacing it with `null` could cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may have a specific value or reference that is important for the functioning of the code. Replacing it with `undefined` could cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `object` variable, which may have a specific value or reference that is important for the functioning of the code. Replacing it with an empty object `{}` could cause the code to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
