  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `test`, possibly causing the filter function to return the opposite of what was expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `test` would be incremented by 1, which would affect the result of the filter function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `test` would be multiplied by 2, which would affect the result of the filter function.

DONE.
