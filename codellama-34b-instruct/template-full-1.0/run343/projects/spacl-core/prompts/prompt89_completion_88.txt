  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the policy object with its name string, which could cause the query function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the policy object with null, which could cause the query function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.query(path, verb, ctx)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the policy object with the result of its query function, which could cause the query function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
