  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a less-than-or-equal-to comparison, while the new code fragment uses a less-than comparison. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a different set of values, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
