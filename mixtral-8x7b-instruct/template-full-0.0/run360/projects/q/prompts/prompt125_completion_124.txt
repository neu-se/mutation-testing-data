 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, instead of checking if the property is the object's own property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property is an array, instead of checking if the property is the object's own property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `call` method with a hardcoded `this` value of `null`, instead of dynamically determining the `this` value based on the object being checked.

DONE.
