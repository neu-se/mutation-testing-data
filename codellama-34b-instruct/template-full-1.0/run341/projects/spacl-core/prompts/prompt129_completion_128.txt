  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be incremented by 10 instead of 1, potentially causing the code to skip over important data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index -= 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be decremented by 10 instead of 1, potentially causing the code to access data that was not intended to be accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = index + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be set to 10 instead of being incremented by 1, potentially breaking the logic of the program.

DONE.
