  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `!thisOp.retain` will always be truthy, even if `thisOp.retain` is a non-empty string or object, which would alter the logic of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `thisOp.retain` is a string equal to `'insert'`, not if it is a non-null value or object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `thisOp.retain` is not a number, not if it is a non-null value or object.

DONE.
