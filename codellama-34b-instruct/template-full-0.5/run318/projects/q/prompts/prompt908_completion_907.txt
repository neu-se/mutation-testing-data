  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function, while `null` would refer to a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function, while `undefined` would refer to an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function, while `[]` would refer to an empty array.

DONE.
