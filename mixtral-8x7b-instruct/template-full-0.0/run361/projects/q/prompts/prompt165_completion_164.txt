 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check one extra iteration, potentially accessing an undefined value in the `lines` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i in lines
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `i` is a property of the `lines` array, rather than checking if `i` is a valid index. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `lines` array has additional properties.

DONE.
