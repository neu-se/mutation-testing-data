  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation at the specified index, rather than the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation before the specified index, rather than the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation after the specified index, rather than the next operation.

DONE.
