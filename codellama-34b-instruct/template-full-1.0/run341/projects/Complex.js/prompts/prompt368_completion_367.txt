  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*
```
This would result in different behavior because `b*` would perform a bitwise AND operation, which is not the same as the original code `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b+1` would add 1 to the value of `b`, which is not the same as the original code `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b-1` would subtract 1 from the value of `b`, which is not the same as the original code `b`.

DONE.
