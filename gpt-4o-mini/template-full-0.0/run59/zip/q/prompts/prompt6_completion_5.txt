Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the type of `module` as a string instead of an object, which would cause the module export to fail in environments where `module` is indeed an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the type of `exports` as a function instead of an object, which would prevent the module from being exported correctly in CommonJS environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `module` is undefined, which would lead to the module not being exported in environments where `module` is defined, such as Node.js.

DONE.
