  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `delta` object instead of a new `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new `Delta` object with a different internal state than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.compose(delta)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new `Delta` object with a different internal state than the original code.

DONE.
