 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object wrapper around the input, potentially changing the behavior of the `isObject` check and other property checks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{...point}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the input, potentially changing the behavior of the `isObject` check and other property checks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the input with an empty object, causing the function to throw a `TypeError` instead of performing the expected checks.

DONE.
