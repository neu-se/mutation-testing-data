  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error('Invalid argument'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not throw an error, but this modified code fragment would throw an error for any invalid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a complex number with both real and imaginary parts set to NaN, but this modified code fragment would return a complex number with only the real part set to NaN and the imaginary part set to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid argument');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not throw an error, but this modified code fragment would throw an error for any invalid argument.

DONE.
