  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as an argument when the stream ends, which indicates that there is no more data to read. If `undefined` is used instead, the `cb` function will be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause the stream to be interpreted as still having data to read, leading to unexpected behavior.
