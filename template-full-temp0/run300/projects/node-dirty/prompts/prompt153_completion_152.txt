  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would cause the write stream to close immediately, whereas `uncork()` would allow the stream to continue writing data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would cause the write stream to close and emit an error, whereas `uncork()` would allow the stream to continue writing data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('');
```
This would result in different behavior because `write()` would cause the write stream to write an empty string, whereas `uncork()` would allow the stream to continue writing data.

DONE.
