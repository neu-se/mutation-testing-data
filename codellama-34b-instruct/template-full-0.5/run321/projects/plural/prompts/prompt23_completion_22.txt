  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the letter "i" at the end of the word, while the new code fragment uses the letter "e". This would cause the word "nucleus" to be pluralized as "nucleei" instead of "nuclei".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the letter "i" at the end of the word, while the new code fragment uses the letter "a". This would cause the word "nucleus" to be pluralized as "nuclea" instead of "nuclei".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
