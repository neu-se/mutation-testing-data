Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function being called from a callback-based function to a promise-based function, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections if the read operation fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because it would switch from an asynchronous read operation to a synchronous one, which could block the event loop and lead to performance issues, especially in a context where non-blocking I/O is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to read the file synchronously instead of asynchronously, which would not return a promise and could cause the function to return undefined or throw an error if the file does not exist.

DONE.
