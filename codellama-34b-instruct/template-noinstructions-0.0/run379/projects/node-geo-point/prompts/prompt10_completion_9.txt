  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is present in the `point` object, rather than checking if the `point` object has the `coordinates` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property is present in the `point` object, rather than checking if the `point` object has the `coordinates` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` property is present in the `point` object, rather than checking if the `point` object has the `coordinates` property.

DONE.
