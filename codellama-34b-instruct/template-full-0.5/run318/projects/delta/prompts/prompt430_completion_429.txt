  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this.index` as the argument for `this.peekLength()`, which is not the same as passing `this.index` as the argument for `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this.ops.length` as the argument for `this.peekLength()`, which is not the same as passing `this.ops.length` as the argument for `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `this.index + 1` as the argument for `this.peekLength()`, which is not the same as passing `
