  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not a function and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] || z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not a function and would always return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property is not a function and would always return `false`.

DONE.
