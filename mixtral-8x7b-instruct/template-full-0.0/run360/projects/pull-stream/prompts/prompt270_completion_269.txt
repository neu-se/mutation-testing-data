 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'object' === typeof stream.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream`'s constructor is an object, rather than checking if `stream` itself is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream !== null && 'object' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks if `stream` is not null, which was not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream instanceof Array && 'object' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `stream` is an instance of Array, rather than checking if `stream` is an object.

DONE.
