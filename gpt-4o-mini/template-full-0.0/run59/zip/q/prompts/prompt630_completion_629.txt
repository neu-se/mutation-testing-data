Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "delete" to "set", which would attempt to set a property instead of deleting it, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "delete" to "get", which would try to retrieve the value of the property instead of deleting it, thus not performing the intended action.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds an extra argument (`value`) to the "delete" operation, which is not expected and could lead to errors or unintended behavior in the promise handling.

DONE.
