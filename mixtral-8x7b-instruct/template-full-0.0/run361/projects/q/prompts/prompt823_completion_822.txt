 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be overwritten and not call the original error handling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nextTick.bind(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would use a bound version of `nextTick` instead of the original function, potentially causing issues with the execution order of the callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (error) { throw error; }
