 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `dispatch` method would be a number literal instead of the `op` variable. This could cause unexpected results or errors, depending on how the `dispatch` method is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument passed to the `dispatch` method would be `null` instead of the `op` variable. This could cause unexpected results or errors, depending on how the `dispatch` method is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'op'
