  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` is a number, while `data` is an object. The `filter` function expects a function that returns a boolean value, so `data.length` would not work as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.name` is a string, while `data` is an object. The `filter` function expects a function that returns a boolean value, so `data.name` would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.age
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.age` is a number, while `data` is an object. The `filter` function expects a function that returns a boolean value, so `data.age` would not work as expected.

DONE.
