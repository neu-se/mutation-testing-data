 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
desiredLines.concat.bind(desiredLines)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat.bind(desiredLines)()` creates a new array with the contents of `desiredLines`, but without joining the elements, resulting in an array instead of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
" ".concat.apply([], desiredLines)
```
This would result in different behavior because `" ".concat.apply([], desiredLines)` concatenates all the elements in `desiredLines` with a single space character, instead of joining them with line breaks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
desiredLines.map(function(line) { return line + "\n"; }).join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `desiredLines.map(function(line) { return line + "\n"; }).join('')` adds a newline character to each line before
