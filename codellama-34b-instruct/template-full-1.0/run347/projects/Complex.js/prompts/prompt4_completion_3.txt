  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is attempting to find the complex conjugate of a number, but the replacement code would always return zero, which is not the complex conjugate of any number.
 
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    cosh(x) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is attempting to find the cosine of a number, but the replacement code would always return a value greater than the actual cosine of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Complex.ONE.negate()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is attempting to find the complex conjugate of a number, but the replacement code would always return the negation of the complex number, which is not the complex conjugate of any number.

DONE.
