  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes `null` as the first argument, which could cause the `cb` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` only passes the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while this new code fragment passes `null` as the second argument, which could cause the `cb` function to behave differently.
