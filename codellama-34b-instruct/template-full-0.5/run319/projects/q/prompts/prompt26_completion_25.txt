  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `task + 1` is not a function and would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `task()` would be called with a different context than the original code, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `task.bind(null)` would create a new function with a different context than the original code, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
