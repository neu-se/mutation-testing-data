  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, which means there is at least one element in the array. However, if we replace it with `other.ops.length < 0`, it would check if the length of the `other.ops` array is less than 0, which is always false. Therefore, the `concat` method would always return an empty `Delta` object, even if there are elements in the `other.ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the `other.ops` array is greater than 0, which means there is at least one element in the array. However, if we replace it with `other.ops.length === 0`, it would check if the length of the `other.ops` array is equal to
