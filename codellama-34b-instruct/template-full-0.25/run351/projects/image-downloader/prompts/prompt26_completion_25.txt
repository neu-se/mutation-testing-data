  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.get` is a function that sends a GET request, while `request` is a function that sends a request with the specified method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.post` is a function that sends a POST request, while `request` is a function that sends a request with the specified method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.put
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.put` is a function that sends a PUT request, while `request` is a function that sends a request with the specified method.

DONE.
