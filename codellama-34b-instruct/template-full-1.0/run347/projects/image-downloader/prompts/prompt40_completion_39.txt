  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'some_other_file.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a different file name than the original code fragment. The `createWriteStream()` function would create a new write stream for the file specified by the `filename` property, which is not the expected file in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a `null` file name instead of the expected file name. The `createWriteStream()` function would create a new write stream for the file specified by the `filename` property, which is not the expected file in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: !dest }
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a file name that is the logical negation of the expected file name. The `createWriteStream()` function would create a new write stream for the file specified by the `filename`
