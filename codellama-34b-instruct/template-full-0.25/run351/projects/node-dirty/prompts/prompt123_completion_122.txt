  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the queue is not empty and the stream is not waiting for a drain, but this modified code fragment would call `_flush` regardless of the queue's size or the stream's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 && this._waitForDrain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the queue is not empty and the stream is not waiting for a drain, but this modified code fragment would call `_flush` only if the queue is not empty and the stream is waiting for a drain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && !this._waitForDrain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the queue is not empty and the stream is not waiting
