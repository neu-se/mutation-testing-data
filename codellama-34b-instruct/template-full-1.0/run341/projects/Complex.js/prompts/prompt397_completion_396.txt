Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asinh']
```
This would result in different behavior because 'asinh' is a different function than 'asin', and it takes a different type of argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['sin']
```
This would result in different behavior because 'sin' is a different function than 'asin', and it takes a different type of argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['tan']
```
This would result in different behavior because 'tan' is a different function than 'asin', and it takes a different type of argument.
