Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is in the array, which would always return `false` if there are any unhandled rejections, leading to the `unhandledRejection` event never being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks only the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array against the `promise`, which means that if the `promise` is not the first unhandled rejection, it will not emit the `unhandledRejection` event, potentially missing other unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `unhandledRejections` array, which would lead to the `unhandledRejection` event being emitted based on the reasons for rejection rather
