  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key);

This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would be called on the `this._queue` object, which would delete the key-value pair from the queue, rather than the `delete` method being called on the `this._data` object, which would delete the key-value pair from the data store.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
