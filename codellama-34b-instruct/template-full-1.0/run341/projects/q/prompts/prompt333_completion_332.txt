  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the result of the previous promise resolution, which may not be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment may not use `Promise.resolve()` to create a new promise, and the resulting behavior could be different if the promise is resolved differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment may not use `reject()` to reject the promise, and the resulting behavior could be different if the promise is rejected differently.

DONE.
