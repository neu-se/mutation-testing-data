  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isExternalFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack frame is from an external file, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is from the same file as the Q library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack frame is from the Node.js runtime, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is from the same file as the Q library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isBrowserFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isBrowserFrame` checks if a stack frame is from a web browser, whereas `isInternalFrame` checks if a stack frame is from the same file as the Q library.

DONE.
