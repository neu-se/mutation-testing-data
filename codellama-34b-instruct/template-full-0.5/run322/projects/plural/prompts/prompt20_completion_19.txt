  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' to words that end with 'x', 'ch', or 's', while this new code fragment adds an 's' to all words that end with 'x', 'ch', or 's'. This would cause the plural function to return incorrect results for words that should have 'es' added to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 'es' to words that end with 'x', 'ch', or 's', while this new code fragment removes the last character of the word and then adds 'es'. This would cause the plural function to return incorrect results for words that should
