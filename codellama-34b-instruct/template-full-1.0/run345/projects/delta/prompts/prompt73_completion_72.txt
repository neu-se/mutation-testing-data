  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an item to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an item to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an item to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an item to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length = this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last item from the `ops` array, whereas `push` would add an item to the end of the array.

DONE.
