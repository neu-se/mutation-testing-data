  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if a string includes a certain substring, while `indexOf` checks if a string contains a certain substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` checks if a string matches a certain regular expression, while `indexOf` checks if a string contains a certain substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` checks if a string contains a certain substring and returns the index of the first occurrence, while `indexOf` checks if a string contains a certain substring and returns the index of the first occurrence.

DONE.
