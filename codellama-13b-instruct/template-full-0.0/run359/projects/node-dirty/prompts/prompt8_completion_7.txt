  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would not set any value for the given key, and the `get` method would return `undefined` for that key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value of the given key to `null`, and the `get` method would return `null` for that key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the value of the given key to `1`, and the `get` method would return `1` for that key.

DONE.
