  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `self` object, which is not the same as calling the `promiseDispatch` method on the `exception` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self.promiseDispatch.bind(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on the `exception` object, but it would bind the `this` context to the `exception` object, which may not be the same as the `this` context in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, Q.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the `exception` promise immediately, rather than waiting for the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on it.

DONE.
