  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` empty object would be passed as the attributes argument to `retDelta.delete`, which would cause the attributes of the deleted text to be cleared, rather than being preserved as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the attributes argument to `retDelta.delete`, which would cause the attributes of the deleted text to be preserved, rather than being cleared as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength, { fontSize: 24 });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fontSize` attribute would be set to `24` for the deleted text, rather than being preserved as in the original code.

DONE.
