  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would match "bison" even if it's written in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `g` and `i` flags
