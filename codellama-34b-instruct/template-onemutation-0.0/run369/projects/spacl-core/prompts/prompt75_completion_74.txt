  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if the result is `false`. This change would cause the `query` method to return `null` instead of `true` if the action is explicitly allowed, which could lead to incorrect authorization decisions.

DONE.
