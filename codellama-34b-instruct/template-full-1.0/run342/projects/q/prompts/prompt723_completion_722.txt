  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<name of object being passed as a promise>)
```
This would result in an error because the object is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(false && <name of object being passed as a promise>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` would make the expression always evaluate to `false`, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
((<name of object being passed as a promise>) !== <name of object being passed as a promise>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to `true`, causing the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
