  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.peek()` would return a different value than `op` and could potentially induce a different branch of execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op + 1` would produce a different result than `op` and could potentially induce a different branch of execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `op * 2` would produce a different result than `op` and could potentially induce a different branch of execution.

DONE.
