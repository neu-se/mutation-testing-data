  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is a different object than `attr`, and it may not have the same properties or methods as `attr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, which is the `AttributeMap` object in this case. Using `this` instead of `attr` would change the way the function accesses and modifies the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `attr`, and it may not have the same properties or methods as `attr`.

DONE.
