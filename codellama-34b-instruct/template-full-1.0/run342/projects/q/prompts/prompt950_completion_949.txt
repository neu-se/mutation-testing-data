  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` will reference the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `thisp` references the `thisp` parameter passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` will not have any properties, whereas `thisp` may have properties if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, whereas `thisp` may be any kind of object or value.

DONE.
