  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not defined in the original code, and therefore the `if (end)` statement would always evaluate to false. This would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called, which would result in the stream being read from the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (end)` statement would always evaluate to true, causing the `nextStream()` function to be called. This would result in the stream being read from the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if (end)` statement would always evaluate to false, causing the `nextChunk()` function to be called. This would result in the stream being read from the current position.

DONE.
