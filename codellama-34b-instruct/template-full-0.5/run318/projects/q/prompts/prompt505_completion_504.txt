  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of `value`, which could change the output of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the value of `value` by 2, which could change the output of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be subtracting 1 from the value of `value`, which could change the output of the program.

DONE.
