  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op) => op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, but this code fragment uses the `insert` property of the `Op` object to filter the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op) => op.delete !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, but this code fragment uses the `delete` property of the `Op` object to filter the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op) => op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, but this code fragment uses the `retain` property of the `Op` object to filter the array.

DONE.
