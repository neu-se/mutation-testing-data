  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the same reason and promise twice, which could lead to an incorrect state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a null promise, which could lead to an incorrect state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", null, unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a null reason, which could lead to an incorrect state.

DONE.
