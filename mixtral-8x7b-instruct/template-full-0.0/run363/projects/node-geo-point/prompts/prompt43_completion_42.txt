 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine function on the latitude value instead of the cosine function. This would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the value of 'c' to 0, regardless of the input values. This would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any_variable_name>
```
This would result in different behavior because it references an undefined variable. This would cause a runtime error and the code would not execute correctly.

DONE.
