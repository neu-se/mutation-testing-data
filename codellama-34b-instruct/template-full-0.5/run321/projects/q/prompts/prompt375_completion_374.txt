  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `threw` variable is not defined in the code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an exception to be thrown, which would be caught by the `catch` block and the `reject` function would be called with the exception as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the code inside the `if` block would not be executed.

DONE.
