 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('href', 'broken_link');
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed value 'broken\_link' to all 'a' elements' href attributes, instead of keeping their original values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let text = $(this).text('').trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the text of 'a' elements to an empty string, instead of keeping their original text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let text = $(this).attr('title') || $(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the 'title' attribute value as the text content if it exists, otherwise it uses the original text content. This change may cause incorrect or unexpected text values for 'a' elements without a title attribute.

DONE.
