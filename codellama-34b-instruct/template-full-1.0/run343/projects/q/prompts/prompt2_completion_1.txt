  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"q-"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string to the `bootstrap` function, instead of the expected `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a number to the `bootstrap` function, instead of the expected `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a boolean to the `bootstrap` function, instead of the expected `object`.

DONE.
