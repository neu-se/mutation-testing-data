  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `parseFloat` returns the floating-point number closest to a given string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.slice` returns a substring of a string, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.prototype.toFixed
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.prototype.toFixed` returns a string representation of a number with a fixed number of digits to the right of the decimal point, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

DONE.
