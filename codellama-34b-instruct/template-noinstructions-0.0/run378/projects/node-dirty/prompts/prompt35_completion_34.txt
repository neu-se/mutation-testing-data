  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be stored in the database as a distinct value from `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'undefined', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'undefined'` is not the same as the `undefined` value. It would be stored in the database as a string, rather than as a missing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, NaN, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` (Not a Number) is a special value in JavaScript that represents an invalid or undefined numerical value. It would be stored in the database as a distinct value from `undefined`.

DONE.
