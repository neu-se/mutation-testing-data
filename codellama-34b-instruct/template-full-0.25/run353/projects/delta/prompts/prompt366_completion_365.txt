  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without the parentheses would return the function object itself, which is unlikely to be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the next operation in the `otherIter` iterator, rather than the `thisIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the operation.

DONE.
