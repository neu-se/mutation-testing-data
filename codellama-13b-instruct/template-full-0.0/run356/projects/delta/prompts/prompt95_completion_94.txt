  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.prototype.splice()` to insert the new operation at the specified index, while the buggy code fragment uses `Array.prototype.splice()` to insert the new operation at the beginning of the array. This would cause the operations to be inserted in a different order, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Array.prototype.push()` to insert the new operation at the end of the array, while the buggy code fragment uses `Array.prototype.unshift()` to insert the new operation at the beginning of the array. This would cause the operations to be inserted in a different order, which could affect the behavior of the program.
