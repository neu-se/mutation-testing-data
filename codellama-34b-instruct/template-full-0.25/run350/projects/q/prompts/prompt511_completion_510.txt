  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of `args` and any other arrays passed as arguments, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.map(function(arg) { return arg + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array where each element is the result of calling the provided function on the corresponding element of `args`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
