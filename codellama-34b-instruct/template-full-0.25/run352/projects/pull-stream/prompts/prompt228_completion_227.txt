  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which will invert the truthiness of the `data` value. If `data` is truthy, `!data` will be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used to concatenate strings, and it will produce a different result if `data` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is an object, and `length` is a property of the object. If `data` is an array, `data.length` will return the length of the array, but if `data` is an object, it will return the number of properties in the object.

DONE.
