 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the `end` argument to the `done` callback, while this modification always passes `null` as the argument. This could expose issues in tests that expect the original behavior and don't handle the modified behavior correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(data)
