  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the newOp object onto the ops array, rather than returning the newOp object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the newOp object to the beginning of the ops array, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(randomNumber)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the newOp object at a random position in the ops array, rather than at the end.

DONE.
