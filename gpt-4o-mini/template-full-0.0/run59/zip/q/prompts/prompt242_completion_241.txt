Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `nearerValue` would cause the promise to not resolve to a valid value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise chains.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `nearerValue` would indicate that the promise has no value, which could lead to errors when the resolved value is expected to be used in subsequent operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string like `"error"` instead of `nearerValue` would change the type of the resolved value, which could cause type-related issues in any code that expects a promise or a specific type of value.

DONE.
