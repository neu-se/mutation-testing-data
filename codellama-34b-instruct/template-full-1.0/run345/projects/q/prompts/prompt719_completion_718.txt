  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `keys` expects an array of property names, not an array of integers. The call to `dispatch` would fail, and the promise would be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `keys` expects an array of property names, not an array of values. The call to `dispatch` would fail, and the promise would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `keys` expects an array of property names, not an object with a `length` property. The call to `dispatch` would fail, and the promise would be rejected.

DONE.
