  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JSON value, but it is not the same as `undefined`, which is the value that the original code fragment is expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is not the same as `undefined`, which is the value that the original code fragment is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, which is not the same as `undefined`, which is the value that the original code fragment is expecting.

DONE.
