  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a less-than-or-equal-to comparison, while the new code fragment uses a less-than comparison. This would cause the code to behave differently for inputs where `a` is equal to zero.

DONE.
