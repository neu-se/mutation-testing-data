Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an 's' to the result, which would incorrectly pluralize any string that matches the rule, even if the rule already provides a plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word) + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that the function in `rule[1]` always returns a string, and then appends an 's' to it, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization for words that already have a defined plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word, 'dummy')
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly passes a second argument ('dummy') to the function in `rule[1]`, which may not expect it, potentially causing errors or unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle additional parameters.

DONE.
