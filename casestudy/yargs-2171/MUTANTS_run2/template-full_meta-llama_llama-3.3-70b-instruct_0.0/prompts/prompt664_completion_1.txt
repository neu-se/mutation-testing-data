Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptions[key]!== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists and is not undefined, whereas the original code checks if the property exists as its own property, not inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptions.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the property exists as its own property, but does not account for properties that are inherited from the prototype chain, unlike the original code which uses `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
key in descriptions
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property exists anywhere in the prototype chain, not just as its own property, which could lead to false positives if the property is inherited from a parent object.

DONE.
