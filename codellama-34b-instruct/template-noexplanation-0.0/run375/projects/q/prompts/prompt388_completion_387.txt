  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This code fragment will cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Test error", which will be caught by the `when` function and passed to the `rejected` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject("Test error"); });
```
This code fragment will cause the promise to be rejected with the error "Test error", which will be caught by the `when` function and passed to the `rejected` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.resolve("Test error"); });
```
This code fragment will cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "Test error", which will be caught by the `when` function and passed to the `fulfilled` callback.

DONE.
