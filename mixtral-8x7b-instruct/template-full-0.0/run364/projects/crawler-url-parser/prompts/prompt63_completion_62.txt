 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code that follows it (`let parsedHost = psl.parse(ret.host);`) would not execute, and `ret.domain` and `ret.subdomain` would not be set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because trying to access the `host` property of `null` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'example.com'
