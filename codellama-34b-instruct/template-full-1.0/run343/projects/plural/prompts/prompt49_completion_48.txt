  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `[/\[^aeiouy\]+o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }]`
This would result in different behavior because this regular expression matches words that end with consonant + y, whereas the original rule only matched words that end with vowel + y.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `[/aeiouy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ious' }]`
This would result in different behavior because this regular expression matches words that end with vowel + y, whereas the original rule only matched words that end with consonant + y.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `[/.+$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }]`
This would result in different behavior because this regular expression matches any word, whereas the original rule only matched words that end with consonant + y.

DONE.
