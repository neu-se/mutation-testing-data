  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <empty string>;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).nodeify` is a function that takes an object and a nodeback callback, while `return <empty string>;` statement simply returns an empty string. The replacement would cause the function to exit early, and the nodeback callback would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).then(function(){});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).nodeify` is a function that takes an object and a nodeback callback, while `return Q(object).then(function(){});` statement creates a new promise using `Q(object)` and then returns the result of the promise asynchronously using `then` function. The replacement would cause the function to return a promise instead of a value, and the nodeback callback would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).catch(function(){});
```
