  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.parent
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to check if the `path` is governed by a policy in the `ctx.parent` context, rather than the `ctx` context. This could potentially cause the method to return a different result than the original code fragment, which would indicate a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.parent.parent
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to check if the `path` is governed by a policy in the `ctx.parent.parent` context, rather than the `ctx` context. This could potentially cause the method to return a different result than the original code fragment, which would indicate a bug in the test suite.
