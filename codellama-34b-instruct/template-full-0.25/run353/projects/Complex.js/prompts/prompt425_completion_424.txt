  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
