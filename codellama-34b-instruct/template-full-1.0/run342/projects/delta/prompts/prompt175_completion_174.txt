  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const firstOther = otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `thisIter.peekLength();` is used to get the length of the current operation in the iterator, but replacing it with `const firstOther = otherIter.peek();` would result in assigning the current operation in the iterator to a variable named `firstOther`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the length of the operation for some reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let otherOp = otherIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `otherIter.peek();` is used to retrieve the next operation in the iterator, but replacing it with `let otherOp = otherIter.next();` would result in retrieving and assigning the next operation to a variable named `otherOp`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the current operation for some reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
