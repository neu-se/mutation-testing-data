  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[1], point.coordinates[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the latitude and longitude values, causing the resulting `GeoPoint` object to have the wrong coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] + 1, point.coordinates[1] + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to both the latitude and longitude values, causing the resulting `GeoPoint` object to be offset from the original coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] * 2, point.coordinates[1] * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double both the latitude and longitude values, causing the resulting `GeoPoint` object to be twice as far away from the original coordinates.
