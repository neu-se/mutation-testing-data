  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this['im']` is zero, whereas this replacement checks if it is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['im']` is not zero, whereas this replacement checks if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is less than or equal to `z['re']`, whereas this replacement checks if it is greater than `z['re']`.

DONE.
