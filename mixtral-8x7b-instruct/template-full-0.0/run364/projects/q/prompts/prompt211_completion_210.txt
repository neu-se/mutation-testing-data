 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` variable is being explicitly set to `null`, which would cause the callback to be invoked with one less argument than it was originally expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback, [1, 2, 3]
