  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using the default separator of a space, while this new code fragment splits the string into an array of substrings using an empty string as the separator, which would result in a different array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.indexOf('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment finds the index of the first occurrence of a space in the string, while this new code fragment finds the index of the first occurrence of an empty string in the string, which would result in a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace(' ', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of a space in the string with an empty string, while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences of an empty string in the string with an empty string, which
