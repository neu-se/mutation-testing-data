 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the global `Math.cosh` function instead of the `cosh` method from the Complex class. This could lead to incorrect results when working with complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d = Math.cos(a) + d;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly add `d` to the cosine of `a`, instead of subtracting it. This would lead to incorrect results in the `cot` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d = Math.cos(b) - d;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `d` from the cosine of `b`, instead of adding it. This would lead to incorrect results in the `sec` method.

DONE.
