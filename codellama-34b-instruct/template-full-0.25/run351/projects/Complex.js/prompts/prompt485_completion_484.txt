  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'function'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the `define()` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the `define()` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'number'` instead of `'object'`, which would cause the `define()` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
