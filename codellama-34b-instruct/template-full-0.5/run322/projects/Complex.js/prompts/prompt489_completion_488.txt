  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an object with a property "value" set to true, while the mutated code fragment would return an object with a property "value" set to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an object with a property "value" set to true, while the mutated code fragment would return an object with a property "value" set to null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return an object with a property "value" set to true, while the mutated code fragment would return an object with a property "value" set to undefined.

DONE.
