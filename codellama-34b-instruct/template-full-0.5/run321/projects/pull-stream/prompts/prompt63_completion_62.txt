  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the short-circuiting OR operator, which evaluates to `end` if it is truthy, and `abort` otherwise. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the bitwise OR operator, which always evaluates to `true` if either `end` or `abort` is truthy. This means that the new code fragment will always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is falsy and `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the short-circuiting OR operator, which evaluates to `end` if it is truthy, and `abort` otherwise. In contrast, the new code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to invert the value of `end`, and then uses the bitwise AND operator to combine the inverted `end` with `abort`. This means that
