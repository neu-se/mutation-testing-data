  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment simply references the variable `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the value of `i`, whereas the original code fragment simply references the variable `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator subtracts 1 from the value of `i`, whereas the original code fragment simply references the variable `i`.

DONE.
