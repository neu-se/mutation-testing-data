  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with an incorrect line number, which could cause the test to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with an incorrect line number, which could cause the test to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with an incorrect line number, which could cause the test to fail or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
