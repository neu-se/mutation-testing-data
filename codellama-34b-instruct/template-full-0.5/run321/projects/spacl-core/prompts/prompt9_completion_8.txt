  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of `//` in the path, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match `//` in a case-insensitive manner, which could lead to false positives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match `//` in a single-line mode, which would allow it to match `//` even if it is not at the beginning of a line.

DONE.
