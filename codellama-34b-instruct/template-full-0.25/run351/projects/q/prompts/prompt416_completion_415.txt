  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, and the `state` property is set to "rejected" when the promise is rejected. In the original code, the `isPending` function checks if the promise is pending by checking if its state is "pending". By replacing the `object` with `object.inspect().state === "rejected"`, the function will return `true` if the promise is rejected, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, and the `state` property is set to "fulfilled" when the promise is fulfilled. In the original code, the `isPending` function checks if the promise is pending by checking if its state
