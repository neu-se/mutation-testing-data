  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would not be emitted, which is necessary for the `Dirty` class to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted, but the `close` event would not be emitted, which could cause issues with the `Dirty` class's cleanup functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted, but the `drain` event would not be emitted, which could cause issues with the `Dirty` class's write buffering functionality.

DONE.
