  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element at a given index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element at a given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `splice()` removes elements from the original array.

DONE.
