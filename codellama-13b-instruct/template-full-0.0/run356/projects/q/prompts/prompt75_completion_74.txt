  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestPortTick` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `requestPortTick` is called as a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(requestPortTick, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestPortTick` function is called asynchronously, whereas the original code fragment `requestPortTick` is called synchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestPortTick` function is bound to the `this` context, whereas the original code fragment `requestPortTick` is not bound to any context.

DONE.
