  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `array_slice` function, while the original code passes all arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `arguments` object to the `array_slice` function, rather than the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first one to the `array_slice` function, rather than passing all arguments.

DONE.
