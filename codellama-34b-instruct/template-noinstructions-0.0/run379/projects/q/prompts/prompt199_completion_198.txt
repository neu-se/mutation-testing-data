  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `captureLine` function to be executed even if `hasStacks` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `captureLine` function to be executed even if `hasStacks` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks && typeof console !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the `captureLine` function if `hasStacks` is true and `console` is defined.

DONE.
