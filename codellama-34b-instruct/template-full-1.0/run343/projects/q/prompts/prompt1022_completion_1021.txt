  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on the object, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", ["differentName", nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the method being called, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.concat("differentExtraArg")]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the arguments passed to the method, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
