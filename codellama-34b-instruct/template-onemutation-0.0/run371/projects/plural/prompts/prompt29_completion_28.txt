  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "es" to form the plural of "thesis" and "crisis", while the new code fragment uses "is".

DONE.
