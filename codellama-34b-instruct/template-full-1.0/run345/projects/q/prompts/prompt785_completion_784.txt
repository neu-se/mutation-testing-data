  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected function would not be called, and the error would not be handled as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be caught by the `then` method, but the `rejected` function would not be called, and the error would not be handled as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately, rather than being caught by the `then` method.

DONE.
