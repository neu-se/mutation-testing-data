 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => laterQueue.length && laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function and the `shift` method instead of `pop`, which might affect the order of processing elements in `laterQueue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
laterQueue.slice(-1)[0]
