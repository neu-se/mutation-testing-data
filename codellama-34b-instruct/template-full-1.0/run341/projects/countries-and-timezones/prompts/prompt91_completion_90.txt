  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new country object instead of using the memoized version.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the country object using the id as a key, which would likely return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country object instead of the object itself.

DONE.
