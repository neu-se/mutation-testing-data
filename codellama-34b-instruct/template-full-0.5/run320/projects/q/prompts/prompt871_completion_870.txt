  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be reversed before being passed to the callback, which could potentially cause issues if the callback relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument would be removed from the `args` array before being passed to the callback, which could potentially cause issues if the callback relies on the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["foo"])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be concatenated with the string "foo" before being passed to the callback, which could potentially cause issues if the callback does not expect an additional argument.

DONE.
