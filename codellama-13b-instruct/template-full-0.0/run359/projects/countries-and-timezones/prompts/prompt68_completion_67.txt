  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeCountry` function would not be called if the `country` argument is null, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `getCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeCountry` function would not be called if the `country.id` property is falsey, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.id !== 'US'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeCountry` function would not be called if the `country.id` property is not equal to 'US', which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
