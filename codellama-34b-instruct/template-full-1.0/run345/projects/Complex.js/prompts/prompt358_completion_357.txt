  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment modifies the value of `a` before using it, while this replacement code fragment does not. This could cause errors in the logic of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` instead of `a`, while this replacement code fragment uses `a`. This could cause errors in the logic of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses only `a` and `b`, while this replacement code fragment uses `a`, `b`, and `c`. This could cause errors in the logic of the program.

DONE.
