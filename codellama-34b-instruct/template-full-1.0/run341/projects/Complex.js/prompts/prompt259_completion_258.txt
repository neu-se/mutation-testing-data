  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
logHypot(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is calling a different function than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is using a different base for the logarithm than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is calculating the square root of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, whereas the original code is calculating the logarithm of the hypotenuse.

DONE.
