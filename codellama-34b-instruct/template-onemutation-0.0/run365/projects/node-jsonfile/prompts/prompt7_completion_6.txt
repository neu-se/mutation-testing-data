  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.readFile`, which means that it will block the event loop until the file is read, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous version that returns a promise.

DONE.
