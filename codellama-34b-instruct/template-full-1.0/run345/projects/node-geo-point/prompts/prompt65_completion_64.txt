  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of Δλ, which is used to calculate the angular distance between the two points. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, potentially leading to errors in navigation or geographic applications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + π
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add π to the value of Δλ, which would flip the direction of the angular distance between the two points. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, potentially leading to errors in navigation or geographic applications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the value of Δλ, which is used to calculate the angular distance between the two points. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect, potentially leading to errors in navigation or geographic applications.

DONE.
