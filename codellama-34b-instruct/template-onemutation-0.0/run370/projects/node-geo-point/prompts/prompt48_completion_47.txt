  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(φ1)` is used to convert the latitude of the first point to radians, but `deg2rad(φ2)` is used to convert the latitude of the second point to radians, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.
