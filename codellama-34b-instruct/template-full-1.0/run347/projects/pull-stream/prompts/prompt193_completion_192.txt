  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while the modified code fragment checks if `aborted` is false. This change would likely cause the `cb(aborted)` line to be executed differently, potentially resulting in a different error or no error at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while the modified code fragment checks if `aborted` is null. This change would likely cause the `cb(aborted)` line to be executed differently, potentially resulting in a different error or no error at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && aborted.someProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is true, while the modified code fragment checks if `aborted` is an object with a `someProperty
