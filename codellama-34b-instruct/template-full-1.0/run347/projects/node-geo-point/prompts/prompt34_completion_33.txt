  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arcsin(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` returns the inverse cosine of a number, while `arcsin(r)` would return the inverse sine of a number. Using `arcsin` instead of `acos` would likely change the output of `calculateDistance` and cause any tests that rely on that function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(2*r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(2*r)` would return the cosine of twice the input value, while `cos` returns the cosine of a single input value. Using `cos(2*r)` instead of `cos` would likely change the output of `calculateDestination` and cause any tests that rely on that function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `random.random()` returns a random number rather
