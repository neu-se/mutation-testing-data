  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PLACEHOLDER = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor in the formula for `r` would always be zero, causing the result to always be `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PLACEHOLDER = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor in the formula for `r` would always be one, causing the result to always be `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PLACEHOLDER = (point2.longitude - point1.longitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because the divisor in the formula for `r` would be different depending on the longitude difference between the two points.

DONE.
