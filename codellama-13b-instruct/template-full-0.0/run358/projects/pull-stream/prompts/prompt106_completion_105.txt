  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function is called immediately, whereas the original code fragment simply references the `done` function without calling it. This could cause the test to pass even if the `onEnd` function is not properly handling the `done` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function is called with a `null` argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `done` function. This could cause the test to pass even if the `onEnd` function is not properly handling the `done` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error('test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function is called with an `Error` object, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `done` function. This could cause the test to fail if the `
