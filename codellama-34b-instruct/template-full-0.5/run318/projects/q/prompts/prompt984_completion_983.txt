  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, while `undefined` would reject the promise with no error, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("ERROR")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, while `deferred.reject("ERROR")` would reject the promise with a specific error message, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

DONE.
