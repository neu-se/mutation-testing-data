 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a real number (1) instead of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the real part of the complex number, ignoring the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input.

DONE.
