  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always trim the text, regardless of whether it contains a URL or not, and would not use the `result_normalize_options` object to determine how to trim the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().filter((x, y) => x === '#' || y === '#');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only trim the text if it contains the `#` character at the beginning or end of the string, and would not use the `result_normalize_options` object to determine how to trim the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(' ').join('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the text on spaces and then join the resulting array with an empty string, effectively removing all spaces from the text, regardless of whether it contains a URL
