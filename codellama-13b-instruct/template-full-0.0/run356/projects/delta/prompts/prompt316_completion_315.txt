  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `length()` method, and without them, the code would not compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is a number, and without the parentheses, it would be treated as a function, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is a number, and adding 1 to it would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
