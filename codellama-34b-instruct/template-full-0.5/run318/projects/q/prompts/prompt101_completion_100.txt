  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used to set the `this` context of the `callback` function to `this` (the global object in non-strict mode), rather than the `basis` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, [basis, this[index], index])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is being used to call the `callback` function with an array of arguments, rather than a list of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(basis, this[index], index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is being called directly without using the `call` or `apply` methods, and the `this` context of the function would be set to the global object in non-strict mode.
