  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(null).trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to call the `text()` method on the current element, passing in `null` as an argument, which would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(undefined).trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to call the `text()` method on the current element, passing in `undefined` as an argument, which would cause the method to return an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text(0).trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to call the `text()` method on the current element, passing in `0` as an argument, which would cause the method to return the string representation of the number `0`.

DONE.
