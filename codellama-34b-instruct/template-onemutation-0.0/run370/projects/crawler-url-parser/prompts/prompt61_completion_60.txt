  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a resolved URL string, whereas `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string. In the context of the code, `URL.resolve` would cause the `baseUrl` to be ignored, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.
