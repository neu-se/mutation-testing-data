  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable, which is an object, and the `null` keyword is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable, which is an object, and the `undefined` keyword is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `value` variable, which is an object, and the `value.length` property is a number.

DONE.
