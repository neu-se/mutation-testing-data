  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `null` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(undefined, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `undefined` instead of `resolvedPromise`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method with a single argument, `args`, instead of two arguments, `resolvedPromise` and `args`. This would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
