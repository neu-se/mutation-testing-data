  The answer is incomplete because there are nine placeholders to be replaced, but only one code fragment was given.  

Here are three possible buggy code fragments that can replace the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[a-z]i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any letter in the range of a-z, regardless of case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[^a-z]i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any letter that is not in the range of a-z, regardless of case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\b\w{30}\b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any word with 30 characters, regardless of case, and regardless of whether it is a valid English word.

DONE.
