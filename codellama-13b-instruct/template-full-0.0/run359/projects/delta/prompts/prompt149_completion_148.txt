  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be false, and the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true, and the code inside the `if` statement would be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true, and the code inside the `if` statement would be executed.

DONE.
