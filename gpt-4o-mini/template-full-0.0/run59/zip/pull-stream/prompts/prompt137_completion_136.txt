Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback if `end` is explicitly `null`, whereas the original code calls the callback for any falsy value (like `undefined`, `0`, or `false`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback if `end` is a positive number, ignoring other falsy values and potentially leading to unexpected behavior when `end` is negative or zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call the callback if `end` is an instance of the `Error` object, which means that valid error handling scenarios would be ignored if `end` is any other type of value.

DONE.
