Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrlStr` is strictly equal to `null`, which would not account for the case where `currentUrlStr` is `undefined`, potentially allowing further execution when it should return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `true` for any falsy value (including `undefined`, `null`, `''`, `0`, etc.), which could lead to returning `null` for cases that should be valid URLs, thus allowing more URLs to be processed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrlStr` is not a string, which would allow non-string values (like numbers or objects) to pass through, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the URL parsing logic.

DONE.
