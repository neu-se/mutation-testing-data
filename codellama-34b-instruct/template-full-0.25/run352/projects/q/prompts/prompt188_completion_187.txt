  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attempt2` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the second element of the `attempt2` array is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] !== attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attempt2` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the second element of the `attempt2` array is not equal to the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt2[1] < attempt2[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attempt2` is truthy, while this replacement checks if the second element of the `attempt2` array is less than the first element.

DONE.
