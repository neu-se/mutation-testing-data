  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because 'test' is a string and 'toLowerCase' returns a string with all characters in lower case. If the test is case-sensitive, this would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + "hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because '+' operator concatenates the string 'test' with the string 'hello'. This would cause the test to fail if it is checking for a specific string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){return test;}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is being created and returned instead of the original string 'test'. This would cause the test to fail if it is checking for a string or if it is expecting a specific function.

DONE.
