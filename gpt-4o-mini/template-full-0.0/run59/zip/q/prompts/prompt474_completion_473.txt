Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array at the first index instead of the index where it was found, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the promise from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array at the second index, which may not correspond to the actual index of the promise, leading to incorrect state management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array at the index immediately following the found index, which could lead to skipping the correct promise and causing inconsistencies in the tracking of handled rejections.

DONE.
