  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `globPart` variable as-is, while this modified code fragment uppercases the `globPart` variable before using it. This could potentially cause the glob pattern to match different files or directories.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `globPart` variable as-is, while this modified code fragment reverses the order of the characters in the `globPart` variable before using it. This could potentially cause the glob pattern to match different files or directories.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `globPart` variable as-is, while this modified code fragment removes all letters from the `globPart` variable
