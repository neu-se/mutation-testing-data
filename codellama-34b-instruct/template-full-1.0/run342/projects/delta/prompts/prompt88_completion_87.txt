  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newOp.insert && typeof lastOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!newOp.insert` check would always evaluate to `true` if `newOp.insert` is not a string, which would cause the code to execute the `else` block and create a new operation. If `newOp.insert` is a string, then the condition would always evaluate to `false` because `!newOp.insert` would be `false`, so the code would not execute the `else` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(newOp.insert) && typeof lastOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `newOp.insert` is an array, then the condition would always evaluate to `true`, causing the code to execute the `else` block and create a new operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert.constructor ===
