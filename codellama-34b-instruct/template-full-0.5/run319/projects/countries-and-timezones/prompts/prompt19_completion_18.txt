  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a different property than `id`, and it may not be present in the `tz` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different property than `id`, and it may not be present in the `tz` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because `c` is a different property than `id`, and it may not be present in the `tz` object.

DONE.
