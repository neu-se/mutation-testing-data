  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(<PLACEHOLDER>), 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to `array_slice()` is an empty array, which would return an empty array, whereas the original code fragment would return an array containing the second argument onwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to `array_slice()` is an array containing only the length of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment would return an array containing the second argument onwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to `array_slice()` is the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment would return an array containing the second argument onwards.

DONE.
