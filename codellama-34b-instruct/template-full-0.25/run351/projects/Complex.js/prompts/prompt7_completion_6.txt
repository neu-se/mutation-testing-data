  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.abs` have different ranges and output values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` and `Math.abs` have different ranges and output values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` and `Math.abs` have different ranges and output values.

DONE.
