  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.filter((attribute) => attribute !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any attributes with a value of `null`, which would change the result of the `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the last element of the `attributes` array, which would change the result of the `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.values` method would return an array of attribute values, which would change the type of the `attributes` variable and potentially cause the `reduce` method to fail.

DONE.
