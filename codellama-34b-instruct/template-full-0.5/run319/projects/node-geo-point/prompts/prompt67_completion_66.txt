  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the value would be flipped, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be incremented by 1, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
