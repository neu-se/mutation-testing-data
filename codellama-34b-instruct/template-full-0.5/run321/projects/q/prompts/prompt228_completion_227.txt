  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `messages` array, causing the code to behave differently when the array is accessed or modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array.

DONE.
