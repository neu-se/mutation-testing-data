  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same number of characters as the original code, but the retain attribute would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same number of characters as the original code, but the retain attribute would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the same number of characters as the original code, but the retain attribute would be different.

DONE.
