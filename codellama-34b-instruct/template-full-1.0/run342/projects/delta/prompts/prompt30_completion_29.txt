  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || attr[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` (or) operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the values of `attr[key]` and `base[key]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` (strict equality) operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the values of `attr[key]` and `base[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] || attr[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` (or) operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the values of `attr[key]` and `base[key]`.

DONE.
