 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `find` function would return immediately for any input, regardless of the `test` function's result. This is because the replacement function always returns `true`, causing the `if (test(data))` condition to always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data => data.length > 5
