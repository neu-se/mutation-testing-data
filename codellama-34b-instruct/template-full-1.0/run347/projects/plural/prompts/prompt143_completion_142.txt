  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of a variable. In this case, `typeof` would return "undefined" when called on the `rule` object, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule` is an object with a `type` property, and `rule.type` would return the value of that property, which may be a different string than the one returned by the `type` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call` is a different function than `type`, and it returns a different string representation of the `rule` object.

DONE.
