 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { domain.exit(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps `domain.exit()` in an anonymous function, potentially causing issues with context and preventing `domain.exit()` from being called directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
domain['exit']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation to access the `exit` method, which may not behave the same way as the dot notation in certain edge cases, such as when the `domain` object has a property with the name "exit" that is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.process.domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `exit` method of the `domain` property of the `global.process` object, which may not be the intended object in this context.

DONE.
