  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array would be swapped, potentially causing the `set` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `null` value would cause the `set` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `undefined` value would cause the `set` method to fail.

DONE.
