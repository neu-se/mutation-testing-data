  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `var` keyword, which would have caused a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `reject` method call, which means that the promise would not be rejected if an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `resolve` method call, which means that the promise would not be resolved with the expected value.

DONE.
