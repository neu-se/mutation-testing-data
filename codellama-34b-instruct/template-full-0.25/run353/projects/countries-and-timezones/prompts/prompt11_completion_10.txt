  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `result[country]` object with a new object, rather than updating the existing object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `current` and `all` properties of the `result[country]` object to arrays containing only the `id` value, rather than updating the existing arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [...result[country].current, id], all: [...result[country].all, id] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the `current` and `all` properties of the `result[country]` object by concatenating the existing
