Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a string method that extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, whereas `replace` is used to replace a part of a string with another string, so using `slice` instead would not remove the trailing zeros from the float number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string method that returns an array containing the match and its groups, or null if there is no match, whereas `replace` is used to replace a part of a string with another string, so using `match` instead would not remove the trailing zeros from the float number and would return an array instead of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
val.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a string method that splits a string into an array of substrings, whereas `replace` is used to replace a part of a string with another string, so using `split` instead would not remove
