  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `Q.onerror` is not defined, while this new code fragment would always throw an error, regardless of whether `Q.onerror` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, while this new code fragment would always throw an error, regardless of whether the `callback` argument is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, while this new code fragment would always throw an error, regardless of whether the `callback` argument is a function.

DONE.
