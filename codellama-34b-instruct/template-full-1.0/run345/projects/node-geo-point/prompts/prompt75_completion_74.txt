  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(bearing * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is multiplied by 2, which would cause the calculated destination to be twice as far away from the input point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(bearing - 90)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is subtracted by 90, which would cause the calculated destination to be in a different direction from the input point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(bearing / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is divided by 2, which would cause the calculated destination to be half as far away from the input point.

DONE.
