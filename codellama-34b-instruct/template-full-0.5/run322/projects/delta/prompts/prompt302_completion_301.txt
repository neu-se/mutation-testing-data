  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would change the number of characters in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(3).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would change the number of characters in the line.

DONE.
