  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `delete` operator, which is used to delete properties from objects, while the new code fragment is using the `delete` method, which is not a valid method for objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `delete` operator, which is used to delete properties from objects, while the new code fragment is using the `remove` method, which is not a valid method for objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"clear"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `delete` operator, which is used to delete properties from objects, while the new code fragment is using the `clear` method, which is not a valid method for objects.

DONE.
