 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["setProperty", key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is an invalid method, while `setProperty` is a valid method in JavaScript. However, it is not a method in the Q library, so it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["delete", key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a valid JavaScript keyword used to delete object properties, but it is not used to set properties. This would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["set", value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments for the `set` method is incorrect. The correct order is `["set", key, value]`. Swapping the arguments would cause the method to perform a different operation, possibly leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
