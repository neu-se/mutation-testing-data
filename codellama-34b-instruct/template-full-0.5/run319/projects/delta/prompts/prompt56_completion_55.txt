  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `ops` refers to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.slice(1)` creates a new array starting from the second element, whereas `ops` refers to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(0, ops.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.slice(0, ops.length - 1)` creates a new array with the same elements as `ops` except for the last element, whereas `ops` refers to the original array.

DONE.
