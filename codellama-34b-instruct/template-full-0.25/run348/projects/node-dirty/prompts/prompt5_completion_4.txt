  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete a key that is not present in the map, which would not have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete a key that is not present in the map, which would not have any effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would attempt to delete a key that is not present in the map, which would not have any effect.

DONE.
