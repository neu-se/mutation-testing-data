  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is replaced with `a + 1`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is replaced with `a * 2`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is replaced with `a - 1`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
