 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if the imaginary part is exactly equal to zero, while this change would cause the function to return a real exponent when the imaginary part is positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] !== 0
