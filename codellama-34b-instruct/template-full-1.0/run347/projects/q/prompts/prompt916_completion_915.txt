  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nfapply(callback, baseArgs);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be missing the key step of resolving the deferred promise, which would cause the function to return the result of `Q.nfapply()` without waiting for the promise to resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nfapply(callback, baseArgs).value();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be resolving the deferred promise but returning only its value, which would lose the benefits of using a promise in the first place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nfapply(callback, baseArgs).resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be resolving the deferred promise but returning the result of `resolve()`, which would be the resolved value of the deferred promise.

DONE.
