  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength` as a variable, while the replaced code uses `otherIter.peekLength()` as a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength` as a variable, while the replaced code uses `otherIter.peekLength + 1` as a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `otherIter.peekLength` as a variable, while the replaced code uses `otherIter.peekLength - 1` as a different value.

DONE.
