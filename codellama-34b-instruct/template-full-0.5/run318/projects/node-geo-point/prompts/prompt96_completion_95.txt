  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + sinθ * sinδ * cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude of the destination point, while this modified code uses the `sin` and `cos` functions to calculate the latitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + cosθ * cosδ * sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude of the destination point, while this modified code uses the `cos` and `sin` functions to calculate the longitude of the destination point.
