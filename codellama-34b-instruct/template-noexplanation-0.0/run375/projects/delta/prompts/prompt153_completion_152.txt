  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This change will cause the `while` loop to use the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This change will cause the `while` loop to use the `hasNext` method of the `thisIter` iterator, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This change will cause the `while` loop to use the `hasNext` method of the `otherIter` iterator, which may result in different behavior depending on the specific implementation of the `other` delta.

DONE.
