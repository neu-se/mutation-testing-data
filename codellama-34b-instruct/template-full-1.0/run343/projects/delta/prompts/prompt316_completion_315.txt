  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(otherOp.len)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.len` would return the length of the `otherOp` object instead of the length of the string insertion, which would cause the program's behavior to differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the characters from `retDelta` instead of pushing the characters from `otherIter` to `retDelta`, which would cause the program's behavior to differ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(opLength, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the characters from `retDelta` with the attributes of the `otherOp` object instead of the attributes of `thisOp`, which would cause the program's behavior to differ.

DONE.
