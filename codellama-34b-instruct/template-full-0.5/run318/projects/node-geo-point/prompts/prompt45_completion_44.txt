  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 0 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, which checks if the value of `r` is greater than 1. If `r` is greater than 1, the function returns 1. If `r` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `r`.

In contrast, the modified code fragment uses the greater-than-or-equal-to operator, which checks if the value of `r` is greater than or equal to 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1. If `r` is less than 0, the function returns `r`.

This change in behavior would cause the function to return a different value than expected in some cases. For example, if `r` is equal to 0.5, the original code fragment would return 0.5, while the modified code fragment would return 1.
