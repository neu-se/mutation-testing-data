 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always write to the file named 'file' instead of using the provided file name in the `file` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write to the current working directory with the name of the provided file as a subdirectory, instead of writing to the file directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend './' to the file name, which could cause issues if the file is not located in the same directory as the script.

DONE.
