Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately uncork the write stream without waiting for the queued writes to finish, potentially leading to data being written out of order or incomplete writes if the queue is not empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` as an argument (if the method were to accept it) could imply that the uncorking should happen regardless of the state of the write stream, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the stream is not ready.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `uncork` method were to interpret `false` as a signal to not proceed with uncorking, it would prevent any data from being flushed to the stream, effectively stalling the write process.

DONE.
