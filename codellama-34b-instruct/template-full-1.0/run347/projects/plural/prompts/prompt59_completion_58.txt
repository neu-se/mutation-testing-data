  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment because it also refers to the plural form of the word "criterion".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment because it refers to the same plural form of the word "criterion".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterionz'
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code fragment because it refers to a different plural form of the word "criterion".

DONE.
