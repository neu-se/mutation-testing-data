  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a no-op function that does nothing, whereas `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because `{ }` is an empty object, whereas `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value, whereas `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

DONE.
