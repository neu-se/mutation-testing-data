  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `domain` variable, which is used to check if the current environment is NodeJS. If `domain` is truthy, it means we are in a NodeJS environment, and the code would execute the branch for NodeJS. If `domain` is falsy, it means we are not in a NodeJS environment, and the code would execute the branch for browsers. By negating `domain`, we are essentially swapping the branches, so that the code for browsers would execute for NodeJS and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `domain` variable is undefined. If `domain` is undefined, it means we are not in a NodeJS environment, and the code would execute the branch for browsers. If `domain` is not undefined, it means we are in a NodeJS environment, and the code would execute the branch for NodeJS. By checking if `domain
