  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not a property of the `object` and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not a property of the `object` and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect() !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not a property of the `object` and would throw an error.

DONE.
