  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `end`, regardless of its previous value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always invert the value of `end`, regardless of its previous value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = opts.end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to the value of `opts.end`, regardless of its previous value.

DONE.
