  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise with a given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("Test error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error object, whereas the original code fragment resolves the promise with a given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.then(function() { return Q.resolve(new Error("Test error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a new error object, whereas the original code fragment rejects the promise with a given reason.

DONE.
