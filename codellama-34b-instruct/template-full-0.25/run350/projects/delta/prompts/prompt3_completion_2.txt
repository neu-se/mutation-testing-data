  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` create a deep copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy using a different mechanism.

DONE.
