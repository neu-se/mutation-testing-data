  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const newValue = value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new variable called `newValue` and assign the value of `value` to it, instead of using the original `value` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `value` by 1, instead of leaving it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `value` by 1, instead of leaving it unchanged.

DONE.
