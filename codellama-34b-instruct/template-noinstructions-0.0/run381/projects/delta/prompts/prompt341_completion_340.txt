  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the iterator, which would advance the iterator to the next operation and return it, whereas the original code fragment only accessed the next operation without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code fragment used `next()` to advance the iterator and retrieve the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas the original code fragment used `next()` to advance the iterator and retrieve the length of the next operation.

DONE.
