  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `otherOp` is equal to `null`, but if we replace it with `null`, it will always evaluate to `true`, which may cause the `diff()` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `otherOp` is equal to `undefined`, but if we replace it with `undefined`, it will always evaluate to `true`, which may cause the `diff()` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `otherOp` is equal to `0`, but if we replace it with `0`, it will always evaluate to `true`, which may cause the `diff()` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
