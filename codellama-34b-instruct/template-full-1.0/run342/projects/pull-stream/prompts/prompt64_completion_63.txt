  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(false && done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the logical AND operator to check if the `done` callback is truthy or not, while this change would always evaluate to false, even if `done` is a valid callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(done == null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the strict equality operator to check if `done` is null or not, while this change would check if `done` is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(!!done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the logical NOT operator to check if `done` is truthy or not, while this change would use the double NOT operator to ensure that `done` is a boolean value.

DONE.
