  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `put` method to resolve with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").fail(function (error) {
    closed.resolve(error);
    throw error;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `get` method to resolve with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").fail(function (error) {
    closed.resolve(error);
    throw error;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the `put` method to resolve with a different value.

DONE.
