  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'write_close'` is emitted when the write stream is closed, but `'drain'` is emitted when the write stream is drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'read_close'` is emitted when the read stream is closed, but `'drain'` is emitted when the write stream is drained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'error'` is emitted when an error occurs, but `'drain'` is emitted when the write stream is drained.

DONE.
