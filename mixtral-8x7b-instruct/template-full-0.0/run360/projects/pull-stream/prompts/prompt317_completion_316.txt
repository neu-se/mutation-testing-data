 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `true` as the error parameter to the callback, even if an error occurred. The original code only calls the callback with an error if one is passed from the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
