  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `rest` except the first one, whereas `rest` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(0, -1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `rest` except the last one, whereas `rest` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.splice(0, 1)` would remove the first element of `rest` and return a new array containing the removed element, whereas `rest` would return the original array.

DONE.
