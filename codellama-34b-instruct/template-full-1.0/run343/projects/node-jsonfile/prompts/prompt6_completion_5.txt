  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(stripBom)(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
