  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr()` method is used to get or set the value of an attribute, while the original fragment only gets the attribute without calling the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop()` method is used to get or set a property, while the original fragment only gets the property without calling the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').css()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `css()` method is used to get or set the CSS styles of an element, while the original fragment only gets the `href` attribute of the `base` tag.

DONE.
