  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the protocol with "https" instead of "http", which could cause issues if the URL does not support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the protocol with "ftp" instead of "http", which could cause issues if the URL does not support FTP.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the protocol with "file" instead of "http", which could cause issues if the URL does not support the file protocol.

DONE.
