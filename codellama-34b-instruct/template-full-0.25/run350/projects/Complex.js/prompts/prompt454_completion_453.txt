  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `isNaN` method, causing the `toString` method to return a string representation of the complex number even if it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method to return a string representation of the complex number even if it is not finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `toString` method to return a string representation of the complex number even if it is not infinite.

DONE.
