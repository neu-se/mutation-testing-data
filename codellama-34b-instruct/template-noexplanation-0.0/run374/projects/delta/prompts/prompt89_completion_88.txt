  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `newOp.attributes` is not `null`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `newOp.attributes` is `undefined`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== {}
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `newOp.attributes` is not an empty object, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
