 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bootstrap` function would not be called in environments other than Montage Require.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bootstrap` function would be called unconditionally, which could lead to unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to `false`, and the `bootstrap` function would never be called.

DONE.
