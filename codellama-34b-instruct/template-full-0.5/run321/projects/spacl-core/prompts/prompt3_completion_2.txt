  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the match to be global, meaning that it would match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the
