  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` to calculate the power of 10, but the new code fragment uses `Math.pow(10, places || 1)` which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` to calculate the power of 10, but the new code fragment uses `Math.pow(10, places || 1)` which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.pow(10, places || 0
