  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` would remove characters from the right side of the string, whereas `trimLeft` removes characters from the left side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the string to lowercase, whereas `trimLeft` would remove characters from the left side.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would return a substring starting from the second character, whereas `trimLeft` would remove characters from the left side.

DONE.
