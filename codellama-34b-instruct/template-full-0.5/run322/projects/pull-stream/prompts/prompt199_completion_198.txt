  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` as the first argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior. By replacing it with `null`, the `read` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would not cause any errors but may result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the `read` function to be called with `abort` as the first argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior. By replacing it with `undefined`, the `read` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would not cause any errors but may result in different behavior depending on the implementation of the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
