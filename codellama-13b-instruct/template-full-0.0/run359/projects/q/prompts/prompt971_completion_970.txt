  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `args` array, while the new code fragment is an empty array. This would cause the function to return an empty array instead of the original `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `args` array, while the new code fragment is `undefined`. This would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the original `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `args` array, while the new code fragment is `null`. This would cause the function to return `null` instead of the original `args` array.

DONE.
