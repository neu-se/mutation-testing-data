  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the second element of the array instead of the first, potentially skipping over important data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This change will cause the loop to start at the last element of the array instead of the first, potentially skipping over important data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * tokens.length)
```
This change will cause the loop to start at a random element of the array, potentially skipping over important data.

DONE.
