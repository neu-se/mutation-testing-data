  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the loop to skip every other promise in the array, potentially causing the `race` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the loop to resolve twice as many promises as it should, potentially causing the `race` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs[i] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the loop to resolve one fewer promise than it should, potentially causing the `race` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
