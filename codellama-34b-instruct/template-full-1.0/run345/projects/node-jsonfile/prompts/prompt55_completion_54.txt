  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument would be passed to `JSON.stringify`, which could cause it to fail or generate unexpected output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `''` (empty string) argument would be passed to `JSON.stringify`, which could cause it to fail or generate unexpected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces, 42
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `42` (integer) argument would be passed to `JSON.stringify`, which could cause it to fail or generate unexpected output.

DONE.
