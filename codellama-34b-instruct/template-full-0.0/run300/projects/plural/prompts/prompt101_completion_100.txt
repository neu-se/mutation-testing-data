  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/a/` matches any character, not just the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/g, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression makes it match all occurrences of the letter "a", not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/i, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag at the end of the regular expression makes it case-insensitive, so it would match both "a" and "A".

DONE.
