  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `.reject()` will be called instead of `.resolve()`, which will cause an error to be thrown when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.isResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `.isResolved()` will be called instead of `.resolve()`, which will return a boolean value indicating whether the promise has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.then(function() { throw new Error("Error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then()` will be called instead of `.resolve()`, which will schedule the function to be executed when the promise is resolved. The function will throw an error, which will be caught by the promise's error handler.

DONE.
