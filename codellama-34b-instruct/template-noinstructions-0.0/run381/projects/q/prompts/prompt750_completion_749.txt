  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the pending count is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the pending count is less than 0. This would cause the `all` function to behave differently when the pending count is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the pending count is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the pending count is greater than 0. This would cause the `all` function to behave differently when the pending count is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the pending count is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the pending count is equal to 1. This would cause the `all` function to behave differently when the pending count is 1.
