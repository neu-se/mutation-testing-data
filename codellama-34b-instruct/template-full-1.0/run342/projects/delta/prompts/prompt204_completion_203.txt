  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest` refers to the remaining portion of the `other` Delta object after the first op, while `other.ops` refers to the entire Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest` refers to the remaining portion of the Delta object after the first op, while `length` returns the total length of the Delta object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest` refers to the remaining portion of the `other` Delta object after the first op, while `length` returns the total length of the `other` Delta object.

DONE.
