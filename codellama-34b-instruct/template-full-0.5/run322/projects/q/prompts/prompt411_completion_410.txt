  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value === value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the fulfillment value is equal to the original value, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value !== value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the fulfillment value is not equal to the original value, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
