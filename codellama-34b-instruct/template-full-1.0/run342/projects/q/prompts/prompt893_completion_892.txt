  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `callback` is a function that is called with the given arguments, and the return value is a promise for the resolution of the given promise after some milliseconds. However, if we replace it with `null`, the function will throw an error when it tries to call `null` as a function, which will cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `callback` is a function that is called with the given arguments, and the return value is a promise for the resolution of the given promise after some milliseconds. However, if we replace it with `undefined`, the function will throw an error when it tries to call `undefined` as a function, which will cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "foo"; }
```
This would result in different behavior
