Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method converts the slug to uppercase, whereas the original code converts it to a specific case defined by `config.filename_case`, potentially leading to different slug values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slug + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'test' to the slug, changing its value and potentially affecting the functionality of the `slugize` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.title.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `title` property instead of the `slug` property, potentially leading to different input for the `slugize` function and affecting the resulting slug value.

DONE.
