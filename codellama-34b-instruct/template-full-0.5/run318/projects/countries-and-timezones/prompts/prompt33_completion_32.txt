  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the hour component of the offset, which could cause the offset to be outside the valid range of -12 to 12.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 12
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 12 to the hour component of the offset, which could cause the offset to be outside the valid range of -12 to 12.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) - 12
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 12 from the hour component of the offset, which could cause the offset to be outside the valid range of -12 to 12.

DONE.
