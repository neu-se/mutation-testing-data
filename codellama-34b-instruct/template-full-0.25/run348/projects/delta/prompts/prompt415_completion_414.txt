  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` returns the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

DONE.
