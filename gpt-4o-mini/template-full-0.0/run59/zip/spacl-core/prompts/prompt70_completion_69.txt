Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/' + path
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the path being queried by prepending a forward slash, which may lead to different rule matches than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the path, potentially causing the query to fail to match any existing rules that do not account for this modification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the path with `null`, which would likely cause all rules to return `null` or fail to match, leading to a situation where the policy does not evaluate the rules correctly.

DONE.
