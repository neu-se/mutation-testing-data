  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `ops` array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `ops` array instead of the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the `ops` array except the first one.

DONE.
