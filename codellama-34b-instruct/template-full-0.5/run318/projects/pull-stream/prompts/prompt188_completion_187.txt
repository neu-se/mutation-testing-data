  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in the opposite direction, and the `i` variable would be decremented instead of incremented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over the first element of the `array` and start at the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every other element of the `array`, effectively skipping over every other element.

DONE.
