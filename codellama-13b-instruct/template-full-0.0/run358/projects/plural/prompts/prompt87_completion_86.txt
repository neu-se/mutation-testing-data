  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "person" when the number of items is 1, while the new code fragment returns the string "people" regardless of the number of items.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "people" when the number of items is greater than 1, while the new code fragment returns the string "person" regardless of the number of items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person' + num
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "person" when the number of items is 1, while the new code fragment returns the string "person" concatenated with the number of items.

DONE.
