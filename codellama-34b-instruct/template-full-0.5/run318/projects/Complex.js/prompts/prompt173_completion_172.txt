  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned `Complex['ZERO']` for this case, while the new code would return `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned `Complex['ZERO']` for this case, while the new code would return `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ONE'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned `Complex['ZERO']` for this case, while the new code would return `Complex['ONE']`.

DONE.
