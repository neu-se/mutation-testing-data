  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to decrement the index instead of incrementing it, which would result in the loop body being executed fewer times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip every other iteration, which would result in the loop body being executed fewer times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to restart from the beginning, which would result in the loop body being executed more times.

DONE.
