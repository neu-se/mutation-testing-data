  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the nextOp onto the ops array, but replacing it with null would push null onto the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the nextOp onto the ops array, but replacing it with undefined would push undefined onto the ops array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push the nextOp onto the ops array, but replacing it with 0 would push 0 onto the ops array.

DONE.
