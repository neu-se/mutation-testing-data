  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method binds the `this` context to the first argument, whereas the `apply` method does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects an array of arguments, and passing `[args]` would result in an array of arrays, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method expects two arguments: the `this` context and an array of arguments. Omitting the `this` context would result in the method being applied to the global object, which may not have the desired behavior.

DONE.
