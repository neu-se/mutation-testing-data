 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the literal string `\n` instead of a newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\n/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the literal string `\n` instead of a newline character, and the backslash needs to be escaped in the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace both newline characters (`\n` and `\r`) instead of just `\n`.

DONE.
