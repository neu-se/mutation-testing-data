  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which would change the result of the `sinh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `a`, which would also change the result of the `sinh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, which would change the result of the `sinh` function.

DONE.
