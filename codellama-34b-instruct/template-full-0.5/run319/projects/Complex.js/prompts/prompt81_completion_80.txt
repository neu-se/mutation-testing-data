  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`, while this replacement checks if it is not equal. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`, while this replacement checks if it is equal to `'+'`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is equal to `'-'`, while this replacement checks if it is equal to `'*'`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain cases.

DONE.
