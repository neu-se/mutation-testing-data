  MUTATION TESTING RESULTS:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, but this new code checks if `acc` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? acc : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, but this new code checks if `acc` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true` or `false`, but this new code checks if `end` is `false` or `null`.

DONE.
