  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns instead of newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns and newlines instead of just newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace one or more carriage returns and newlines instead of just newlines.

DONE.
