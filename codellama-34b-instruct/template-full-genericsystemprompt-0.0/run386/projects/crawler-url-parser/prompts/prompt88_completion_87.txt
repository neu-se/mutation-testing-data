  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the text, rather than the entire text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text in all uppercase letters, rather than the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all letters from the text, rather than returning the entire text.

DONE.
