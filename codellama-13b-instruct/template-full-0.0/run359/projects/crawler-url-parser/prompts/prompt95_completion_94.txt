  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrl` object is not a string, but an object with properties such as `url`, `protocol`, `host`, etc. Using `baseUrl.url` would access the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, which is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the current scope, and using `null` would cause the `baseUrl` object to be undefined. This would likely cause errors in the code that relies on the `baseUrl` object being defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is not defined in the current scope, and using `undefined` would cause the `baseUrl` object to be undefined. This would likely cause errors in the code that relies on the `
