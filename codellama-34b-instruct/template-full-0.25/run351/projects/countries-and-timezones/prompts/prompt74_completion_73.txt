  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `name` is a string, and adding the string "foo" to it would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `name` is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `name` is a string, and getting the length of the string would result in a different number.

DONE.
