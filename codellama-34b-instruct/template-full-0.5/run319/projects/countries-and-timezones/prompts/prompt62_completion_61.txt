  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `id + 1` would return a different value than `id`, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `id * 2` would return a different value than `id`, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `id - 1` would return a different value than `id`, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

DONE.
