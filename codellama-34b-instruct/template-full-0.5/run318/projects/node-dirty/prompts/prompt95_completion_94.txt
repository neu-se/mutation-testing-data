  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the input string into an array of substrings, rather than returning the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the input string to uppercase, rather than returning the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the input string, rather than the string itself.

DONE.
