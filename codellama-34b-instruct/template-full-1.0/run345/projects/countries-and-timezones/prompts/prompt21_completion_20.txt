  Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the original code with buggy code fragments that have different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Number.isInteger(offset))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, causing the `dstOffset` calculation to always equal `utcOffset`, regardless of the value of `offset`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Number.isNaN(offset))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, causing the `dstOffset` calculation to never equal `utcOffset`, regardless of the value of `offset`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(offset % 2 === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dstOffset` calculation to only equal `utcOffset` when `offset` is even, and to be different when `offset` is odd.

DONE.
