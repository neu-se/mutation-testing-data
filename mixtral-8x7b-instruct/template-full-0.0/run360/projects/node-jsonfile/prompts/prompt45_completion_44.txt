 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the second argument to `stringify`, which could cause unexpected results or errors if the `stringify` function relies on the `obj` argument being provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, 'incorrect-encoding'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an incorrect encoding string to `fs.writeFileSync`, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, { reviver: 'incorrect-reviver' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an incorrect reviver function to `JSON.parse`, which could cause the function to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

DONE.
