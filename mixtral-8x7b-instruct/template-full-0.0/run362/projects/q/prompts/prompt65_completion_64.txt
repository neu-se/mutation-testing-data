 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function is not called, and the `setImmediate` callback will not throw any exceptions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'flush'
