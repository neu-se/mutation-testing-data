  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because `object instanceof Array` would return `false` for arrays, while `object` would return `true` for arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object === "boolean"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof object === "boolean"` would return `true` for booleans, while `object` would return `true` for any non-null object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.length > 0` would return `true` for empty arrays, while `object` would return `false` for empty arrays.

DONE.
