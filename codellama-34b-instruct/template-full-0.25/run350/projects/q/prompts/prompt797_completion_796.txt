  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and will not have the same properties and methods as `void 0`, which is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and will not have the same properties and methods as `void 0`, which is a special value that represents the absence of a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a special value that represents the absence of a value, and will not have the same properties and methods as `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
