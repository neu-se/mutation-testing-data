  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable, which cannot be reassigned. In the original code, the `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the `policies` array, and the `policy` variable is reassigned on each iteration. Replacing the `const` keyword with `let` or `var` would allow the `policy` variable to be reassigned, which could potentially cause the loop to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let policy of policies) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned. In the original code, the `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the `policies` array, and the `policy` variable is reassigned on each iteration. Replacing the `const` keyword with `let` would allow the `policy` variable to
