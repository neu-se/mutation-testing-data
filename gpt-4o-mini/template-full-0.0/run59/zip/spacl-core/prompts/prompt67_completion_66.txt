Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the iteration to only the first rule in the `rules` array, potentially ignoring other rules that may allow or deny the action.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the rules, which may change the outcome of the query if the rules are ordered in a specific way that affects the decision-making process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.isActive)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers rules that are active (assuming `isActive` is a property of `Rule`), potentially ignoring inactive rules that may have allowed or denied the action.

DONE.
