Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.trimRight()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.trimRight()` removes whitespace from the end of the string instead of the beginning, which could lead to incorrect URL handling if the URL has leading whitespace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the URL to lowercase could cause issues with case-sensitive URLs, potentially leading to incorrect requests being made.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.replace('http', 'ftp')
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing 'http' with 'ftp' would change the protocol used for the request, which is not valid for HTTP requests and would likely result in an error.

DONE.
