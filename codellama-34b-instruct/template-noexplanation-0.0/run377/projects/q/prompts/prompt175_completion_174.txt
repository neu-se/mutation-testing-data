  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This code fragment will reverse the order of the desired lines before joining them, which will result in a different stack trace than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This code fragment will remove the first element of the desired lines array before joining them, which will result in a different stack trace than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["<new line>"]).join
```
This code fragment will add a new line to the desired lines array before joining them, which will result in a different stack trace than the original code.

DONE.
