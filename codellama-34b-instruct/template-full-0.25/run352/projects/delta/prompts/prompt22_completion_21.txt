  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isEqual` is the negation of `isEqual`, so it would return `true` if the two values are not equal, and `false` if they are equal. This would cause the `diff` function to return a different result than it would with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of the two objects directly, rather than using the `isEqual` function to check for deep equality. This would cause the `diff` function to return a different result than it would with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key] && a[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the values of the two objects are not equal and the value in `a` is not `
