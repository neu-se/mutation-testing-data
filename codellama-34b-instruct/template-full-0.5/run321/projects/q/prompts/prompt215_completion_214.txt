  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the promise would be incremented by 1, which would change the resolution value and potentially cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the promise would be doubled, which would change the resolution value and potentially cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the promise would be decremented by 1, which would change the resolution value and potentially cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
