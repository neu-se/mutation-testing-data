  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` property is only present in the `Q.reject` method, whereas the `done` property is only present in the `Q.resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` method is only present in the `Q.reject` method, whereas the `isResolved` method is only present in the `Q.resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` method is only present in the `Q.pending` method, whereas the `isResolved` and `isRejected` methods are only present in the `Q.resolve` and `Q.reject` methods, respectively.

DONE.
