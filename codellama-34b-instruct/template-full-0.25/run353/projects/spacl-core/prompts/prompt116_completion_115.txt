  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator checks for the presence of a property in an object, while the `of` operator iterates over the values of an object. In this case, the `in` operator would cause the loop to iterate over the properties of the `verbs` object, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values in an object, rather than the object itself. In this case, the loop would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the `verbs` object, rather
