  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the reason of the next unhandled rejection, instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the reason of the previous unhandled rejection, instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
randomVariable
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a completely unrelated variable, which would likely produce a syntax error or cause other issues.

DONE.
