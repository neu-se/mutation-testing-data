  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(promises, function (promises) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is not a function that returns a promise, but rather a function that resolves the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(promises, function (promises) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is not a function that returns a promise, but rather a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.defer(promises, function (promises) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is not a function that returns a promise, but rather a function that returns a deferred object.

DONE.
