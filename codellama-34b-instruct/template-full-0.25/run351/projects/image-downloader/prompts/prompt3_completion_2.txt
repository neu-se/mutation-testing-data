  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, and the code that handles the error may not be able to handle this new error message correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is not a valid URL')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, and the code that handles the error may not be able to handle this new error message correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a valid file path')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, and the code that handles the error may not be able to handle this new error message correctly.

DONE.
