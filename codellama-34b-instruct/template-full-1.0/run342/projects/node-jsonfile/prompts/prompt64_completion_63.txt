  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf-16'
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON string would be encoded using UTF-16 rather than UTF-8. This could cause issues with the string being correctly parsed or manipulated later in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'utf-32'
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON string would be encoded using UTF-32 rather than UTF-8. This could cause issues with the string being correctly parsed or manipulated later in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON string would be encoded using ASCII rather than UTF-8. This could cause issues with the string being correctly parsed or manipulated later in the program, especially if the string contains non-ASCII characters.

DONE.
