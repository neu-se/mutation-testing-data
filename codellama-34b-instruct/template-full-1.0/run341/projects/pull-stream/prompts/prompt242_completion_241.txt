  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the boolean value of `data`, potentially creating a false positive in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `data` value, potentially creating a false positive in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the `data` value, potentially creating a false positive in the test suite.

DONE.
