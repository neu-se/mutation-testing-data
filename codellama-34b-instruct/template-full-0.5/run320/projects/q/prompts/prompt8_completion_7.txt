  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the previous value of `global.Q` with the new value, potentially causing issues with other code that relies on the previous value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `previousQ` to an empty object if `global.Q` is not defined, which could cause issues if other code relies on the previous value of `global.Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q || null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `previousQ` to `null` if `global.Q` is not defined, which could cause issues if other code relies on the previous value of `global.Q`.

DONE.
