  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `clearTimeout` method, so calling `clearTimeout(null)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `clearTimeout` method, so calling `clearTimeout(undefined)` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a primitive value that does not have a `clearTimeout` method, so calling `clearTimeout(0)` would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
