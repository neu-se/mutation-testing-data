  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `onUnhandledError` would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown when the `then` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new function would be created and passed as a callback to the `then` method, rather than the original `onUnhandledError` function.

DONE.
