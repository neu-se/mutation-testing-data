  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the second argument, which is an options object that can modify the behavior of the `glob` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { ignore: ['**/node_modules/**'] })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an `ignore` option in the options object, which would cause the `glob` method to ignore any files or directories that match the specified pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(globPart, { cwd: '/' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include a `cwd` option in the options object, which would cause the `glob` method to search for files or directories in the root directory instead of the current working directory.

DONE.
