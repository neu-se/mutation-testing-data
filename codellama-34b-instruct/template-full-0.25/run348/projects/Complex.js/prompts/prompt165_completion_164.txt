  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this['isInfinite']`, so if the original code fragment evaluated to `true`, the mutated code fragment would evaluate to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` checks if the number is finite, whereas `this['isInfinite']` checks if the number is infinite. If the original code fragment evaluated to `true`, the mutated code fragment would evaluate to `false` if the number is finite, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` checks if the number is not a number (NaN), whereas `this['isInfinite']` checks if the number is infinite. If
