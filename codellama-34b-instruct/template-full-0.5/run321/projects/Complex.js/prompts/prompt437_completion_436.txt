  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `1` instead of `0` if `places` is `undefined`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would always return `0` instead of `1` if `places` is `undefined`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would always return `1` instead of `0` if `places` is `undefined`, which would cause the `Math.pow` function to return a different value.

DONE.
