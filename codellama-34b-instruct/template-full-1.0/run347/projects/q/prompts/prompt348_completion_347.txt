  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Exception())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `reject()`, while this replacement calls `reject()` with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `reject()`, while this replacement calls `reject()` with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `reject()`, while this replacement throws an exception instead.

DONE.
