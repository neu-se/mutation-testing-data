  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `games` and `illnesses` arrays, resulting in a new array that contains all the elements of both arrays. In contrast, the original code fragment only concatenates the `games` array with the `illnesses` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses).slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `games` and `illnesses` arrays, and then remove the last element of the resulting array. In contrast, the original code fragment only concatenates the `games` array with the `illnesses` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses).filter(function(word) { return word.length > 3 })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concaten
