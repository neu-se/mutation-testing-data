 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `fs.writeFileSync` would be ignored, always returning `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the options object as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`, which might not be expected by the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the third argument to `fs.writeFileSync`, ignoring any value that might have been provided in the `options` object.

DONE.
