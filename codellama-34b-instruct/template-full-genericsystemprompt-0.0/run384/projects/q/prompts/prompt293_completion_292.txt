  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.resolve, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments to be in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, deferred.resolve, deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different, which could cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments to be in a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.notify, deferred.resolve

DONE.
