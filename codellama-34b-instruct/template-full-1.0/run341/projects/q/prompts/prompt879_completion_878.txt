  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` is a reference to the `reject` method on the current object, which is not the same as the `reject` method on the `deferred` object. Using `this.reject` would cause the `nfapply` method to call the wrong `reject` method and potentially cause unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a reference to the `resolve` method on the `deferred` object, which is not the same as the `reject` method. Using `deferred.resolve` would cause the `nfapply` method to call the wrong method and potentially cause unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because using a function that throws
