  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled.then(function (results) {
    return results.filter(function (result) {
        return result.state === "fulfilled";
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the results to only include fulfilled promises, whereas the original code fragment does not filter the results.
