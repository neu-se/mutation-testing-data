  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks whether `a` is greater than zero. This change would cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks whether `b` is not equal to zero. This change would cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to zero, while this new code
