  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.path` would be undefined, and `linkurl.pathname` would be the pathname of the URL, which could be different from the path of the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.search` would be the search query of the URL, which could be different from the path of the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.hash` would be the hash of the URL, which could be different from the path of the base URL.

DONE.
