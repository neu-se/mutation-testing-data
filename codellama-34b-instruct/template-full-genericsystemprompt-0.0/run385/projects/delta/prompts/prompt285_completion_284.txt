  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `index` variable to be off by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the `index` variable to be off by -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the `index` variable to be off by a factor of 2.

DONE.
