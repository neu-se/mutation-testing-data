Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.toString(), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `data` variable, which could potentially alter its value if it's not already a string, leading to different parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options ? options.reviver : null` part is removed, which means the `reviver` function will always be used, even if it's not provided in the `options` object, potentially causing errors if it's not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.slice(1), options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method is called on the `data` variable, which removes the first character of the string, potentially causing the JSON parsing to fail or produce different results.

DONE.
