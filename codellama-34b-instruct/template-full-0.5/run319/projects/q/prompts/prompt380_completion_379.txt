  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, which would cause the `tap` method to be called with the rejection reason, rather than the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a resolved promise, which would cause the `tap` method to be called with `undefined`, rather than the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a deferred promise, which would cause the `tap` method to be called with a pending promise, rather than the fulfilled value.

DONE.
