  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called instead of `invert`, which would alter the mutation testing in this code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called instead of `invert`, which would alter the mutation testing in this code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method is called instead of `invert`, which would alter the mutation testing in this code.

DONE.
