  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && Math.random() < 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random factor to the condition, making it possible for the code to take a different branch even if `flushing` is not true.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!flushing || Math.random() < 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it makes the condition more likely to be true, even if `flushing` is already false.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && !Math.random() < 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition and makes it always false, even if `flushing` is true.

DONE.
