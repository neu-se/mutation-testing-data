  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the `index` from `start`, which would result in a negative value if `index` is greater than `start`. However, adding `index` to `start` would result in a positive value, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the `index` from `start`, which would result in a negative value if `index` is greater than `start`. However, multiplying `start` by `index` would result in a larger negative value, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is subtracting the `index` from `start`, which would result in a negative value if `index` is greater than `start`. However,
