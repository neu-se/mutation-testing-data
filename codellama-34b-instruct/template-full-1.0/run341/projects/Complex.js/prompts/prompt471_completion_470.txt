  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to 0 instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is not equal to 0 instead of equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the equality operator instead of the identity operator. It may result in a different value being returned if the imaginary part is not strictly equal to 0.

DONE.
