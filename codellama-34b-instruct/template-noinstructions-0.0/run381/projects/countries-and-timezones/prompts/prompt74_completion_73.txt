  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive an invalid timezone name, which would cause it to return `null` instead of a valid timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a valid timezone name, but the `memoizeTimezone` function would not be called, as the `timezones` object would already contain the `UTC` timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"America/New_York"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would receive a valid timezone name, but the `memoizeTimezone` function would not be called, as the `timezones` object would already contain the `America/New_York` timezone.

DONE.
