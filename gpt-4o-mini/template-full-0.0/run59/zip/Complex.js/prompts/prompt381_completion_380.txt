Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the hyperbolic cosine of `a` to using the hyperbolic sine of `b`, which will yield different results for the complex function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the hyperbolic cosine function with the regular sine function, which will produce a different output for the complex calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation to use the cosine of the sum of `a` and `b`, which is not equivalent to the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and will lead to incorrect results in the context of complex functions.

DONE.
