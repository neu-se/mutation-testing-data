  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined`. This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `end` parameter, and the function would not return a value as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`. This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `end` parameter, but the function would not return the expected values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `true`. This would result in different behavior because `true` is a valid value for the `end` parameter, but the function would not return the expected values.

DONE.
