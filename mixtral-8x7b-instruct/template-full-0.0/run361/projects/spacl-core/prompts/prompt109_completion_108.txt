 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'/', ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `path` parameter with a constant string, causing the `matches` method to always return `policy.matches('/')` instead of checking the provided path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
path, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `ctx` parameter with `undefined`, causing the `matches` method to behave differently when a context is required but not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.get('another_policy').matches(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `path` matches another policy ('another_policy') instead of the intended one (`name`). This could lead to unexpected results when querying policies.

DONE.
