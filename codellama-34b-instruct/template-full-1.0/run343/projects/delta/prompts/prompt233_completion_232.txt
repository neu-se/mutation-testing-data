  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, thisOp.retain - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment was using `thisOp.retain` which is the number of characters to retain in the current op, but by replacing it with `this.ops.slice(0, thisOp.retain - 1)` we are now slicing the `this.ops` array from the beginning to `thisOp.retain - 1` which is a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisOp.retain, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the previous code fragment was using `thisOp.retain` which is the number of characters to retain in the current op, but by replacing it with `this.ops.slice(thisOp.retain, this.ops.length)` we are now slicing the `this.ops` array from `thisOp.retain` to the end
