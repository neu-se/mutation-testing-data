  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transformation to occur in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `thisData` and `otherData` parameters is swapped, which would cause the transformation to occur in the opposite order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is not negated, which would cause the transformation to occur in the same order as the original code.

DONE.
