  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"newKey"
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being used to store the value in the `_queue` map is now a hardcoded string `"newKey"`, instead of the original key being used. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original key being used to retrieve the value from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "suffix"
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being used to store the value in the `_queue` map is now a concatenation of the original key and a hardcoded string `"suffix"`. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original key being used to retrieve the value from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the key being used to store the value in the `_queue` map is now `null`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original key being
