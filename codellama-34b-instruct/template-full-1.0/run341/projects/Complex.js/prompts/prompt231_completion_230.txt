  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of a complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` in the calculation of the complex square root could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + a` is a different expression than `b`. Using `b + a` instead of `b` in the calculation of the complex square root could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is a different expression than `b`. Using `a - b` instead of `b` in the calculation of the complex square root could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

DONE.
