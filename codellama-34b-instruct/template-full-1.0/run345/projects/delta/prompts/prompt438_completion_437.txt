  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a specific type of retain (i.e. number) while the mutated code checks for any type of retain (i.e. object or type).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a specific type of retain (i.e. number or object) while the mutated code checks for a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'TypeError'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a specific type of retain (i.e. number or object) while the mutated code checks for a TypeError.

DONE.
