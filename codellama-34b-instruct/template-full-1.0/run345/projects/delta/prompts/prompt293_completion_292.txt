  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the current operation to the `line` Delta, while replacing it with `delete` would pop it instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the current operation to the `line` Delta, while replacing it with `insert` would insert a new operation at the beginning of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushes the current operation to the `line` Delta, while replacing it with `retain` would remove the current operation from the delta.

DONE.
