 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object would not be initialized, and the returned promise would not be linked to any execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be assigned to `deferred`, which does not have the necessary methods (`resolve`, `reject`, `notify`) to properly handle the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{promise: null, resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {}, notify: function() {}}
