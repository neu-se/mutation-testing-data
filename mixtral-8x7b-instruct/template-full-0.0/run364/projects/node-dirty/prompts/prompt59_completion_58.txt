 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would no longer close file streams, causing potential resource leaks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => this._readStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would only close the read stream, leaving the write stream open.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.close = () => this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would only close the write stream, leaving the read stream open.

DONE.
