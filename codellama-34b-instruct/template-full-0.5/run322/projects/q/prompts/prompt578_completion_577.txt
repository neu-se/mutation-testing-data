  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `this` context of the `continuer` function to `continuer` itself, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `this` context of the `continuer` function to `null`, which would cause the function to throw an error when it tries to access properties on `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `this` context of the `continuer` function to `undefined`, which would cause the function to throw an error when it tries to access properties on `this`.

DONE.
