 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the division by `this['re']` could cause a division by zero error, while the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` or `Complex['ZERO']` depending on the other values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison would always return a boolean value, while the original code checks for infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific value of infinity, while the original code checks for any kind of infinity.

DONE.
