  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the 'close' event is emitted when the write stream is closed. In this case, the 'close' event would be emitted when the write stream is closed, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the 'error' event is emitted when an error occurs. In this case, the 'error' event would be emitted when an error occurs, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is drained, while the 'finish' event is emitted when the write stream
