Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('warning', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'warning' event instead of an 'error' event, which may not be handled by the same listeners and could lead to unreported issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a load event with a value of -1 instead of the actual size of the data, which could mislead any listeners expecting the correct size of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`), 'extra info');
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument ('extra info') to the emitted error event, which may cause issues if listeners are not designed to handle more than one argument.

DONE.
