  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is not a function, which would cause an error to be thrown and the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.fail;
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is not a function, which would cause an error to be thrown and the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.then;
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.then` is not the same as `deferred.reject`, which means that even if the promise is rejected, it would not be handled by the `deferred.then` method.

DONE.
