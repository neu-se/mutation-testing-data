Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the existence of a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', which could lead to incorrect handling of configuration files that use the 'extends' property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig, 'extends'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking the 'defaultConfig' object for the 'extends' property instead of the 'config' object, which could lead to incorrect handling of configuration files that use the 'extends' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config, 'extends' && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now always checking the 'extends' property of the 'config' object, regardless of its actual existence, due to the short-circuiting behavior of the '&&' operator, which could lead to incorrect handling of configuration files that do not use the 'extends' property.

DONE.
