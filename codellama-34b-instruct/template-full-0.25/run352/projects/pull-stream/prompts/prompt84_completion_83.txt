  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function expects a truthy value as its first argument, but `null` is falsy. This would cause the `read` function to exit early, without reading any data from the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function expects a truthy value as its first argument, but `undefined` is falsy. This would cause the `read` function to exit early, without reading any data from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function expects a truthy value as its first argument, but `false` is falsy. This would cause the `read` function to exit early, without reading any data from the stream.

DONE.
