  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest)).
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream for every chunk of the response, instead of reusing the same stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(null)).
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream with a null filename, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest + '.tmp')).
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new write stream with a different filename, which would cause the file to be written to a different location.

DONE.
