  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options
```
This would result in different behavior because `!options` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options` is a non-empty string. In contrast, `typeof options === 'string'` would only evaluate to `true` if `options` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `options == null` would only evaluate to `true` if `options` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas `typeof options === 'string'` would evaluate to `true` for any non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'something'
```
This would result in different behavior because `options === 'something'` would only evaluate to `true` if `options` is the string `'something'`, whereas `typeof options === 'string'` would evaluate to `true` for any non-empty string.

DONE.
