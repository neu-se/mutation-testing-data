  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush.bind(null)` is a bound function that returns a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, whereas `flush` is a function that is called with the default `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick.bind(null)` is a bound function that returns a new function with the `this` value bound to `null`, whereas `requestTick` is a function that is called with the default `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(flush, 0)` calls `flush` asynchronously after a delay of 0 milliseconds, whereas `flush` is called synchronously.

DONE.
