  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rounds down to the nearest hour, while this code rounds up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rounds down to the nearest hour, while this code rounds up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rounds down to the nearest hour, while this code rounds to the nearest hour.

DONE.
