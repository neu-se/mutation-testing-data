  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is true if the operation is a retain operation, while `otherOp.delete` is true if the operation is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherOp.delete` is true if the operation is not a delete operation, while `otherOp.retain` is true if the operation is a retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is the attributes of the operation, while `otherOp.retain` is true if the operation is a retain operation.

DONE.
