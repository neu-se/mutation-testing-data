  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the result of the `Math.pow` function to be off by one, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the result of the `Math.pow` function to be off by one, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the result of the `Math.pow` function to be double the original value, which would lead to an incorrect calculation of the tile coordinates.

DONE.
