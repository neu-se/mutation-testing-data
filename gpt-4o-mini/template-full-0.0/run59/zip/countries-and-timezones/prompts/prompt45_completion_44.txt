Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a valid `id` would cause `getCountry` to attempt to memoize a country with a `null` identifier, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a string like `'unknown'` instead of the actual `id` would cause `getCountry` to look for a country with that identifier, which likely does not exist, resulting in a failure to retrieve the correct country data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because appending `'1'` to the `id` would change the identifier being used to retrieve the country, leading to a different country being fetched or potentially causing a failure if the modified identifier does not exist.

DONE.
