  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a built-in JavaScript object, and `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a particular class. In this case, `this` is not an instance of `Number`, so the condition would evaluate to `false`, even if `this` is a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor === Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the function that created the object. In this case, the `constructor` of a complex number is not `Number`, so the condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.name === 'Number'
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a property of a function that refers to the name of the function. In this case, the `name` of the `constructor` of a complex number is not
