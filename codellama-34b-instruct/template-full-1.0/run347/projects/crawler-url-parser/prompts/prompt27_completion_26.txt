  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string `currentUrlStr` does not start with the substring `'http'`, instead of checking if it starts with a URL scheme like `http` or `https`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr.includes(':')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string `currentUrlStr` does not contain the character `':'` anywhere in the string, instead of checking if the string starts with a URL scheme.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace('http', 'ftp')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the string `'http'` with `'ftp'` in the `currentUrlStr` string, which would make the `URL.parse()` function interpret the string as a different URL protocol.

DONE.
