  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Policy(name, ...this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(null)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return new Policy(name, ...this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)));`, which would clone the underlying rules with a specified placeholder, but the new code fragment would clone the underlying rules with a `null` placeholder, which could potentially result in different behavior if the `clone` method relies on the placeholder for its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Policy(name, ...this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(false)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `return new Policy(name, ...this.rules.map((rule) => rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)));`, which would clone the underlying rules with a specified placeholder, but the new code fragment would clone the underlying rules with a `false` placeholder
