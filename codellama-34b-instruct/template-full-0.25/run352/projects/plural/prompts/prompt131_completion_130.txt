  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any regular expression `rule[0]`, regardless of whether it matches the input word or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any regular expression `rule[0]`, regardless of whether it matches the input word or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any regular expression `rule[0]`, regardless of whether it matches the input word or not.

DONE.
