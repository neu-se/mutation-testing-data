  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
absoluteUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` returns an object with properties like `href`, `pathname`, `hostname`, etc. By calling `URL.format()` on the object returned by `URL.parse()`, we get the original URL string, while calling `URL.format()` on the `href` property of the object would return a different URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
absoluteUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `absoluteUrl.pathname` returns the pathname of the URL, without the protocol or hostname. By using `URL.format()` on `absoluteUrl.pathname`, we would get a URL string that only includes the pathname, while using `URL.format()` on the original `absoluteUrl` object would include the protocol and hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
absoluteUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `absoluteUrl.search
