  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q().spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` method to be called on an empty promise, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(fulfilled).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` method to be called on a promise that is already fulfilled with the value `fulfilled`, which would result in the fulfilled value being spread into an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(rejected).spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` method to be called on a promise that is already rejected with the reason `rejected`, which would result in the rejection being propagated to the next promise in the chain.

DONE.
