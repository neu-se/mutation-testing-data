  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(x => x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be applied to the stream, causing the values to be incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(x => x > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function would be applied to the stream, causing only positive values to be included in the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` function would be applied to the stream, causing the values to be summed up and the result to be returned.

DONE.
