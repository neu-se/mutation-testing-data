  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` and `phi` are different object properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` and `a` are different variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 changes the value of the expression.

DONE.
