  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds towards negative infinity, while `Math.round()` rounds towards zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds towards positive infinity, while `Math.round()` rounds towards zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer.

DONE.
