  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a positive lookahead assertion to ensure that the path does not end with a slash, while the new code fragment uses a negative lookahead assertion to ensure that the path does not end with a slash. The negative lookahead assertion will match any string that does not end with a slash, while the positive lookahead assertion will only match strings that end with a slash.

DONE.
