  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise, and `result.value` would return the resolved value of the promise, whereas `result` alone would return the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.then()` would return a new promise that resolves to the value of the original promise, whereas `result` alone would return the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.catch(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.catch()` would return a new promise that rejects with the error of the original promise, whereas `result` alone would return the original promise.

DONE.
