  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `NaN`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Infinity`, regardless of the input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0`, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
