  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator (`*`) is different from the addition operator (`+`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator (`-`) is different from the addition operator (`+`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator (`/`) is different from the addition operator (`+`).

DONE.
