Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only escape a single '$' character instead of two, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$' + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the `targetPath` to the escaped '$' characters, potentially resulting in an incorrect path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not escape the '$' character at all, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements or errors if the `targetPath` contains '$' characters.

DONE.
