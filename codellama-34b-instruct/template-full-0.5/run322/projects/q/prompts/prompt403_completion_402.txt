  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q(promise).thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a resolved promise, whereas `Q(promise).thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the specified promise or immediate value, whereas `Q(promise).thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason.

DONE.
