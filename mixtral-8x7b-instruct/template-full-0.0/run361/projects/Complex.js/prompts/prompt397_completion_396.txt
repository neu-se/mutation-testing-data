 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` is a static method and does not have access to the instance properties `this.re` and `this.im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(this.re) + Math.asin(this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the asin of the real and imaginary parts separately, instead of applying the asin to the complex number as a whole.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(this.re + this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the real and imaginary parts before applying the asin, instead of treating them as separate components of a complex number.

DONE.
