  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` are different functions, and would produce different results for the final computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re']` is a real part of a complex number, while `Math.sin` expects a real number as its argument. The result of the computation would be different, and potentially incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex.prototype.sin` is a method of the `Complex` class, and it expects a `Complex` object as its argument. The result of the computation would be different, and potentially incorrect.

DONE.
