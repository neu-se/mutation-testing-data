  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is NaN, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is the imaginary part of the complex number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is the real part of the complex number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is Infinity.

DONE.
