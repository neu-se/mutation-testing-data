  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "valueOf".
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the original Promise object, never the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "toSource".
```
Q.toSource();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the Promise object, but it would not return the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "valueOf()[0]".
```
Q.valueOf()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the resolved value, but if the resolved value is not an array, it would throw an error.

DONE.
