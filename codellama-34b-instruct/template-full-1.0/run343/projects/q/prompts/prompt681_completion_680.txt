  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first argument (i.e., `object`) in the arguments passed to the `apply` method, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [array_slice(arguments, 1)]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a nested array containing the `arguments` instead of the `arguments` themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments (`object` and `name`) instead of just skipping the first argument.

DONE.
