  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `abort` variable, potentially causing the `abortCb` function to be called when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of the `abort` variable, potentially causing the `abortCb` function to be called with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` assignment operator would set the `abort` variable to `null`, potentially causing the `abortCb` function to be called with an incorrect value.

DONE.
