 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defineProperty` method is being replaced with `bind`, which is used to create a new function with its `this` value set to a specified object and optional pre-filled arguments. This change will prevent the code from defining properties correctly on the Complex object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defineProperty` method is being replaced with `Math.sqrt`, which calculates the square root of a number. This change will cause an error since the `defineProperty` method is not a number, and `Math.sqrt` is not a valid replacement for defining properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.push
