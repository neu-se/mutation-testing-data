  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.relative` returns the relative path from one file to another, whereas `path.resolve` returns the absolute path of a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, whereas `path.resolve` returns the absolute path of a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.resolve` returns the absolute path of a file.

DONE.
