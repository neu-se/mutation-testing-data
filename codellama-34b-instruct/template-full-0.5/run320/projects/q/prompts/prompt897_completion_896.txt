  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` is not defined in the original code, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid arguments"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not check for invalid arguments, so it would not reject the promise with the provided error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Invalid arguments"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use notifications, so it would not notify the promise with the provided error message.

DONE.
