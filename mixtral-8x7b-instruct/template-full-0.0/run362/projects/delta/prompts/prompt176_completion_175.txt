 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be larger than the actual length of the operation, potentially causing the diff algorithm to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be based on the length of the next operation in the `other` delta, rather than the length of the next operation in the current delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `length` variable to be based on the maximum length of the next operation in either delta, rather than the length of the next operation in the current delta.

DONE.
