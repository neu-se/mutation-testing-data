  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).bind(undefined).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind(undefined)` would change the value of `this` inside the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.fapply(null)` would pass `null` as the `this` value to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `.fapply([])` would pass an empty array as the `this` value to the callback.

DONE.
