  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `y`, which is used in the calculation of `λ2`. This would cause the resulting `λ2` value to be different from the original calculation, which could lead to a different destination point being calculated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `y`, which is used in the calculation of `λ2`. This would cause the resulting `λ2` value to be different from the original calculation, which could lead to a different destination point being calculated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `y`, which is used in the calculation of `λ2`. This would cause the resulting `λ2` value to be different from the original calculation, which could lead to a different destination
