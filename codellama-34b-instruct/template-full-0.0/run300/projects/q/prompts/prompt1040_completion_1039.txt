  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object, while `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise object. In the original code, the `put` method resolves the `ends` deferred object with a new object that contains the `head` and `tail` properties. However, if we replace `Q.defer()` with `Q.defer().promise`, the `put` method would be resolving a promise object instead, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred object with the given value, while `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object. In the original code, the `put` method resolves the `ends` deferred object with a new object that contains the `head` and `tail` properties. However, if
