  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+[a-z]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex would require the last character of the path to be a lowercase letter, which is not the case with the original regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+[0-9]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex would require the last character of the path to be a number, which is not the case with the original regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+[a-z0-9]$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the new regex would require the last character of the path to be a lowercase letter or a number, which is not the case with the original regex.

DONE.
