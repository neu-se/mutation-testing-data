  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is incremented by 1, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is multiplied by 2, which changes the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is decremented by 1, which changes the result of the calculation.

DONE.
