  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Different error message');
```
This would result in different behavior because the thrown error would have a different message, which would affect how it is handled by the `onerror` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the thrown error would be a different object, which would affect how it is handled by the `onerror` callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw { error: error + 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because the thrown error would be a different object, which would affect how it is handled by the `onerror` callback.

DONE.
