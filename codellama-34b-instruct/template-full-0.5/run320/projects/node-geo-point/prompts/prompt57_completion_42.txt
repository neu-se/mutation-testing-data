  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the second point instead of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the mathematical constant pi instead of the latitude of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(φ1 + φ2) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the average of the latitudes of the two points instead of the latitude of the first point, which could lead to a different calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
