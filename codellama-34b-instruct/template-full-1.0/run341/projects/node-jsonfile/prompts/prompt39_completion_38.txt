  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns nothing, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise. Using `writeFileSync` in the `universalify.fromCallback` function would cause the code to execute synchronously, which could lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.write
```
This would result in different behavior because `write` is a method that writes data to a file, whereas `writeFile` is a method that writes data to a file and creates it if it does not exist. Using `write` in the `universalify.fromCallback` function would cause the code to write to an existing file, which could cause unintended consequences if the file does not exist or if the data being written is not valid JSON.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeJson
```
This would result in
