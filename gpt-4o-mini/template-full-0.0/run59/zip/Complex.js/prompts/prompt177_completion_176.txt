Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the divisor from `c` to `c + 1`, which could lead to incorrect results in the division operation, especially when `c` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the reference to `c` with `d`, which could lead to incorrect calculations in the division logic, particularly when `c` and `d` have different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the variable `c` with a constant `0`, which would cause a division by zero scenario when `d` is not zero, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect results.

DONE.
