 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules.push([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of rules will be reversed, potentially changing the output of the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rules = rules.concat([match, result])
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule will be appended to the `rules` array instead of being inserted at the beginning, potentially changing the output of the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
var newRules = [match, result];
// ... (some other code here)
rules = newRules.concat(rules);
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule will be added to the beginning of the `rules` array, but the original `rules` array will be kept intact, potentially changing the output of the `plural` function.

DONE.
