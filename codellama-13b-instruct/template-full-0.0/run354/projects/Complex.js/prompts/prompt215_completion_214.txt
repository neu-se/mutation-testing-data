  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while this code fragment calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while this code fragment calculates the difference of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while this code fragment calculates the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
