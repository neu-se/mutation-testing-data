  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `sinφ2` value to be incremented by 1, which would change the resulting `φ2` value and the `latitude` and `longitude` values calculated from it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `sinφ2` value to be doubled, which would change the resulting `φ2` value and the `latitude` and `longitude` values calculated from it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `sinφ2` value to be decremented by 1, which would change the resulting `φ2` value and the `latitude` and `longitude` values calculated from it
