  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the `load` event, which could cause any listeners to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the `load` event, which could cause any listeners to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different value for the `load` event, which could cause any listeners to behave differently.

DONE.
