 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` would always return `false`, even for pending promises. The original code checks if the object is an instance of `Promise` and if its state is "pending". This change replaces the object with a boolean value, which would cause the condition to always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` would return `undefined` instead of throwing a `TypeError`. The original code checks if the object is an instance of `Promise`. This change replaces the object with `null`, which is not an instance of `Promise`, so `isPending` would return `undefined` instead of throwing a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Proxy({}, {
  get: function() {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized access');
  }
})
```
This would result in
