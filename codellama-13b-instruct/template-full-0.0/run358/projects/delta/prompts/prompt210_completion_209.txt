  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `ops` array, which could cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first element of the `ops` array, which could cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the second element of the `ops` array, which could cause the `diff` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
