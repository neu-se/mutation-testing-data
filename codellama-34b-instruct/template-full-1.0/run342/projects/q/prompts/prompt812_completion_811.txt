  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise()` would return a new promise object, which would then be passed to the `then` function, causing a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback()` would be called with no arguments, which would cause a runtime error if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` is a function that calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `callback.call()` would attempt to call a property named `call` on the `callback` object, which is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
