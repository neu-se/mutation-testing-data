 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using the `defer` object's `resolve` method with the rejected argument, it creates a new rejected promise, which might not be handled by the same error handling mechanism as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
_rejected(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the error handling mechanism by replacing the exception with a null value, which might cause some errors to go unnoticed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with the exception instead of rejecting it, causing the success callback to be called instead of the error callback.

DONE.
