  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '\''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is not escaped properly, which could lead to unexpected results when the `parse()` function is called with a URL containing a path that ends with "/index.xxxxx" (where "xxxx" is a suffix that matches the regular expression).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is not escaped properly, which could lead to unexpected results when the `parse()` function is called with a URL containing a path that ends with "/index.xxxxx" (where "xxxx" is a suffix that matches the regular expression). The space character at the end of the replacement string would also cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'some_random_string'
```
