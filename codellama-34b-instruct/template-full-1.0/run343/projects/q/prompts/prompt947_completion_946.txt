  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method would be called with a non-standard argument, which would cause it to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.nodeResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeResolve` is not a method of the `deferred` object, and attempting to call it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called with a non-standard `this` argument, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
