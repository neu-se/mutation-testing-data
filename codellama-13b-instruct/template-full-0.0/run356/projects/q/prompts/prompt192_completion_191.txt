  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would now return the uppercase version of the stack line, which could potentially cause issues if the original code relied on the case of the stack line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would now return the lowercase version of the stack line, which could potentially cause issues if the original code relied on the case of the stack line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function would now return only the first part of the stack line, which could potentially cause issues if the original code relied on the full stack line.

DONE.
