  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the `op` function, which may cause the `else if` block to be executed when it should not, leading to a potential bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `op` function to `true`, which may cause the `else if` block to be executed when it should not, leading to a potential bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `op` function to `false`, which may cause the `else if` block to be skipped when it should be executed, leading to a potential bug.

DONE.
