  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that returns `undefined`, while `null` is a distinct value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that returns `undefined`, while `undefined` is a distinct value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that returns `undefined`, while `0` is a distinct value.

DONE.
