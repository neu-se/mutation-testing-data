  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the given string is present in the `text` property of the `tmpUrl` object, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment uses the `includes` method on the `text` property of the `tmpUrl` object to check if the `text` argument is already present in the `text` property, which is a more appropriate check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method checks if the given string is present in the `text` property of the `tmpUrl` object, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment uses the `indexOf` method on the `text` property of the `tmpUrl` object to check if the `text` argument is already present in the `text` property, which is a more appropriate check.

Option 3: The PL
