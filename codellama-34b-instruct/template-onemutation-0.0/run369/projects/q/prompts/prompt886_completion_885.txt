  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `array_slice` function with the `arguments` object as its `this` value, which would cause the function to return an empty array, rather than the expected array of arguments.
