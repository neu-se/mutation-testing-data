  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the stack trace rather than the stack trace itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.split('\n')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the first line of the stack trace rather than the entire trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.split('\n').slice(-2).join('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the last two lines of the stack trace rather than the entire trace.

DONE.
