  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete === lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are both numbers, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the operands. In the original code, `typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != null` checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not null, but it does not check for strict equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete !== newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.delete` and `newOp.delete` are both numbers, and the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, including the type of the operands. In the original code, `typeof lastOp.delete === 'number' && newOp.insert != null` checks if `lastOp.delete` is a number and `newOp.insert` is not null, but
