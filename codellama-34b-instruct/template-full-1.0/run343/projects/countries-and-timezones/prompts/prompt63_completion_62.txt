  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id, // some comment
```
This would result in different behavior because introducing a comment after the line would break the parser and make the code not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 123456789,
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a different value than the function expects would cause the function to return unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 1,
```
This would result in different behavior because computing a different value than the function expects would cause the function to return unexpected results.

DONE.
