  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause issues if the functions depend on the order in which they are called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the list, which could cause issues if the functions do not expect this extra argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progressed, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument has been added to the end of the list, which could cause issues if the functions do not expect this extra argument.

DONE.
