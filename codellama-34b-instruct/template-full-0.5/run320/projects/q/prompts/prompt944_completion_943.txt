  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` variable would be set to null, which would change the context of the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` variable would be set to undefined, which would also change the context of the function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` variable would be set to 0, which would change the context of the function being called.

DONE.
