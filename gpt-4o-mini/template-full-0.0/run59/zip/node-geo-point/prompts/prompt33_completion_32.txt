Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the latitude of `point1` instead of its longitude, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude of `point2` instead of `point1`, which would yield an incorrect distance calculation as it mixes the coordinates of the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the longitude of `point1`, which would artificially inflate the distance calculation, resulting in an incorrect distance value.

DONE.
