  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next op, while `peekLength()` returns the length of the next op.

DONE.
