  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.promise` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and it may have different properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise.source` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and it may have different properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(resolvedPromise)` is a different object than `resolvedPromise`, and it may have different properties or methods.

DONE.
