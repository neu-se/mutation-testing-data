  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which would return `false` if either `test` or `false` is `false`, causing the `filter` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which would return `true` if either `test` or `true` is `true`, causing the `filter` function to return a different result.

DONE.
