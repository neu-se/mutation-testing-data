  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `w.replace` method is used to replace a substring within a string, while `w + '*'` simply concatenates the string `w` with the string `'*'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.charAt(0) + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.charAt(0)` returns the first character of the string `w`, while `w.replace` replaces a substring within the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w[0] + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because `w[0]` returns the first character of the string `w`, while `w.replace` replaces a substring within the string.

DONE.
