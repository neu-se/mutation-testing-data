  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the longitude value would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the longitude value would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be used instead of the longitude value, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 90 degrees.

DONE.
