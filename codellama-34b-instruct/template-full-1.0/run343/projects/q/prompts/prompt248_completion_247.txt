  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `.lastIndexOf` searches for the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `.indexOf` searches for the first occurrence. In this case, the code is searching for the line number where the error was thrown, and using `.lastIndexOf` would give the line number of the last line of the stack trace, rather than the line number of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf(" at ") + 4
```
This would result in different behavior because `.indexOf` searches for the first occurrence of the specified value, whereas `.lastIndexOf` searches for the last occurrence. In this case, the code is searching for the position of the " at " part of the stack trace, and using `.lastIndexOf` would give the position of the last occurrence of " at ", rather than the first occurrence.
