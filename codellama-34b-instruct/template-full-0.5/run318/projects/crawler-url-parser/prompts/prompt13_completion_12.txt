  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the URL with "https" instead of "http", potentially changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the URL with "ftp" instead of "http", potentially changing the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol of the URL with "file" instead of "http", potentially changing the behavior of the code.

DONE.
