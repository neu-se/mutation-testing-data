  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for the `hasOwnProperty` check, even if the object does not have the specified property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `hasOwnProperty` check, even if the object has the specified property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for the `hasOwnProperty` check, even if the object has the specified property.

DONE.
