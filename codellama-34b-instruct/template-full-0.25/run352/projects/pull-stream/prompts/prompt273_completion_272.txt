  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` is not a function, while this new code fragment checks if the `stream` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` is not a function, while this new code fragment checks if the `stream` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof stream !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` is not a function, while this new code fragment checks if the `stream` is not a function using a different syntax.

DONE.
