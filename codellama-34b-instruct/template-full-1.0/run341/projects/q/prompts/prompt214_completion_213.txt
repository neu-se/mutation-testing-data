  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the given code fragment uses the `isPromiseAlike` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. Replacing it with `typeof value === "object"` would cause the code to behave differently if the `value` parameter is an object, but not necessarily a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a method that checks if a value is a promise, and replaces it with `instanceof` operator it would make the code behave differently if the `value` parameter is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.hasOwnProperty("then")
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a method that checks if a value is a promise, and replaces it with checking if the `then` property is present, which is a
