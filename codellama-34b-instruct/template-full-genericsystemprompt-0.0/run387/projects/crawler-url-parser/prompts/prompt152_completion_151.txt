  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any difference in the number of path parts as a sublevel link, rather than only considering a difference of 1 as a sublevel link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any difference in the number of path parts as an uplevel link, rather than only considering a difference of -1 as an uplevel link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any difference in the number of path parts as an internal link, rather than only considering a difference of 0 as an internal link.

DONE.
