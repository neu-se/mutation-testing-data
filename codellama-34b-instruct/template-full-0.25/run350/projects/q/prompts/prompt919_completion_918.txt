  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a `null` argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause an error.

DONE.
