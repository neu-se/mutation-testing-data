  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value that is not equivalent to `end`, and therefore the `return cb && cb(end)` statement would be executed even if `end` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value that is not equivalent to `end`, and therefore the `return cb && cb(end)` statement would be executed even if `end` is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is not guaranteed to be defined, and therefore the `return cb(null, generate())` statement would not be executed.

DONE.
