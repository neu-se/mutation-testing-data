  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback. In this case, the callback `noop` returns `undefined`, so the new promise would be resolved with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop).then(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second `then` method is called on the promise returned by the first `then` method, which is resolved with the return value of the first callback. In this case, the second callback `noop` returns `undefined`, so the new promise would be resolved with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by the first `then` method
