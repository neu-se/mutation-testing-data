  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method with a truthy value as its argument would cause the read stream to error, whereas the original code fragment did not include this argument and would therefore not cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(this.path);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method with a string value as its argument would cause the read stream to error with a file not found error, whereas the original code fragment did not include this argument and would not error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method with a null value as its argument would cause the read stream to error with a file not found error, whereas the original code fragment did not include this argument and would not error.

DONE.
