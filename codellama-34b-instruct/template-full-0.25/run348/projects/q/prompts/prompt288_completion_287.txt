  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` expects a value, not a promise, and `Q(value)` returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
