  Sure, here are three mutants for you to consider:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules) {
  if (rule.matches(path, ctx)) {
    return true;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is not called on the `rule` object, which could lead to incorrect results when checking if a path is governed by this policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules) {
  if (rule.matches(path, ctx) === 'match') {
    return true;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method is now being called with the wrong number of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior when checking if a path is governed by this policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules) {
  if (rule.matches(path
