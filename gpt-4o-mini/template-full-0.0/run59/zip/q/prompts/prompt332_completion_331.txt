Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the result, it would reject the promise, causing any subsequent `.then()` handlers for success to be skipped and the error to be propagated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` regardless of the actual result, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promise's value in the `.then()` chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, which may not be the intended value, leading to confusion or errors in the promise's consumers that expect a specific value.

DONE.
