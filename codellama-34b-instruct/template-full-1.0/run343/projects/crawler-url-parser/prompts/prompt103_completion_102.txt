  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code because it is simply a copy-paste of the original line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is the logical inverse of the original line, so it would add the `text` to the `tmpUrl.text` property if it is not already present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add the `text` to the `tmpUrl.text` property if it is not already present and it is also the first part of the string.

DONE.
