  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` would replace all occurrences of the given regular expression in the string, while `replace` would only replace the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match and replace all characters until the end of the string, while the original regular expression would only match and replace the last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/[^\/]*$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match and replace all characters until the end of the string, while the original regular expression would only match and replace the last character.

DONE.
