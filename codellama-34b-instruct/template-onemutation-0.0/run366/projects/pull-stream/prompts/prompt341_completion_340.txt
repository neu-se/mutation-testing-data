  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which inverts the truthiness of the expression. In this case, it would invert the result of the `seen[key]` expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `seen[key]`. This would cause the `unique` function to always return `true`, regardless of whether the item has already been seen or not.
