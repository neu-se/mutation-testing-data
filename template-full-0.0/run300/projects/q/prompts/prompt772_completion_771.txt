  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `promises.length` to determine the number of promises in the array, while this replacement code fragment uses `promises.length - 1`, which would result in the last promise being ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `promises.length` to determine the number of promises in the array, while this replacement code fragment uses `promises.length * 2`, which would result in the number of promises being doubled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `promises.length` to determine the number of promises in the array, while this replacement code fragment uses `promises.length + 1`, which would result in an extra promise being added to
