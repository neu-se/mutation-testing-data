  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the order of the elements in the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the number of elements in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the length of the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs[0]` refers to the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of the array. This could cause the function to behave differently if it relies on the
