  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"deferred"
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferred" is a different promise state than "promise".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a promise and would not have the same properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123456
```
This would result in different behavior because a number is not a promise and would throw a syntax error when trying to access its properties and methods.

DONE.
