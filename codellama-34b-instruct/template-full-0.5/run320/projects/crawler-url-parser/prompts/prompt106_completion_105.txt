  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to add a new key-value pair to the `Map` object, while the `get` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a key. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the `urlMap` to be updated with the new `currentUrl` object, which could result in different behavior when the `urlMap` is accessed later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to remove a key-value pair from the `Map` object, while the `get` method is used to retrieve the value associated with a key. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the `urlMap` to be updated by removing the `currentUrl` object, which could result in different behavior when the `urlMap` is accessed later in
