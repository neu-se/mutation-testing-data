Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat a non-empty array of promises as empty, leading to the function resolving immediately instead of processing the promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the function to proceed if there is exactly one promise, ignoring cases with multiple promises, which would lead to incorrect handling of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to resolve immediately if there is at least one promise, which is the opposite of the intended logic that should only proceed if there are no promises.

DONE.
