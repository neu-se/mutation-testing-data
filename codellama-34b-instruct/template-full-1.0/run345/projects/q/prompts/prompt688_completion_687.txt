  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch` is already bound to `this` in the original code, so the `bind` call would not have any effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` does not have a `dispatch` method, so the call to `bind` would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` is a static method that does not use `this` as the context, so the `bind` call would not have any effect.

DONE.
