  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function, and `call` is a method that allows you to call a function with a specific `this` value. In this case, we are calling `hasOwnProperty` with `object` as the `this` value, which means that the function will return `true` if `object` has a property called `prop`, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
