  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute only once, instead of iterating over the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute zero times, instead of iterating over the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute in reverse, starting from the last element of the array and ending at the first element.

DONE.
