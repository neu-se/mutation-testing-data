  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!countries` checks if the `countries` variable is falsy, while `countries.length === 0` checks if the `countries` array is empty. If `countries` is not an array, it will throw a `TypeError` in the latter case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!countries` checks if the `countries` variable is falsy, while `countries.includes(undefined)` checks if the `countries` array contains the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.some(country => country === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!countries` checks if the `countries` variable is falsy, while `count
