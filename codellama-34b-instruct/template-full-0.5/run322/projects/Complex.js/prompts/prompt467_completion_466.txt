  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero, while this code fragment checks if `a` is greater than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero, while this code fragment checks if `a` is less than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero, while this code fragment checks if `a` is equal to zero.

DONE.
