  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument passed to the function, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){return arguments;}())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a new function instance, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function(){return arguments()}())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the result of calling the `arguments` function with no arguments, which would result in an error.

DONE.
