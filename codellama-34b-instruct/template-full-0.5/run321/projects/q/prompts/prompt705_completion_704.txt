  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a local variable in the `fbind` function, and it contains the arguments passed to the function, whereas `arguments` is a special variable that contains the arguments passed to the function. Using `args` instead of `arguments` would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would refer to the first argument passed to the function, whereas `arguments` refers to all the arguments passed to the function. Using `arguments[0]` instead of `arguments` would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the object that the function is called on, whereas `arguments` refers to the arguments passed to the function. Using `this` instead of `arguments` would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
