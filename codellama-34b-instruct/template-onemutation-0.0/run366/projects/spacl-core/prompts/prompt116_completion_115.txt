  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `verbs` object instead of the `verbs` array, which could lead to unexpected results if the `verbs` object has a different structure than the `verbs` array.
