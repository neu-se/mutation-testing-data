  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `c` is less than `d`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `c` is greater than `d`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `a` is less than `b`, regardless of the values of `c` and `d`.

DONE.
