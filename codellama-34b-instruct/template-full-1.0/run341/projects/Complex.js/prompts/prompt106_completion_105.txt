  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string, rather than calling the `parser_exit` function, which would terminate the tokenizer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
= 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the string 'test' to the variable instead of comparing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!== 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the test always fail, even if the token is valid.

DONE.
