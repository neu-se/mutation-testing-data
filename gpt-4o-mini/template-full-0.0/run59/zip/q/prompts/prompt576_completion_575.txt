Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the `callback` function to `null`, which may lead to unexpected results when `this` is referenced inside the `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next", "extraArg")
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument `"extraArg"` to the `continuer` function call, which is not expected and could cause errors or unintended behavior in the generator's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the verb from `"next"` to `"throw"`, which would cause the generator to throw an exception instead of continuing its execution, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
