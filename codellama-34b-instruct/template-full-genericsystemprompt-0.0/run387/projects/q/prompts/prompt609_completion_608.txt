  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called instead of the `resolve` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would be called on the `args` array, which would cause the first element of the array to be removed before it is passed to the `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, op, args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would be called on the `args` array, which would cause the number `1` to be added to the end of the array before it is passed to the `resolve` method.

DONE.
