  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of arguments is exactly 2, while this new code fragment checks if the number of arguments is exactly 3. This would cause the test to fail if the function is called with more than 2 arguments, which could indicate a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of arguments is exactly 2, while this new code fragment checks if the number of arguments is greater than 2. This would cause the test to fail if the function is called with more than 2 arguments, which could indicate a weakness in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of arguments is exactly 2, while this new code fragment
