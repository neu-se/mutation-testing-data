  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses `Math.floor` instead of `Math.ceil`. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the modulo operator instead of division. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses division instead of `Math.ceil`. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.

DONE.
