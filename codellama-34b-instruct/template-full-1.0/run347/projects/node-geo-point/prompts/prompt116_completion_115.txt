  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.calculateDestination(distance, bearing); + HTMLStyle('color:red; font-size:12px')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be made on the instance of the class, instead of on the class itself, which would cause the function to be evaluated in the context of the instance, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(new GeoPoint(0, 0), distance, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called on a new instance of the GeoPoint class, with the latitude and longitude values set to 0, instead of on the original instance of the class, which would cause the function to be evaluated with different arguments, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing * 2)
```
This would result in
