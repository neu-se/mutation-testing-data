  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is not a function, it's an object, so it would cause a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is not a function, it's an object, so it would cause a `TypeError`.

DONE.
