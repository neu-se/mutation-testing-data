  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates' + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation with '0' would cause the code to access the property 'coordinates0' instead of 'coordinates', which might not exist or have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the property accessor [] would convert the property value to a string, resulting in the first character of the property value instead of the entire value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be accessing the 'longitude' property of the object instead of the 'coordinates' property, which might not exist or have a different value.

DONE.
