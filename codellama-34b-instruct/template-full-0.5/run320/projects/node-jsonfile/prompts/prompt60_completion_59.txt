  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` operator would negate the result of `Buffer.isBuffer(content)`, making the code always enter the `if` block regardless of the type of `content`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `content.length > 0` would cause the code to only enter the `if` block if `content` is a buffer and has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) || content.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `content.length === 0` would cause the code to only enter the `if` block if `content` is a buffer and has a length of 0.

DONE.
