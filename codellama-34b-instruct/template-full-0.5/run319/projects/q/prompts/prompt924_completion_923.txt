  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` except the first one, whereas `nodeArgs` itself is an array that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.pop()` removes and returns the last element of `nodeArgs`, whereas `nodeArgs` itself is an array that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.shift()` removes and returns the first element of `nodeArgs`, whereas `nodeArgs` itself is an array that contains all the arguments passed to the function.

DONE.
