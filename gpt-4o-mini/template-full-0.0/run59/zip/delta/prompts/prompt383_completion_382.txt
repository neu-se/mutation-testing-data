Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` will return the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, potentially causing the algorithm to process more characters than intended, leading to incorrect transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length will cause the algorithm to always attempt to process one more character than available, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect handling of the remaining operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because using 0 will cause the algorithm to ignore the lengths of both operations entirely, effectively treating them as if they have no length, which could lead to incorrect transformations and data loss.

DONE.
