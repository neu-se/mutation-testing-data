  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is a number, but the condition is checking if it's a string. This would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is a number, but the condition is checking if it's `undefined`. This would cause the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is a number, but the condition is checking if it's not equal to 0. This would cause the function to return the wrong value for some inputs.

DONE.
