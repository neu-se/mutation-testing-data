  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to `setImmediate`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called instead of the callback function, which would not have the same effect.

DONE.
