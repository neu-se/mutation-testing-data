  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the assignment of the `retain` property to the `newOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was assigning the `retain` property to the `newOp` object with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was assigning the `retain` property to the `newOp` object with a different value.

DONE.
