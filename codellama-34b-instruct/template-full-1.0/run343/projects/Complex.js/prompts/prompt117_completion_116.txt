  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because division by zero yields NaN, whereas the original code snippet would return Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator produces a different result than the original code snippet, which uses the subtraction operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator produces a different result than the original code snippet, which uses the addition operator.

DONE.
