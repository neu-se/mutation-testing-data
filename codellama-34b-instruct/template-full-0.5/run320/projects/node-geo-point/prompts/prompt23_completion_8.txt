  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property to create the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would concatenate the `latitude` and `longitude` properties instead of using them separately to create the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 180 - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use a random latitude value instead of the actual latitude value from the `LatLng` object.

DONE.
