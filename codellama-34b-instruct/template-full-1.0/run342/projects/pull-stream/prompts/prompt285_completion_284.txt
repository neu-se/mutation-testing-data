  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the boolean value of the expression, which in this case would cause the function to always return `null` instead of the mapped value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the function to always return `null + null`, which is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb * null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the function to always return `null * null`, which is `null`.

DONE.
