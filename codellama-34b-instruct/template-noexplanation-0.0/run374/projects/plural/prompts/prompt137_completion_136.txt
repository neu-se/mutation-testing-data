  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This will cause the function to return the first element of the `rules` array, which is a regular expression, instead of the second element, which is the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 's'
```
This will cause the function to return the plural form of the word, but with an extra 's' at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toLowerCase()
```
This will cause the function to return the plural form of the word in lowercase.

DONE.
