  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the Unicode Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the beginning of the string, while the new code fragment uses a string literal to match the BOM. The regular expression would match the BOM regardless of its position in the string, while the string literal would only match the BOM if it is at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
