  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while this replacement code fragment would return an empty object.

DONE.
