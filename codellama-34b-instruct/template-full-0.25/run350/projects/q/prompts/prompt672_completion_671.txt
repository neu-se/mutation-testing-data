  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would always resolve the promise, regardless of the outcome of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` would create a new deferred object, which would not be the same as the original deferred object that was created by the `defer` function.

DONE.
