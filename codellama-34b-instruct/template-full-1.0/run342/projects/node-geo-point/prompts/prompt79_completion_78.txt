  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because longitude and latitude are reversed. The calculateDestination function would return a different destination point as a result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be increased by 1, which would lead to a different point being calculated for the destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be multiplied by 2, which would lead to a different point being calculated for the destination.

DONE.
