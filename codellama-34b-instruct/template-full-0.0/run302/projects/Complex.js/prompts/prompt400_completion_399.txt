  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + Math.sqrt(1 + c * c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cosh` function, which is the hyperbolic cosine, while this replacement uses the `sqrt` function, which is the square root. These functions have different properties and will produce different results, even though they are related.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
