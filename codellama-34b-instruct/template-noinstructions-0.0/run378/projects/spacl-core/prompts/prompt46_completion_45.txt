  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the part if it starts with a slash, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/^\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the part if it ends with a slash, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the part if it contains an empty segment, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
