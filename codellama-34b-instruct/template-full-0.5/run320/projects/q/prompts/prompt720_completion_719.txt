  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `defer` to create a new promise and then resolves it with `promises`, whereas this replacement code resolves the existing `deferred` promise with `promises`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `defer` to create a new promise and then resolves it with `promises`, whereas this replacement code rejects the existing `deferred` promise with `promises`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `defer` to create a new promise and then resolves it with `promises`, whereas this replacement code notifies the existing `deferred` promise with `promises`.

DONE.
