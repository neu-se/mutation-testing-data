Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which the generator function is called, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the generator relies on `this` being a specific object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the generator function with `null` as its context, which may cause issues if the generator function expects a specific `this` context to operate correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator.apply(this, [1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the generator function to always receive the arguments `1, 2, 3`, regardless of what arguments were actually passed, which could lead to incorrect behavior or errors in the generator logic.

DONE.
