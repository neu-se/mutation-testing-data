  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is not called, and the result of the expression `op + 1` is not used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is called with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code where `op` is called without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is called with two arguments, which is not the same as the original code where `op` is called with one argument.

DONE.
