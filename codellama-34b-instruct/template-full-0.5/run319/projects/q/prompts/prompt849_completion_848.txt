  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is called with a different argument than the original code, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message or object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is called with a different argument than the original code, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is called with a different argument than the original code, which could cause the promise to be notified with a different error message or object.

DONE.
