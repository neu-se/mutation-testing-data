Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', potentially allowing configurations with an 'extends' property to bypass the extension logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the 'extends' property of the config object is its own property, rather than checking if it has a property named 'extends', which could lead to incorrect results if the 'extends' property is inherited.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extends' in config
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the 'extends' property exists in the config object or its prototype chain, rather than checking if it is the object's own property, which could lead to different results if the 'extends' property is inherited.

DONE.
