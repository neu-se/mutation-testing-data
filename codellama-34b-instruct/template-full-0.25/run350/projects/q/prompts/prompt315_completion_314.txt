  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function, and `null` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" for `fallback` and "null" for `null`, causing the conditional statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" for `fallback` and "undefined" for `undefined`, causing the conditional statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fallback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `fallback` is a function, and the string "function" is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" for `fallback`
