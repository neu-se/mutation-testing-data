  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the value of the promise, while the new code fragment `function () {}` is a function that does nothing, so it would not have the same effect on the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the value of the promise, while the new code fragment `null` is a null value, so it would not have the same effect on the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the value of the promise, while the new code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value, so it would not have the same effect on the promise.

DONE.
