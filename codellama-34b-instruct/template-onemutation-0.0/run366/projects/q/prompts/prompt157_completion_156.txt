  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_defineProperty(error, "stack", {value: stack, configurable: true});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `configurable` property is set to `true`, which allows the property to be deleted or changed. In the original code, the `configurable` property is set to `false`, which prevents the property from being deleted or changed.

DONE.
