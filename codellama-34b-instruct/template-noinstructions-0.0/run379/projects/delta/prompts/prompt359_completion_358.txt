  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `priority`, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `priority`, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, priority * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would multiply the value of `priority` by 2, potentially causing the `transformPosition` method to behave differently.

DONE.
