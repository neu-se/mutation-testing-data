  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the `push` method to insert the new operation at the next index, rather than the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable is decremented by 1, which would cause the `push` method to insert the new operation at the previous index, rather than the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because a random index between 0 and the length of the `ops` array is generated, which would cause the `push` method to insert the new operation at a random index, rather than the current index.

DONE.
