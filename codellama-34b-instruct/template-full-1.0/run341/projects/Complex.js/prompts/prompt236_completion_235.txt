  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `a` has been replaced with `b`, which means that the calculation would use the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (a - r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator has been changed to addition, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator has been changed to division, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
