  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(path.dirname(options.dest), path.basename(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the directory name and the base name of the destination path, while `path.extname` returns the extension of a path.

DONE.
