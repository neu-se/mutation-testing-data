  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFFFE/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now matching a different character, which may not be present in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now matching the BOM character globally, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern is now matching the BOM character case-insensitively, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
