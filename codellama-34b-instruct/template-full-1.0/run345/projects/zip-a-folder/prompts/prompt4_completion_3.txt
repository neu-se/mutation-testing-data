  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `zip` method to use the default compression level (high) even if the user has specified a different compression level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `zip` method to always use the high compression level, regardless of what the user has specified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `zip` method to use the medium compression level, regardless of what the user has specified.

DONE.
