  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment performs a multiplication operation, whereas the replaced code fragment performs a division operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ** b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment performs a multiplication operation, whereas the replaced code fragment performs an exponentiation operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a % b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment performs a multiplication operation, whereas the replaced code fragment performs a modulo operation.
