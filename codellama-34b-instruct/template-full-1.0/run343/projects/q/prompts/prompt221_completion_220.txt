  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
refactor
```
This would result in different behavior because "refactor" is not a function, whereas "object_create" is a function that is used to create a new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because "null" is a primitive value, whereas "object_create" is a function that returns a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because "[]" is an array, whereas "object_create" is a function that returns a new object.

DONE.
