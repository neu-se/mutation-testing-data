 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would receive `null` as the first argument instead of the data, potentially causing issues if the consumer of the `find` function expects the data to be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
