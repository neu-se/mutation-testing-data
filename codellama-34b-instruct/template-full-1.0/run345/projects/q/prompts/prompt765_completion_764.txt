  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop())
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop())` would return a new promise that has already been resolved with the result of the `noop()` function, which is undefined. In contrast, the original code `promise` would return a new promise that is pending the resolution of the original promise, which is not desirable in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(notification => when(notification, noop()))
```
This would result in different behavior because `prom
