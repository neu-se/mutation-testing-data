  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = (point2.latitude * 2) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the latitude value to radians, but this code fragment multiplies the latitude value by 2 and then takes the remainder after dividing by 360, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = Math.sin(point2.latitude) * Math.PI / 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the latitude value to radians, but this code fragment uses the `Math.sin` function to calculate the sine of the latitude value and then multiplies the result by `Math.PI / 180`, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = Math.ac
