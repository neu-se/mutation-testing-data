  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `args` is `null`, while this replacement checks if the length of `args` is 0. If `args` is an empty array, the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this replacement would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `args` is `null`, while this replacement checks if the length of `args` is 0. If `args` is an empty array, the original code would still execute the `if` block, but this replacement would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `args` is `null`, while this replacement checks if the length of `args` is 1. If `args` is an array
