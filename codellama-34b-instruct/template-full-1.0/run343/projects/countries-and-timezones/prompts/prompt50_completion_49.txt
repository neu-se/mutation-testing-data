  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```getTextTimezone```
This would result in different behavior because ```getTextTimezone``` is not a function in the original code, and will cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```getTimezone(key)```
This would result in different behavior because the ```key``` parameter is not passed in the original code, and will cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```timezones[key]```
This would result in different behavior because the ```timezones``` object is not defined in the original code, and will cause a runtime error.

DONE.
