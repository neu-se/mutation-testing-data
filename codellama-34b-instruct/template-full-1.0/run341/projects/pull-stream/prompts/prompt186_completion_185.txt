  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` is not an array index and will return `undefined`, causing the `else` clause to be executed with `array[i]` being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `i + 1` is not an array index and will return `undefined`, causing the `else` clause to be executed with `array[i + 1]` being `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[i + array.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because `i + array.length` is beyond the bounds of the array and will return `undefined`, causing the `else` clause to be executed with `array[i + array.length]` being `undefined`.

DONE.
