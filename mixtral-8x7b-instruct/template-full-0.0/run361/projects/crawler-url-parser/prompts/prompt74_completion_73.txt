 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('base')[0].attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the first 'base' element directly, which may not always exist, causing a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('body base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to find the 'base' element within the 'body' tag, which may not always exist, causing a different selection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('head base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to find the 'base' element within the 'head' tag, which may not always exist, causing a different selection.

DONE.
