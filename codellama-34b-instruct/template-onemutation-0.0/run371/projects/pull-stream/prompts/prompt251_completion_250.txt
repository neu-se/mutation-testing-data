  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `cb` function as the second argument to the `_read` function, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the `_read` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
