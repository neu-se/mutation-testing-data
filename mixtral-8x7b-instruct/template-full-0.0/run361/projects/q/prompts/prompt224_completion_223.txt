 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would not inherit from `Promise.prototype`, and thus would not have access to the methods and properties defined on the prototype, such as `.then()` or `.catch()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would inherit from a plain object instead of `Promise.prototype`, and thus would not have access to the methods and properties defined on the prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would inherit from a function object instead of `Promise.prototype`, and thus would not have access to the methods and properties defined on the prototype.

DONE.
