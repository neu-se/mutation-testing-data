  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys` method returns an array of all the enumerable properties of an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of all the enumerable properties of an object that are also present in the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.values` method returns an array of all the enumerable properties of an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of all the enumerable properties of an object that are also present in the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.entries` method returns an array of all the enumerable properties of an object, whereas the original code fragment returns an array of all the enumerable properties of an object that are also present in the `b` object
