  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always return one less character than the original code, which could cause the pluralization of words to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always return one more character than the original code, which could cause the pluralization of words to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always return twice as many characters as the original code, which could cause the pluralization of words to be incorrect.

DONE.
