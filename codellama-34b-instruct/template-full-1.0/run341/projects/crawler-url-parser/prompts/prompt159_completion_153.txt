  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last element of the array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the 42nd element of the array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring of the `text` variable starting at index 1 instead of the `text` variable itself.

DONE.
