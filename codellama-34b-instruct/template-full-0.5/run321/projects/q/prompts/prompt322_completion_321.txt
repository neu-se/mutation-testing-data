  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the elements starting from the specified index, instead of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with the elements from the original array and the specified value, instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the elements from the original array, but with each element transformed by the specified function, instead of the original array.

DONE.
