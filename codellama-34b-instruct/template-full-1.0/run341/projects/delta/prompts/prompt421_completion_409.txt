  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because when `index - offset` is less than `length`, the `while` loop would terminate earlier than it should, potentially leaving some deletions un accounted for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because when `length + 1` is greater than `index`, the `while` loop would run for more iterations than it should, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because when `offset - index` is greater than `length`, the `while` loop would terminate earlier than it should, potentially leaving some deletions un accounted for.

DONE.
