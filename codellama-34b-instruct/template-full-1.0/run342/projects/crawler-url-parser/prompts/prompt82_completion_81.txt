  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first character of the `href` attribute instead of the entire attribute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').substring(0, 3);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of the `href` attribute starting at index 0 and ending at index 3, instead of the entire attribute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any whitespace at the beginning and end of the `href` attribute value, which could result in a different URL being extracted.

DONE.
