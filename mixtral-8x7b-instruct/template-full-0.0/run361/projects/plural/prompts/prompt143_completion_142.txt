 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the rule[0] to a string, instead of checking if it's a RegExp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name of the rule[0], which may not be accurate in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor === RegExp
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the rule[0] is an instance of RegExp, which may not be accurate in all cases.

DONE.
