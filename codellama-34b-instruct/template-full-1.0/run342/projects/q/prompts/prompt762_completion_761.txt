  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Testing mutation 1")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected, causing the `allResolved` method to return a rejected promise rather than a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("Testing mutation 2")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected, causing the `allResolved` method to return a rejected promise rather than a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` rather than a rejected promise, causing the `allResolved` method to return a resolved promise with `undefined` rather than a rejected promise.

DONE.
