 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * value
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the `value` argument from the original type (which could be any type) to a number type due to the multiplication by the number 1. This could potentially cause issues if the original code expects a non-number type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value || true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value of the `Q` function when `value` is falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `''`, etc.). The original code returns a resolved promise with the `value` as its value, while the mutated code returns a resolved promise with the value `true` when `value` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value ? value : 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the return value of the `Q` function when
