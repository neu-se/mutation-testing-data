  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `value` argument if it is not null, while this code fragment always calls the callback function with the `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `value` argument if it is not null, while this code fragment always calls the callback function with the `_value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `value` argument if it is not null, while this code fragment always calls the callback function with the `value + 1` argument.

DONE.
