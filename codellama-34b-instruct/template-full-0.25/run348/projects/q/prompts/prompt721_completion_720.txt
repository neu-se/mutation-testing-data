  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior. The `deferred.resolve` method should be called with the resolved value of the promise, not the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the first element of the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior. The `deferred.resolve` method should be called with the resolved value of the promise, not the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called with the length of the `promises` array, which is not the intended behavior.
