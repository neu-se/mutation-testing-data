  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as its argument, but `null` is not a function, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as its argument, but `function() {}` is an empty function that does nothing, so it would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is defined earlier in the code, but it is not the same function as `requestTick`, so it would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
