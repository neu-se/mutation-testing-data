  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would result in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would result in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would result in a runtime error.

DONE.
