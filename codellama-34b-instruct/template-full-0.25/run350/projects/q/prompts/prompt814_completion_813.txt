  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would be executed in a different context, potentially causing unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would return a value that is not the same as the original `throw` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return Q.reject(reason);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method would return a rejected promise, which is not the same as the original `throw` statement.

DONE.
