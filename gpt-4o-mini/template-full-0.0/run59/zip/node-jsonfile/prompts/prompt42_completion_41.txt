Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` does not allow for custom serialization options like the `stringify` function might, potentially leading to different output formats or missing properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, { space: 2 })
```
This would result in different behavior because adding `{ space: 2 }` as an option would format the output with indentation, changing the string representation of the object and potentially affecting how it is stored in the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` may not produce a valid JSON string representation of the object, leading to errors when trying to parse the content back into an object.

DONE.
