  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isInfinite()` method, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is not infinite, rather than `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero()` method checks if the complex number is equal to zero, rather than checking if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property represents the imaginary part of the complex number, and checking if it is equal to zero would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is not infinite, rather than `false`.

DONE.
