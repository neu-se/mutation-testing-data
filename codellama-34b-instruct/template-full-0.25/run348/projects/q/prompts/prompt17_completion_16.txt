  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Q is not defined"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown when the `Q` function is called, which would be detected by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Q is not defined"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q` function to return a string instead of a function, which would be detected by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return function () { throw new Error("Q is not defined"); }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Q` function to return a function that throws an error when called, which would be detected by the test suite.

DONE.
