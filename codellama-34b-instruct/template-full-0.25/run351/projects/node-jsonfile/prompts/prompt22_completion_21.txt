  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\ufeff/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `content` variable is being modified directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `content` variable is being sliced instead of modified directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the `content` variable is being substringed instead of modified directly.

DONE.
