 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` function would return a bound function with `this` set to `null`. In the original code, `this` is set to the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` function would return a bound function with `this` set to the number `5`. In the original code, `this` is set to the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbind` function would return a bound function with `this` set to the `window` object. In the original code, `this` is set to the promise object.

DONE.
