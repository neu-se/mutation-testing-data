  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with the rejection reason as an argument, even if the rejection is handled by a `catch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is always fulfilled, even if the original promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, function (error) { throw error; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is always rejected, even if the original promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
