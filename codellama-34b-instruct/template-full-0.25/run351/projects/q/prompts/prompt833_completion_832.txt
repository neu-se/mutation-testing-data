  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `progress` is a function that is not defined in the given code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JavaScript value that is different from `undefined`, whereas `progress` is a function that is not defined in the given code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid JavaScript value that is different from `null`, whereas `progress` is a function that is not defined in the given code snippet.

DONE.
