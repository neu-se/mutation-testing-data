  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would increment the value of `mapper`, which could cause the `return` statement to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(mapper)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log()` function would write the value of `mapper` to the console, which could cause the program to behave differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function returns a random number between 0 and 1, which could cause the program to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
