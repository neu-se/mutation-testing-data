  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(fulfill(value)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with the value of `fulfill(value)`, which would likely be different from the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(reject(value)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected with the value of `reject(value)`, which would likely be different from the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise with the value of `value`, which would likely be different from the original promise.

DONE.
