Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the slice, causing the first segment of the path to be included in the processing instead of being ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).map(p => p.toUpperCase()).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms each segment to uppercase before processing, which could lead to mismatches when matching against paths that are case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split(',').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter from '/' to ',', which would incorrectly split the path specification into segments, likely resulting in an invalid regex pattern.

DONE.
