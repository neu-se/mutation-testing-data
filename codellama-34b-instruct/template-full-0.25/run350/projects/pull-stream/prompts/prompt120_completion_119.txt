  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, while this replacement checks if it's `false`. If `end` is `false`, the original code would return `null`, while this replacement would return `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, while this replacement checks if it's not `true`. If `end` is `false`, the original code would return `null`, while this replacement would return `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `end` is `true`, while this replacement checks if it's truthy. If `end` is `false`, the original code would return `null`, while this replacement would return `end`.
