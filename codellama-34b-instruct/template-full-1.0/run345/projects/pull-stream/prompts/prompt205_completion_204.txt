  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the program to enter an unexpected state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the program to exit the loop prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be reset to 0, which could cause the program to loop indefinitely.

DONE.
