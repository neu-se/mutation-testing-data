  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseArgs` array as the argument to `callback`, rather than the `nodeArgs` array that is intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `nodeArgs` array as the argument to `callback`, rather than the `nodeArgs` array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the argument to `callback`, rather than the `nodeArgs` array that is intended.

DONE.
