  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` is a function that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.sort()` is a function that sorts the elements of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.splice()` is a function that adds/removes elements from an array.

DONE.
