  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a different function than `setImmediate`, and it may have different performance characteristics.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a different function than `setImmediate`, and it may have different performance characteristics.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a different function than `setTimeout`, and it may have different performance characteristics.

DONE.
