  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<data.length - 1>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property is being referenced on the `data` object, which may not be available in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<data.pop()>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method is being called on the `data` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<data.splice(0, 1)>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method is being called on the `data` array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
