  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called twice, once for each event emitted by the `Dirty` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called twice, once for each event emitted by the `Dirty` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('drain', this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called twice, once for each event emitted by the `Dirty` instance, and the `this` keyword would be passed as an argument to the `emit` method.

DONE.
