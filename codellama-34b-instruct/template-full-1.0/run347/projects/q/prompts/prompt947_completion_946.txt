  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver2
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver2` is not a valid method and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver` is not defined and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver({})
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` expects a function as its first argument, and would throw a type error.

DONE.
