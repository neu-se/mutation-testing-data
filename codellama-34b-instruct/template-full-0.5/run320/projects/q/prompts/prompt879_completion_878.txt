  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` expects a function as an argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` expects a function as an argument, and passing `deferred.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` expects a function as an argument, and passing an empty function would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

DONE.
