  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `a && onEnd` would be evaluated first, and then the result would be compared to `!onEnd`. This would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
