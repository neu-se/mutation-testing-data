  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This will cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This will cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This will cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
