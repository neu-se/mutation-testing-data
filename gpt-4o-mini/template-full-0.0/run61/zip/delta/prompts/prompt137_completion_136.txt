Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther == null ||
      typeof firstOther.retain !== 'number' ||
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the conditions to check for `null` and the type of `retain`, which could lead to the code block being executed even when it should not, potentially causing incorrect operations on the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'string' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the condition to fail when it should pass, leading to the subsequent logic not executing as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the check for `attributes` from `== null` to `!== undefined`, which would allow the condition to pass even when `attributes
