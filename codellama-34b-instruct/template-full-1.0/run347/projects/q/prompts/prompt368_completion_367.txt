  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `_rejected` is a function that takes an exception as an argument, and it returns a rejected promise with the same exception. However, if `null` is used instead, it would resolve the promise with the value `null`, which is different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("Different error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be used when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled("Different fulfillment value")
```
This would result in different behavior because a different fulfillment value would be used when the promise is fulfilled.

DONE.
