 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `if` block, changing the sign of the imaginary part of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always execute the `if` block, changing the sign of the imaginary part of the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
oneMinus * onePlus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, changing the sign of the imaginary part of the result when `oneMinus` and `onePlus` have opposite signs.

DONE.
