  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is a function, and calling it would return a string representation of the promise's state, which would be different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` is a property that returns the promise's state as a string, which would be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.isFulfilled` is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether the promise is fulfilled, which would be different from the original code fragment.

DONE.
