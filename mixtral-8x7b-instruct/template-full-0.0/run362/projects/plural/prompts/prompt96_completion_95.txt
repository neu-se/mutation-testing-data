 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/g, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of 'a' with 'e', while the original code only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.replace(/z/, 'e') }
