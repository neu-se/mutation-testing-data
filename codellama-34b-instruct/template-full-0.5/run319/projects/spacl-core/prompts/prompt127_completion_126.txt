  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would start at the second index instead of the first, potentially skipping the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would start at the last index instead of the first, potentially skipping all the elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = Math.random() * this.regex.props.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would start at a random index within the array, potentially skipping some elements or repeating others.

DONE.
