  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would call the `abort()` function, which is not part of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would call the `cb` function with the `true` value as an argument, which is not part of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would call the `null` function, which is not part of the original code.

DONE.
