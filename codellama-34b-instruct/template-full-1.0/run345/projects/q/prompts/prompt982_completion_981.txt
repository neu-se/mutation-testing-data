  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to resolve the promise with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, which may not be the same as the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which may not be the same as the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function.

DONE.
