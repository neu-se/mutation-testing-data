  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the superclass, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the current object, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
RegExp[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Symbol.match` method on the `RegExp` class, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
