  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< bezeichnet >
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is incorrect syntax and will cause a compilation error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is invalid JSON and will be parsed as an object with a `promised` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< jus >
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment is an invalid identifier and will cause a compilation error.
DONE.
