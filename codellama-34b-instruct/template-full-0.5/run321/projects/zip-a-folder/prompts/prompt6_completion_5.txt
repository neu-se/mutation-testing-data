  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, whereas `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension, whereas `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` returns the concatenation of the path and the file name, whereas `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

DONE.
