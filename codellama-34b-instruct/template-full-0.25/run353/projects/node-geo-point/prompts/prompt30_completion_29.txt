  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude + 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 180` would shift the longitude value by 180 degrees, potentially causing the calculation to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 180` would shift the longitude value by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, potentially causing the calculation to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the longitude value, potentially causing the calculation to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
