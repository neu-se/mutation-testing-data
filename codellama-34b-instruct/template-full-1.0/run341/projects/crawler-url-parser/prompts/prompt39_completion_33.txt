  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol && parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:' && parsedUrl.host != 'localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it also checks if the host is not "localhost", which the original code fragment does not do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path.startsWith('/wp-content')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the path starts with "/wp-content", which the original code fragment does not do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.query.includes('ref')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the query contains the "ref" parameter, which the original code fragment does not do.
