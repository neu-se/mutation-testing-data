  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior for numbers that are halfway between two integers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers and numbers that are halfway between two integers.

DONE.
