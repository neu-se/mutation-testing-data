  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that takes an array of promises and returns a promise for an array of the corresponding values. In the original code, `Q.all` is not used, so the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that takes a promise and returns a promise for the value of the original promise. In the original code, `Q.when` is not used, so the behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a function that takes a promise and returns a promise for the value of the original promise. In the original code, `Q.fcall` is not used, so the behavior would be different.

DONE.
