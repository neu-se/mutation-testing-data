Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round down the left index to the nearest integer instead of up, potentially leading to incorrect quantile calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the actual index value from the `indices` array instead of the floor of that value, potentially causing issues with the quantile selection algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an offset to the left index, potentially shifting the quantile selection range and leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
