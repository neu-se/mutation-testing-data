  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be increased by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a necessary operation or perform an extra operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be decreased by 1, which could cause the code to miss a necessary operation or perform an extra operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be doubled, which could cause the code to perform twice as many operations as necessary or miss a necessary operation.

DONE.
