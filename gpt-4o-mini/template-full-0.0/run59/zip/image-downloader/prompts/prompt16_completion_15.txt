Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join('/tmp', decodedBasename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the destination path to always be in the `/tmp` directory, regardless of the original `options.dest`, which could lead to files being saved in an unintended location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + '/backup/' + decodedBasename;
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `/backup/` directory to the destination path, which could cause the file to be saved in a subdirectory that may not exist, leading to potential errors when trying to access the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/[^/]+$/, 'newfile.png');
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the filename in the destination path with `newfile.png`, regardless of the original filename derived from the URL, which could lead to overwriting files or saving them with a generic name.

DONE.
