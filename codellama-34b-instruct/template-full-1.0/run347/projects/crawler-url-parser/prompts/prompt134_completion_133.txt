  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replace(" //default\.[a-z]+$/$", '/', "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method only replaces the first occurrence of the specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replace(/^default\.[a-z]+$/$/, '/', "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method uses a regular expression to find the string to replace, and the regular expression is different from the original one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replace("//default\.[a-z]+$/$", '', "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method replaces the entire string if the regular expression matches.

DONE.
