 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise rejected with `TypeError: Cannot call method 'dispatch' of null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.keys` method would return a promise rejected with `TypeError: Cannot call method 'dispatch' of undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.all` method would treat the resolved promise as a value in the array, which might not be the expected behavior in some cases.

DONE.
