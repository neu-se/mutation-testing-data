  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `value` object, and will throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined on the `inspect` property of the `value` object, and will throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `inspect` property of the `value` object, and will throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
