  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject()` method would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code fragment `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(someOtherPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve()` method would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, whereas the original code fragment `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then(function() { throw new Error("something went wrong"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.then()` method would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code fragment `Q` would cause the promise to be resolved.

DONE.
