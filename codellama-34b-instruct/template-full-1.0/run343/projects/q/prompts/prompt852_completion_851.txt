  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment threw a specific error object, while the new code fragment throws `null`, which may not be handled correctly by the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment threw an error object, while the new code fragment returns zero, which may not be handled correctly by the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment threw an error object with a specific message, while the new code fragment throws a different error object with a different message, which may not be handled correctly by the program.

DONE.
