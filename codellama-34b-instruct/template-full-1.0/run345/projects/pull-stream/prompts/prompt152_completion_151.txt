  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned the `cb` function, while the new code fragment returns `null`, which would result in a different value being returned from the `once` function when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `abortCb` function with the parameters `(abort, onAbort)`, while the new code fragment calls it with the parameters `(null, abort, onAbort)`, which would result in different behavior when the `cb` function is called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with the parameters `(abort, onAbort)`, while the new code fragment calls it with the parameters `(null,
