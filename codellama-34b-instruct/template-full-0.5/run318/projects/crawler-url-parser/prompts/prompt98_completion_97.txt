  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the URL is in the map, while this modified code also retrieves the URL from the map and checks if it is non-null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the URL is in the map, while this modified code also retrieves the URL from the map and checks if its text includes the current text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the URL is in the map, while this modified code also adds the URL to the map if it is not already present.
