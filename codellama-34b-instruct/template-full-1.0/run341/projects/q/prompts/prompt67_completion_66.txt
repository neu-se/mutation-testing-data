  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push(func);
```
This would result in different behavior because `laterQueue.push(flush)` is a function call that pushes `flush` to the `laterQueue`, whereas `laterQueue.push(func)` pushes `func` to the `laterQueue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestPortTick();
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestPortTick()` is a function that posts a message to the `port2` of the `MessageChannel` object, whereas `flush()` is a function that processes the `laterQueue` and `tailQueue` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(func, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(func, 0)` sets a timer to execute `func` after 0 milliseconds, whereas `flush()` processes the `laterQueue` and `tailQueue` objects immediately.
