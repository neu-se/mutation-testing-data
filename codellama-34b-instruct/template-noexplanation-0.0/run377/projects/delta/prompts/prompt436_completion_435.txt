  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete !== 'number'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, which means that the `return { delete: length };` statement will never be executed, even if `nextOp.delete` is a number. This change will likely cause the code to behave differently than the original code, and may reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, which means that the `return { delete: length };` statement will always be executed, even if `nextOp.delete` is not a number. This change will likely cause the code to behave differently than the original code, and may reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.delete === 'object'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate
