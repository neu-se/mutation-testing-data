  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.keys()` would return the keys of the `object`, whereas the original code fragment `object` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.values()` would return the values of the `object`, whereas the original code fragment `object` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.entries()` would return the key-value pairs of the `object`, whereas the original code fragment `object` would return the object itself.

DONE.
