  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a string and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison would always return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a string and `length` is a property of a string, so the comparison would return `true` if `name` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.includes('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `name` is a string and `includes` is a method of a string, so the comparison would return `true` if `name` contains an empty string.

DONE.
