Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to incorrect calculations for the real part of the complex cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the angle `a` before calculating the cosine, which would yield a different result than the intended cosine of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a` to compute the cosine, leading to an incorrect calculation of the complex cosine.

DONE.
