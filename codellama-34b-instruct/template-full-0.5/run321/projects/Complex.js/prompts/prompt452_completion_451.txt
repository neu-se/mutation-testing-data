  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality, while this replacement checks for inequality. This would cause the `equals` method to return `false` even if the complex numbers are equal, which would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) >= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality, while this replacement checks for greater than or equal to. This would cause the `equals` method to return `true` even if the complex numbers are not equal, which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) == Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for equality,
