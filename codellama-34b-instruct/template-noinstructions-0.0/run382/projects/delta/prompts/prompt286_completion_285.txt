  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to skip over a line in the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to go back to a previous line in the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 2, which could cause the code to skip over two lines in the text.

DONE.
