 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one more time than the original code, potentially causing unintended side effects or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not run for the last value of `i`, causing some elements of the `args` array to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++i < length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the pre-increment operator, which increments the value of `i` before it is used in the comparison. This could cause the loop to skip the first element of the `args` array.

DONE.
