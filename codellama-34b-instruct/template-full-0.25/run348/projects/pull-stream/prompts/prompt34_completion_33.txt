  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` element would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the `ref[0]` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2]` element would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the `ref[0]` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[3]` element would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the `ref[0]` element.

DONE.
