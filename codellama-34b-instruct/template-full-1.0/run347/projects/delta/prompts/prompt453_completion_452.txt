  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { delete: length + 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one character more than the original code, potentially affecting the test case evaluation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { retain: length + 1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one character more than the original code, potentially affecting the test case evaluation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { insert: 'a' };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a fixed character 'a' instead of the original code, potentially affecting the test case evaluation.

DONE.
