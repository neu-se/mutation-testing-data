  Mutation Testing is a technique created to help ensure good enough testing by broadcasting various errors in code that evade detection. One can run mutation tests on tested code by replacing sections of the code with malfunctioning code sections, then running the test suite to find out if any failing tests result from the change. The result will show whether the code's test suites are thorough or not.

Considering parentheses () as a suitable operator to use for PLACEHOLDER, Option 1, Option 2, and Option 3 are as follows.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 if(((thisIter.peekType()) == 'insert'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the double parentheses would be redundant in proper Javascript coding. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(((otherIter.peekType()) == 'insert')
```
This would result in different behavior because the double parentheses would be redundant in proper Javascript coding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with;
```
