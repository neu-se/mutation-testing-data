  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array, instead of iterating over all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the end of the array, instead of starting at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would throw an error, since `i` is not a valid index.

DONE.
