  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` is a different method than `delay`, and it has a different set of arguments and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfcall` is a different method than `delay`, and it has a different set of arguments and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a different method than `delay`, and it has a different set of arguments and behavior.

DONE.
