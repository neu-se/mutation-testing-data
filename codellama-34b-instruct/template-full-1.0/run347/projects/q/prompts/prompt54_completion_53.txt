  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit` is a function that terminates the current process, while `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.env` is an object that contains environment variables, while `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.kill
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.kill` is a function that sends a signal to the current process, while `process.toString` is a function that returns a string representation of the `process` object.

DONE.
