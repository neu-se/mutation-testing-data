  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\/+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on any number of consecutive forward slashes, whereas the original code only splits on a single forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on any number of consecutive forward slashes, whereas the original code only splits on a single forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\/+/, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the path on any number of consecutive forward slashes, whereas the original code only splits on a single forward slash. Additionally, the `2` argument limits the split to at most 2 elements.

DONE.
