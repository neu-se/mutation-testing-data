Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.max` would cause the index to increase by the maximum of the length and the difference between the index and offset, potentially leading to incorrect index calculations when handling deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length would incorrectly adjust the index, causing it to move one position further than intended when a delete operation is encountered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting 1 from the length would cause the index to decrease incorrectly, potentially skipping over characters that should be accounted for during the transformation process.

DONE.
