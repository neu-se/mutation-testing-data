  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + 'buggy'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `str + 'buggy'` is a concatenation of a string and a non-string value, which would result in a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `str.toUpperCase()` is a string with all characters in uppercase, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `str` is a string, but `str.slice(1)` is a string with the first character removed, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
