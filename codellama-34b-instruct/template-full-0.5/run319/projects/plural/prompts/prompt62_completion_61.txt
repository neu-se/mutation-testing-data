  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a custom rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria", while this new code fragment would pluralize it as "bacteriums".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a custom rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria", while this new code fragment would pluralize it as "bacteriums" using a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a custom rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria",
