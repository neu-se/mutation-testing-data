  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object instead of using the existing `err` object, which could have different properties and behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `message` property of the `err` object instead of the `err` object itself, which could have different properties and behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` instead of an error object, which could have different properties and behavior.

DONE.
