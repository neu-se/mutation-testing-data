  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice` to extract a slice of an array, while the buggy code fragment uses `array_slice` to extract a slice of an array and then returns the result as a promise. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the slice of the array, rather than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_concat` to concatenate two arrays, while the buggy code fragment uses `array_concat` to concatenate two arrays and then returns the result as a promise. This would cause the promise to be resolved with the concatenated array, rather than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_reduce` to reduce an array to a single value, while the buggy
