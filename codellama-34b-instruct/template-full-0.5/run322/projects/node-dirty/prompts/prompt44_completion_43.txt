  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is a different method than `set`, and it has a different signature.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, val + 1, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to be called with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
