  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.trim().replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces all occurrences of `\n` with `EOL`, while the modified code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of `\n` with `EOL`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `g` flag to replace all occurrences of `\n` with `EOL`, while the modified code fragment replaces only the first occurrence of `\n` with `EOL`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split('\n').join(EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `str.replace` to replace all occurrences of `\n` with `EOL`, while the modified code fragment uses `str.split` and `str.join` to replace all occurrences of `\n` with `EOL`.
