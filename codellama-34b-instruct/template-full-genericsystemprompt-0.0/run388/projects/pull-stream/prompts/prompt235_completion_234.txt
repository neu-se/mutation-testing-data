  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit immediately, without calling the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the wrong arguments. The `cb` function expects two arguments, `end` and `data`, but the `return` statement would only provide one argument, `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with the wrong arguments. The `cb` function expects two arguments, `end` and `data`, but the `return` statement would only provide one argument, `data`.

DONE.
