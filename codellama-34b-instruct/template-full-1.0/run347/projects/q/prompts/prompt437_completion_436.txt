  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array, while this replacement checks the length of the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `promise` is in the `unhandledRejections` array, while this replacement checks the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect() !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks the `state` property of the `promise.inspect()` object, while this replacement checks if the `promise.inspect()` function returns a non-`"rejected"` value.
