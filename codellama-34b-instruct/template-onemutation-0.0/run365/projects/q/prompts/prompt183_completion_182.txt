  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attempt1` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `attempt1[1]` is undefined. If `attempt1` is an array with a single element, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`, while the original code fragment would evaluate to `false`.
