 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) || ''}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for the possibility of an empty string as a value, which might not be handled correctly in other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.set(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value in the `_data` object instead of getting it, potentially causing unexpected side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key, 'defaultValue')}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a default value if the key is not present in the `_data` object, which might not be the intended behavior and could cause unexpected results.

DONE.
