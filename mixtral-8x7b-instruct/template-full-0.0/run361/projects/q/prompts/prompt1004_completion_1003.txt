 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"called", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the string value to "called", which may not trigger the correct method in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
["post", [name, nodeArgs]]
