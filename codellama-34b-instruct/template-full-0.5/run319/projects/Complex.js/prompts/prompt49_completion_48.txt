  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` will always return `false`, even if the argument is not a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` will return `true` if the argument is `NaN`, but it will return `false` for any other non-finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isInfinite` will return `true` if the argument is `Infinity` or `-Infinity`, but it will return `false` for any other non-finite number.

DONE.
