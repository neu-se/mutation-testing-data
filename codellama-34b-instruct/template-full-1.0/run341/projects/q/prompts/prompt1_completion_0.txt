  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `exports` is only defined in certain environments, such as Node.js, but not in others, such as web browsers. By replacing `typeof bootstrap === "function"` with `typeof exports === "undefined"`, we are essentially checking if the `exports` variable is undefined, which would be the case in a browser environment. This would lead to different behavior because the rest of the code would not be executed, and `Q` would not be exported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof Q === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a global variable that is used throughout the code. By replacing `typeof bootstrap === "function"` with `typeof Q === "undefined"`, we are essentially checking if `Q` is undefined, which would be the case if the code is executed in a different environment where `Q` is not defined. This would lead to different behavior because the rest of the code would not be executed, and `Q
