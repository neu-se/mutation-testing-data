  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, which would change the behavior of the `Promise.prototype.post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a slice of the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, starting from the second element, which would change the behavior of the `Promise.prototype.post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array containing the `args` array to the `dispatch` method, which would change the behavior of the `Promise.prototype.post` method.

DONE.
