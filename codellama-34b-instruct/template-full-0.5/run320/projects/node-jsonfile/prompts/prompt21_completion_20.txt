  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, null, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync` method expects the `options` argument to be an object, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options.encoding, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync` method expects the `encoding` argument to be a string, but the `options` object is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options.encoding, options.flag)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.readFileSync` method expects the `flag` argument to be a string, but the `options` object is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw an
