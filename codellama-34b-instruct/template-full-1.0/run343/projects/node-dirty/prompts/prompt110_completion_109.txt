  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, and it has a different purpose than the intended use of the `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because `finish` event is emitted when all data has been flushed to the underlying system, and it has a different purpose than the intended use of the `error` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` event is emitted when there is no more data to be consumed from the stream, and it has a different purpose than the intended use of the `error` event.

DONE.
