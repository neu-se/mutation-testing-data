  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which would indicate that there is no error, even if there is an error in the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `err` object as the first argument, which would indicate that there is an error in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as both arguments, which would indicate that there is no error and no data.

DONE.
