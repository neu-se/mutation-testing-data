  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `||` operator to provide a default value for `places` if it is not provided. This can help to prevent errors if `places` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0.1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses a different default value for `places` if it is not provided. This can help to prevent errors if `places` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || Math.PI)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses a different default value for `places` if it is not provided. This can help to prevent errors if `places` is not defined.

DONE.
