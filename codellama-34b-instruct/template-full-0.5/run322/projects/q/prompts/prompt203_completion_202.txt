  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"%"
```
This would result in different behavior because the % operator has different semantics than the @ operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the # operator has different semantics than the @ operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"&"
```
This would result in different behavior because the & operator has different semantics than the @ operator.

DONE.
