  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);

This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument would cause the `URL.parse` method to not parse the query string, which would result in the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object being `undefined`, and the `querycount` property being set to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value passed
