  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unshift` method adds an element to the beginning of an array, while the `0` index retrieves the first element of the array. Replacing `unshift` with `0` would cause the first rule to be ignored, and the pluralization of the input word would be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes and returns the first element of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array. Replacing `unshift` with `shift` would cause the first rule to be removed, and the pluralization of the input word would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes and returns the last element of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to
