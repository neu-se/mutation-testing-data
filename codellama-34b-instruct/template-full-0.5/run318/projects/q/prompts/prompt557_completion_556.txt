  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter would be passed as an argument to the `verb` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` parameter would be incremented by 1 before being passed to the `verb` method, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` method would be called directly on the `arg` parameter, rather than on the `generator` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
