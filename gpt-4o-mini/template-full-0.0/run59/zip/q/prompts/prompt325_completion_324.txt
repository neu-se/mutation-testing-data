Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fallback function to be called with `null` as the context, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access properties on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the fallback function to the current promise instance, which may not have the expected properties or methods, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fallback function to be called with `undefined` as the context, which would also lead to errors when trying to access properties or methods on `undefined`.

DONE.
