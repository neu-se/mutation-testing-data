  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the loop to execute one additional time when `index` is equal to `count`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the loop to execute one fewer time when `index` is greater than `count`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= count
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is used instead of `<`, which would cause the loop to execute one additional time when `index` is greater than or equal to `count`.

DONE.
