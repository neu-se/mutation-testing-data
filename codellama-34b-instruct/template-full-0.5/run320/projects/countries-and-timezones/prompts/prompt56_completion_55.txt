  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, rather than all properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezones, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the `timezones` property of the `options` object, rather than the `timezones` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.deprecated, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the `deprecated` property of the `timezones` object, rather than the `timezones` object itself.

DONE.
