  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(0)` would return the entire string, whereas `part` would return the string without the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(1)` would return the string without the first character, whereas `part` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(2)` would return the string without the first two characters, whereas `part` would return the entire string.

DONE.
