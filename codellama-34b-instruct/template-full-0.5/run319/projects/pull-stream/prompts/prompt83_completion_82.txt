  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(end, data) {
  if (end) {
    return cb(end);
  }
  cb(null, data);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `read` function to read data from a stream, but this replacement code fragment is using the `read` function to read data from a stream and then calling the `cb` function with the data, which is not the same behavior as the original code fragment.
