 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => zipArchive.finalize()
```
This would result in different behavior because the finalize function would be called immediately, without waiting for the data to be fully written to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => zipArchive.finalize(null)
