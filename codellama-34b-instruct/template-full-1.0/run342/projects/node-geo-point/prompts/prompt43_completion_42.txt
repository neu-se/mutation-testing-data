  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point1Rad` variable is calculated using a different formula than `point2Rad`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radians(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `radians(point2.latitude)` is not the same as `point2Rad`, which is calculated using a different formula.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos(point2.latitude)` is not the same as `point2Rad`, which is calculated using a different formula.

DONE.
