  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code checks if the real part of the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code checks if the real part of the complex number is one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is zero, while the new code checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
