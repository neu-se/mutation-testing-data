  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `makeStackTraceLong` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, exception,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments passed to the `makeStackTraceLong` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self, self,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `makeStackTraceLong` function, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
