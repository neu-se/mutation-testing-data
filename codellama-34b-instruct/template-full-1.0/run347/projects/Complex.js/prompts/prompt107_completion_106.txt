  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a * Math.cos(b);
z['im'] = b * Math.cos(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the multiplication is reversed, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a * Math.sin(b);
z['im'] = b * Math.sin(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is used instead of `Math.cos`, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = a * b;
z['im'] = b * a;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` functions are not used, leading to a different result.

DONE.
