  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_rows
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_rows` is a different function than `array_slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_columns
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_columns` is a different function than `array_slice`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different function than `array_slice`, and would return a different value.

DONE.
