  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for objects, regardless of whether they are null or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for non-null values, regardless of whether they are objects or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for defined values, regardless of whether they are objects or not.

DONE.
