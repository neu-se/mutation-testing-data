  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the distributive property of multiplication over addition, which is not present in the replaced code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the addition of two squares, while the replaced code fragment uses the difference of two squares.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b - b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the addition of two squares, while the replaced code fragment uses the subtraction of two squares.

DONE.
