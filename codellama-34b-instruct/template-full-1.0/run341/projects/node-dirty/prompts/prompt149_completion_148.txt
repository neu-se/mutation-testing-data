  Sure, here are my answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `of` operator would cause the code to iteratively loop through each element in the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for ... of` loop to iterate through the elements in the `cbs` array and execute the callback function for each element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.forEach((cb) => {
  <code>
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would cause the code to execute the callback function for each element in the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for ... of` loop to iterate through the elements in the `cbs` array and execute the callback function for each element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (cbs.length) {
  <code>
}
```
This would result in different
