  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` and `values` are different methods of a JavaScript Map object, and the `keys` method returns an iterator over the keys in the map, while the `values` method returns an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries` is a method of a JavaScript Map object that returns an iterator over the [key, value] pairs in the map, while `values` returns an iterator over only the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.iterator` is a method that returns an iterator over the values of an iterable object, and using it in this context would return an iterator over the values of the `urlMap` object, which would change the behavior of the `for` loop in the `extract`
