  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to `a`, whereas the original code fragment only had `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply `a` by 2, whereas the original code fragment only had `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would divide `a` by 2, whereas the original code fragment only had `a`.

DONE.
