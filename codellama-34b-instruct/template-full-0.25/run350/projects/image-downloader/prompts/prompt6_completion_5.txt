  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not required')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to pass even if the `dest` option is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is invalid')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to pass even if the `dest` option is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.dest is not a string')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to pass even if the `dest` option is not a string.

DONE.
