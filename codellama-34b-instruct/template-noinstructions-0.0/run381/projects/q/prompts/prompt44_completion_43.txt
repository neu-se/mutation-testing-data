  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `domain` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `domain` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `domain` variable is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `false`.

DONE.
