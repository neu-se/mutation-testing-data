  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` operation is different from the `delete` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` value is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` value is different.

DONE.
