  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/^/, '/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence of the pattern, while the modified code fragment replaces all occurrences.

DONE.
