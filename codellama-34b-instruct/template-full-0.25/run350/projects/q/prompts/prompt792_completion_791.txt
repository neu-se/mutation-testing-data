  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to the `rejected` function, which may not be intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to the `rejected` function, which may not be intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to the `rejected` function, which may not be intended.

DONE.
