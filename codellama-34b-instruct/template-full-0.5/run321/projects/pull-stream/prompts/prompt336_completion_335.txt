  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the `cb` function to receive unexpected input and potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the `cb` function to receive unexpected input and potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes the string `'foo'` instead. This could cause the `cb` function to receive unexpected input and potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.
