  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not exit the parser and would instead return a Complex object with the `re` and `im` properties set to NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not return a Complex object with the `re` and `im` properties set to NaN, but would instead exit the parser with an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(NaN, NaN);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not return a Complex object with the `re` and `im` properties set to NaN, but would instead exit the parser with an error message.

DONE.
