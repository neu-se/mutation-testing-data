  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is different, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is different, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is different, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected incorrectly.

DONE.
