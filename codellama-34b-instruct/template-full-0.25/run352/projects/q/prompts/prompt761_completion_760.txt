  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to the reversed array of promises, which could change the order of the resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to a slice of the array of promises, which could exclude the first promise and change the order of the resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([Q.resolve()])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to an array of promises that includes an additional resolved promise, which could change the number of resolved values and their order.

DONE.
