 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
field => field.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new implementation always returns `true` for non-empty fields, while the original implementation checks if the field's value is unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unique.bind(null, field)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new implementation uses the `unique` function with a bound `field` value, which would always return `false` for the same `field` value, while the original implementation checks if the field's value is unique.
