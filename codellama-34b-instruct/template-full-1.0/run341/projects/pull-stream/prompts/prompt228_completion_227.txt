  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data && !test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!test(data)` expression would always be evaluated to `true`, even if `data` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data !== test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data !== test(data)` expression would always be evaluated to `true`, even if `data` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) ? !data : data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test(data)` expression would always be evaluated to `true`, even if `data` is `undefined`.

DONE.
