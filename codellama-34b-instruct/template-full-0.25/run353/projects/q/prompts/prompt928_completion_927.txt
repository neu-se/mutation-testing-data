  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer accept any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer accept any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive an empty array as its argument, rather than the expected arguments object.

DONE.
