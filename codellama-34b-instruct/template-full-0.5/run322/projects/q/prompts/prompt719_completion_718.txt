  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid method for the `Promise.prototype` object, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array passed as the second argument to `dispatch` would be different than the original code, and would cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array passed as the second argument to `dispatch` would be different than the original code, and would cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
