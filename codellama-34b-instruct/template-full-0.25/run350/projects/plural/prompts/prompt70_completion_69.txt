  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the same word instead of the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cell')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different word instead of the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different plural form instead of the correct one.

DONE.
