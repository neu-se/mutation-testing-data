  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is present on the `point` object, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is an own property of the `point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates') && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is present on the `point` object and if it has a length of 2, but it would not check if the `coordinates` property is an own property of the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property is
