 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => drain
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `drain` function to an arrow function, which could affect the context (`this`) within the `drain` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `drain` function, which could cause unexpected behavior if the `drain` function expects a certain number or type of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) within the `drain` function to `null`, which could cause unexpected behavior if `drain` relies on the correct context.

DONE.
