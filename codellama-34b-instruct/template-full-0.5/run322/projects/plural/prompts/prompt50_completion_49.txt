  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching words that end with a vowel instead of a consonant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]e$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching words that end with a consonant followed by "e" instead of "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o{2}$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now matching words that end with two occurrences of a consonant instead of one.

DONE.
