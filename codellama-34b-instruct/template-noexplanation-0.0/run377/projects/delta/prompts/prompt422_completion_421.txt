  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset + 1
```
This change will cause the `transformPosition` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset - 1
```
This change will also cause the `transformPosition` method to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This change will cause the `transformPosition` method to return the same value as the original code, which means that the test suite will not be able to detect any issues with the method.

DONE.
