  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, it will become falsy, and if `cb` is falsy, it will become truthy. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to the opposite of what it would have evaluated to with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!end` expression would be evaluated first, and then the result would be `&&` with `cb`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to the opposite of what it would have evaluated to with the original code fragment, if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has
