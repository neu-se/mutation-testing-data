  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, so `typeof newOp.delete` would return `"string"` even if `newOp.delete` is a number. This means that the code would enter the `if` block even if `newOp.delete` is a number, which is different from the original behavior where the `if` block would only be entered if `newOp.delete` is a number.
