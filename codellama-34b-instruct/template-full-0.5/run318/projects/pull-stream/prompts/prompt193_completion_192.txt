  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` is `true`, the code would return `cb(aborted)` instead of skipping the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` if `aborted` is `true`, but `false` otherwise. This would cause the code to return `cb(aborted)` even if `aborted` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `false` if `aborted` is `false`, but `true` otherwise. This would cause the code to return `cb(aborted)` even if `aborted` is `true`.

DONE.
