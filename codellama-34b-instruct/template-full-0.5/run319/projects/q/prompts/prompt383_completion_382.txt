  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, regardless of the value of `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return undefined, regardless of the value of `value`.

DONE.
