  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the accessibility of the `targetBasePath` directory instead of the `src` directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the accessibility of the `src` directory for both reading and writing instead of just reading.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the accessibility of the `src` directory for both reading, writing, and executing instead of just reading and writing.

DONE.
