Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length by 1, potentially causing the algorithm to process one extra operation than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length by 1, which could lead to skipping an operation that should be processed, resulting in incorrect delta calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iterator instead of the current iterator, leading to mismatched operations being processed and potentially incorrect results in the delta.

DONE.
