  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns `undefined`, whereas `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

DONE.
