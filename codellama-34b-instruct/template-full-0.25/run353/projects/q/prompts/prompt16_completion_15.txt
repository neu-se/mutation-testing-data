  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the code to only execute if both `window` and `self` are defined, whereas the original code would execute if either `window` or `self` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" ^ typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the code to only execute if one of `window` or `self` is defined, whereas the original code would execute if either `window` or `self` is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined" && typeof document !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would
