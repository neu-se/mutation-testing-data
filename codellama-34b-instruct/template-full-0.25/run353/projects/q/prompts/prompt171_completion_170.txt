  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInternalFrame` is a different function that checks if a stack line is an internal frame, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack line is a Node frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if a value is a promise-like object, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack line is a Node frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is a different function that extracts the file name and line number from a stack line, whereas `isNodeFrame` checks if a stack line is a Node frame.

DONE.
