  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only invoked the `cb` callback if `end` was not truthy, while this modified code fragment always invokes the `cb` callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment invoked the `cb` callback with the current value of `i`, while this modified code fragment always invokes the `cb` callback with the value of `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment invoked the `cb` callback with the current value of `i`, while this modified code fragment always invokes the `cb` callback with the value of `i+1`.

DONE.
