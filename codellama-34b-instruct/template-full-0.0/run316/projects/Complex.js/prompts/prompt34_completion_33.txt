  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` is the absolute value of `a`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`. Using `_a` instead of `_b` would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a + _b` is the sum of the absolute values of `a` and `b`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`. Using `_a + _b` instead of `_b` would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a * _b` is the product of the absolute values of `a` and `b`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b
