  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the final result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be double the original value, which would not be correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be the square of the original value, which would not be correct.

DONE.
