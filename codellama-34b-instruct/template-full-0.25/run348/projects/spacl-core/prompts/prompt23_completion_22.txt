  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substring(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.substr(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire string.

DONE.
