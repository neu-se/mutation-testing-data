  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.resolve(op, args);```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` and `args` parameters are not passed to the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the method to resolve with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.reject(op, args);```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` and `args` parameters are not passed to the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the method to reject with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```deferred.resolve(args[0], args[1]);```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is not passed to the `deferred.resolve` function, which would cause the method to resolve with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
