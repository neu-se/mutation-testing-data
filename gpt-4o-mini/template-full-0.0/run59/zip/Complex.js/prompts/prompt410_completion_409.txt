Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the imaginary part is positive instead of checking if there is no imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect sign handling for the imaginary component of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the condition to check if the real part is less than 1, which would incorrectly affect the sign of the imaginary part in certain cases, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is non-zero instead of checking if there is no imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect sign handling for the imaginary component of the result when the imaginary part is actually zero.

DONE.
