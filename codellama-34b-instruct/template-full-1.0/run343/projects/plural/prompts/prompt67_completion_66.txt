  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
~memo(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "memos" would not be recognized as a plural form of the word "memo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'meemo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "meemos" would not be recognized as a plural form of the word "meemo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memories'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "memories" would not be recognized as a plural form of the word "memo".

DONE.
