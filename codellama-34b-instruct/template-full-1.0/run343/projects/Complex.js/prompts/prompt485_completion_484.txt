  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, so the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed if the `exports` object is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `exports` variable is undefined, which is not always the case when the `typeof` operator returns "object".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exports !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `exports` variable is not null, which is not always the case when the `typeof` operator returns "object".

DONE.
