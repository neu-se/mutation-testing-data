  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.domain.bind` function is not defined in the current scope, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.bind(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.domain.bind` function is not defined in the current scope, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain.bind(callback, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.domain.bind` function is not defined in the current scope, and would therefore throw a `ReferenceError` when called.

DONE.
