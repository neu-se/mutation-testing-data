  Sure, here are my three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments that have different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  return this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` statement would cause the `_load` method to exit immediately, without processing any more data from the read stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would close the write stream immediately, without waiting for any callbacks or data to be written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  this._inFlightWrites = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the counter of in-flight writes to 0, which could cause the `_flush` method to be called repeatedly, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
