  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled, even if the promise was rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.notify(progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to notify progress, even if the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
