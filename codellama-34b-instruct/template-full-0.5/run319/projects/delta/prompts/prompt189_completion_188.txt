  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `AttributeMap.compose` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `attributes` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `AttributeMap.compose` method to return `undefined` when it tries to access the `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attributes` property would be set to an empty object, which would cause the `AttributeMap.compose` method to return an empty object when it tries to access the `attributes` property.

DONE.
