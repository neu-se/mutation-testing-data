  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[4]` is not a valid index in the `ref` array, which has a length of 4. The original code uses `ref[3]` which is a valid index, so the behavior of the function would change if the index is changed to 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[0]` is the first element of the `ref` array, while `ref[3]` is the fourth element. Changing the index to 0 would cause the function to use the first element of the array instead of the fourth, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `ref` array, which is an array of functions. The original code uses `ref[3]` which is a valid index,
