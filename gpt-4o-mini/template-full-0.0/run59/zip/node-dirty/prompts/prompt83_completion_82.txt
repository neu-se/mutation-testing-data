Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the first occurrence of the specified substring, which may lead to incorrect processing of the data if there are multiple newline characters in the chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\r')
```
This would result in different behavior because using `'\r'` instead of `'\n'` would cause the code to look for carriage return characters, which may not be present in the data, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.length
```
This would result in different behavior because using `chunk.length` would not check for the presence of a newline character at all, causing the code to skip the intended logic for processing the chunk based on its content.

DONE.
