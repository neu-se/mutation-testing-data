  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while the new code checks if both are infinite. This change could cause the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods to return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['INFINITY']` when the two complex numbers are both infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while the new code checks if at least one of them is infinite. This change could cause the `add`, `sub`, and `mul` methods to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']` when one of the complex numbers is infinite and the other is not.

Option 3: The PL
