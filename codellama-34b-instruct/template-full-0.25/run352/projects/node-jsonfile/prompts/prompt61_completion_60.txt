  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `Buffer.isBuffer`, so if the input is a buffer, the function would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` would check if the input is a buffer, but the function would still return `true` even if the input is not a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content instanceof Buffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `content instanceof Buffer` would check if the input is an instance of the `Buffer` class, but the function would still return `true` even if the input is not an instance of `Buffer`.

DONE.
