Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns `null` to the timezone instead of the actual timezone object, effectively omitting all timezones from the returned object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].deprecated ? tzs[key] : null }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the timezone only if it is marked as deprecated, potentially filtering out valid timezones that are not deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign(prev, { [key]: tzs[key].name })
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns only the name of the timezone instead of the entire timezone object, losing all other properties associated with the timezone.

DONE.
