  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass one argument instead of two to the `baseArgs.concat` method, which would result in a different array being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass three arguments instead of two to the `baseArgs.concat` method, which would result in a different array being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass zero arguments instead of two to the `baseArgs.concat` method, which would result in a different array being created.

DONE.
