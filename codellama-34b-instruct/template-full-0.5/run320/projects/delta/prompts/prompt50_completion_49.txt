  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as `a` is not an object and does not have any keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as `b[0]` is not an object and does not have any keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as `b.length` is not an object and does not have any keys.

DONE.
