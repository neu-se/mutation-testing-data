  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method with a `/` delimiter would return an array of strings split by `/`, while the `pop` method would return the last element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(linkurl_path.lastIndexOf("/"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method with a negative index would return the substring starting from the last `/` character, while the `lastIndexOf` method would return the index of the last `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method with a `Boolean` callback would return an array of non-empty strings, while the `split` method with a `/` delimiter would return an array of strings split by `/`.

DONE.
