  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than necessary, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate one less time than necessary, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
