  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 newOp.attributes !== null && typeof newOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is an object, but the original code is checking if the `attributes` property is null and then checking if it is an object. This change would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `attributes` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 newOp.attributes === null || typeof newOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is null or an object, but the original code is checking if the `attributes` property is an object. This change would cause the code to behave differently in the case where `attributes` is null.
