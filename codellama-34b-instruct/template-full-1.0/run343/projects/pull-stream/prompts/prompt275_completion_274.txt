  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the string "hello world" instead of the stream object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null instead of the stream object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return undefined instead of the stream object.

DONE.
