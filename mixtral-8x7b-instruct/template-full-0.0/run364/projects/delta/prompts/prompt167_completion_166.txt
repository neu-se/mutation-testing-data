 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally advances the `thisIter` iterator, even when the current operation type is 'delete'. The original code only advances the iterator when the current operation type is 'insert'. This change could cause the `compose` method to skip over delete operations in certain cases, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>thisIter).next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a type assertion to treat the `thisIter` object as if it has a `next` method with any signature. This is not type-safe and could lead to runtime errors if the actual implementation of `thisIter` does not have a compatible `next` method. The original code uses a specific `next` method with a particular signature, ensuring type safety.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push(null);
