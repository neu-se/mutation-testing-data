  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance()` and `calculateBearing()` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of elements in the array, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance()` and `calculateBearing()` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the array, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the `calculateDistance()` and `calculateBearing()` methods.

DONE.
