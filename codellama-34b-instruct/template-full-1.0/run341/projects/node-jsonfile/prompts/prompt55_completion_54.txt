  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null, []
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj` would be the only argument being passed to `JSON.stringify`, and the `replacer` and `spaces` arguments would be ignored. This would cause the function to return a stringified version of `obj` without any custom formatting or indentation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, function(key, value) { return value * 2 }, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the custom `replacer` function would double the value of every property in `obj`. This would cause the function to return a stringified version of `obj` with all property values doubled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null, [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` argument would be an array of numbers instead of a single number. This would cause the function to return a stringified version of `obj
