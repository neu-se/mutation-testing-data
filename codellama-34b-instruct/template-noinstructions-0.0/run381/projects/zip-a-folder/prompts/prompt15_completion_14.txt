  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read access, while this new code fragment checks for write access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read access, while this new code fragment checks for execute access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read access, while this new code fragment checks for the existence of the file.

DONE.
