  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches any character in the string, whereas the original regular expression matches any character up to the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches any sequence of letters up to the end of the string, whereas the original regular expression matches any sequence of letters or numbers up to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches any sequence of letters at the beginning of the string, whereas the original regular expression matches any sequence of letters or numbers at the beginning of the string.

DONE.
