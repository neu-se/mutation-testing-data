  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while the mutated code checks if it is not equal. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the compression level is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed`, while the mutated code checks if it is equal to `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium`. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LE
