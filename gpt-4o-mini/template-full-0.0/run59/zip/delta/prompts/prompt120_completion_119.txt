Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to add to the length based on the `insert` property instead of subtracting based on the `delete` property, which would lead to incorrect length calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the `retain` property to adjust the length, which does not represent a deletion and could lead to an inaccurate length calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract zero from the length, effectively ignoring any deletions and leading to an inflated length calculation.

DONE.
