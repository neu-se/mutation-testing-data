  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseLike(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseLike` checks if the value is an object with a `then` method, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is an object with a `then` method and a `promiseDispatch` method.

```
isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` checks if the value is an instance of the `Promise` class, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is an object with a `then` method and a `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isThenable(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isThenable` checks if the value is an object with a `then` method, while `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is an object with a `then` method and a
