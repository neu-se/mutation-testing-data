  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the callback is already in the list of callbacks for the given key, while this new code fragment checks if the callback is not in the list. This means that if the callback is already in the list, it will not be added again, which could result in the callback not being called when the data is persisted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the list of callbacks for the given key is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the list has a length of 0. This means that if the list has a length of 1 or more, the callback will not be added to the list, which could result in the callback not being called when the data is persisted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.includes(cb)
```
