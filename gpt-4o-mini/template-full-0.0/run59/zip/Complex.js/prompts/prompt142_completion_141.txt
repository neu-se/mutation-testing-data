Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for checking if the current complex number is infinite would always evaluate to false, leading to the multiplication of an infinite complex number with zero returning `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to check if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would cause the multiplication of an infinite complex number with zero to return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the multiplication to return `Complex['NAN']` when the current complex number is not infinite and the other number is zero, which is not the intended behavior of returning `Complex['NAN']` when both are infinite.

DONE.
