  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var previousQ = global.Q;
global.Q = definition(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `definition` function as an argument to the `Q` constructor, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This would cause the `Q` constructor to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
