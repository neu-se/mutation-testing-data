  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the next element of the array, the function would return `false`. If the calling code relies on the `true` value to indicate the end of the array, it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of incrementing the index `i++`, the function would return the current element in the array. If the calling code expects the function to move to the next element, it would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of returning the current element in the array, the function would return `null` as the first argument and the current element as the second argument. If the calling code expects both arguments to be non-null, it would cause an error.

DONE.
