  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `promise` is an object that contains the promise's state and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `promise` is an object that contains the promise's state and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved or rejected based on the outcome of the original promise, whereas `promise` is an object that contains the promise's state and methods.

DONE.
