  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the input to a different number of decimal places, potentially changing the result of the `adjustPrecision` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the input to a different number of decimal places, potentially changing the result of the `adjustPrecision` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toFixed(precision * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the input to a different number of decimal places, potentially changing the result of the `adjustPrecision` method.

DONE.
