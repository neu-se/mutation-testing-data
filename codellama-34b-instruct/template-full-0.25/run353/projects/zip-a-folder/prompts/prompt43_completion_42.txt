  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings, whereas the original code fragment returns a single string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method returns a substring of the original string, whereas the original code fragment returns the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method returns a string with all characters in uppercase, whereas the original code fragment returns the original string.

DONE.
