  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Failed to spawn")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error when the code is executed, rather than returning a promise that may or may not be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject(new Error("Failed to spawn"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the given error, rather than returning a promise that may or may not be rejected based on the result of the asynchronous generator.

DONE.
