  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero, instead of `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the dividend is zero, instead of `Complex['NAN']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] && z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when both the dividend and divisor are infinite, instead of `Complex['NAN']`.

DONE.
