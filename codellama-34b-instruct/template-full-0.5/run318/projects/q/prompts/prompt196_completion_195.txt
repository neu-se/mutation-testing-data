  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the first element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, while this new code fragment would be accessing the property named "0" of the function `getFileNameAndLineNumber`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the second element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, while this new code fragment would be accessing the property named "1" of the function `getFileNameAndLineNumber`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the third element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, while this new code fragment would be accessing the property named "2" of the function `getFileNameAndLineNumber`.
