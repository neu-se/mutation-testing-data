  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` is a variable in the function's scope, and replacing it with `null` would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` is a variable in the function's scope, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `basis` is a variable in the function's scope, and adding `1` to it would change the value that is used in the `callback` function.

DONE.
