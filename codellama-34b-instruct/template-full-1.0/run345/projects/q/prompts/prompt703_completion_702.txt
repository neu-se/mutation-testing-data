  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object in JavaScript that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function, while `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any value, while `arguments` is a special object in JavaScript that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object literal, which would not have the same behavior as the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function.

DONE.
