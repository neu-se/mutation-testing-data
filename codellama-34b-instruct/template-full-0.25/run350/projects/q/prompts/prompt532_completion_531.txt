  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `spread` is a method that returns an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `spread` is a method that returns an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `spread` is a method that returns an array of values.

DONE.
