  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` is called, which will return a new promise that is resolved with the value `value`. In contrast, `self.resolve` will resolve the promise `promise` with the value `value`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` is called, which will return a new promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`. In contrast, `self.resolve` will resolve the promise `promise` with the value `value`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(value)` will create a new promise that is resolved with the value `value`, while `self.resolve` will resolve the promise `promise` with the value `value`.

DONE.
