 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1].call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the `rule[1]` function to the current `plural` function context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[1].bind(this)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the `plural` function context to the `rule[1]` function, and then immediately invokes it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(rule[1])
