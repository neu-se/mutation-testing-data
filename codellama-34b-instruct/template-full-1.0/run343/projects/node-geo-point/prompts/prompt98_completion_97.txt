  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(λ2)` is a different function than `cosφ1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.MAX_VALUE
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.MAX_VALUE` is a different value than `cosφ1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `cosφ1`.

DONE.
