  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be removed, causing the `flushing` variable to be evaluated as a truthy value, even if it is not actually true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be replaced with a logical AND operator, causing the `flushing` variable to be evaluated as a truthy value, even if it is not actually true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be replaced with a logical OR operator, causing the `flushing` variable to be evaluated as a falsy value, even if it is not actually false.

DONE.
