  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value provided, while the replaced code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value provided, while the replaced code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { throw new Error("Buggy code fragment"); })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value provided, while the replaced code fragment throws an error.

DONE.
