  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because 'isNaN' checks if the number is NaN (Not a Number), while 'isInfinite' checks if the number is positive or negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical not operator (!) would invert the result of the 'isInfinite' check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the exact opposite condition of what 'isInfinite' checks for. Namely, if a does not equal the real part of z.

DONE.
