  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately without running the `_rejected` function, which would not allow the promise to fulfill if `_rejected` had any side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to fulfill immediately without running the `_rejected` function, which would not allow the promise to reject if `_rejected` had any side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to never fulfill or reject, preventing the `_rejected` function from ever running.

DONE.
