 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cbs = cbs.concat(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `_queue.set(key, cbs)` line that follows, affecting how callbacks are stored in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cbs[cbs.length] = cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the callback to the end of the `cbs` array instead of using the `push` method, potentially affecting how the array behaves when its length is changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cbs.unshift(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the callback to the beginning of the `cbs` array instead of the end, potentially affecting the order in which callbacks are executed.

DONE.
