  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if `ended` is `false` and `end` is `false`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `ended` is `true` and `end` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if `ended` is `true` or `end` is `false`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `ended` is `true` and `end` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `true` if `ended` is `true` and `end` is `true`, whereas the original code would return `true` if `ended` is `true` and `end`
