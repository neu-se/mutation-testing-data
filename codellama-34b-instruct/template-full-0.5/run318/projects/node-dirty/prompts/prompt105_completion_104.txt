  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is undefined, and `this._data.set()` would be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 'foo'` is a different string than `row.key`, and `this._data.set()` would be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key * 2` is a different number than `row.key`, and `this._data.set()` would be called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
