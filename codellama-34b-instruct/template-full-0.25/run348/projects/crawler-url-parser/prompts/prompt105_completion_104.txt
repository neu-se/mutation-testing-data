  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only includes the `text` variable, while this replacement includes the `text` variable followed by a space. This would cause the `text` variable to be concatenated with a space, which would result in a different string being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include any method calls on the `text` variable, while this replacement includes a call to the `toUpperCase()` method. This would cause the `text` variable to be converted to uppercase, which would result in a different string being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include any property access on the `text` variable, while this replacement includes a reference to the `length` property. This would cause the length of the `text
