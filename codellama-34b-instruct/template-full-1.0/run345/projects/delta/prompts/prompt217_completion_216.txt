  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, while `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops[0]` is a reference to the first element in the array, while `other.ops.slice()` returns a copy of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops.length - 1` is a reference to the last element in the array, while `other.ops.slice()` returns a copy of the array.

DONE.
