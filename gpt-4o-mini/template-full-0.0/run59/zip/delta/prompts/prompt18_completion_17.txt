Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the keys of `b` instead of `a`, potentially leading to incorrect differences being reported when `a` and `b` are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => key.startsWith('x'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys from `a` that start with 'x', ignoring all other keys and potentially missing differences that exist in other parts of the objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).concat(Object.keys(b)).filter(key => key !== 'ignoreMe')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude any key named 'ignoreMe' from the comparison, which could lead to missing differences if that key is relevant in either `a` or `b`.

DONE.
