Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always advances the iterator by 1, regardless of the actual index of the newline, potentially causing lines to be incorrectly processed or skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing to advance the iterator, leading to an infinite loop or repeated processing of the same line, as the same operation would be evaluated multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it advances the iterator by one more than the actual index of the newline, which could cause the next line to be skipped entirely, resulting in incorrect line processing.

DONE.
