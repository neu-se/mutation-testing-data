  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol (e.g. `http://` or `https://`), while the modified code fragment uses the `replace()` method to remove the protocol from the URL before parsing it. This could cause the `parse()` method to interpret the URL differently, potentially leading to different results.
