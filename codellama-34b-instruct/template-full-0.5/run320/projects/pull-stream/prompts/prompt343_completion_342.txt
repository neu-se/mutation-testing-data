  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort !== true` is a comparison that always evaluates to `false` when `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `!abort` is a negation that always evaluates to `false` when `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort = true` is an assignment that always sets `abort` to `true`, regardless of its previous value.

DONE.
