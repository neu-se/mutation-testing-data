Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate.call
```
This would result in different behavior because using `call` instead of `bind` would not correctly set the context for `setImmediate`, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors when `setImmediate` is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because using `apply` would require an array of arguments to be passed, which is not how `setImmediate` is intended to be used, potentially causing it to fail or behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate.bind(null, flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because binding `null` as the context would change the execution context of `flush`, which may lead to issues if `flush` relies on a specific context or `this` value during its execution.

DONE.
