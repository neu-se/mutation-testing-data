  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterias')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural suffix "-s" to the word "criterion", while this modified code adds the plural suffix "-as" instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterion')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural suffix "-s" to the word "criterion", while this modified code does not add any plural suffix.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterions')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the plural suffix "-s" to the word "criterion", while this modified code adds the plural suffix "-ions" instead.

DONE.
