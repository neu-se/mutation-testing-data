  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `concat` are different methods with different purposes. `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the original array, while `concat` returns a new array that is the result of merging two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that changes the content of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

DONE.
