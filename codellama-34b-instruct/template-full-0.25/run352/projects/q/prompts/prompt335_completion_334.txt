  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined in the `Promise` prototype, and therefore would throw a `ReferenceError` if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object does not have an `inspect` method, and therefore would throw a `TypeError` if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred` object does not have an `inspect` method, and therefore would throw a `TypeError` if called.

DONE.
