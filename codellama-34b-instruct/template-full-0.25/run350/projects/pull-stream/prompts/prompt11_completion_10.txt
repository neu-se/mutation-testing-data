  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially missing the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, potentially skipping over some elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at an index that is outside the bounds of the array, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
