  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `thisOp` is being used instead of the entire `thisOp` object. This could cause the `diff` function to produce different results, potentially leading to bugs or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of `otherOp` is being used instead of the entire `otherOp` object. This could cause the `diff` function to produce different results, potentially leading to bugs or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `thisOp` is being used instead of the entire `thisOp` object. This could cause the `diff` function to produce different results, potentially leading to bugs or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
