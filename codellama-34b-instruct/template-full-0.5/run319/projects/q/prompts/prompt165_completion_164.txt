  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the loop condition would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never execute, as the loop condition would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1 < lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip the last element in the array, as the loop condition would be false for the last iteration.

DONE.
