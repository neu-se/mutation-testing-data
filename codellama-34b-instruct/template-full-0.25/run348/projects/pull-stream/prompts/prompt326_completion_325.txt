  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with two arguments, `end` and `data`, instead of just `end` as in the original code. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, potentially leading to a different outcome in the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with `null` as the second argument, instead of `data` as in the original code. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, potentially leading to a different outcome in the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function is called with `undefined` as the second argument, instead of `data` as in the original code. This could cause the `once` function to behave differently, potentially leading to
