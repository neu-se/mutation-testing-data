Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` will return the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, potentially leading to incorrect operations being performed on the `otherIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length could cause the code to attempt to process more elements than available, leading to out-of-bounds errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the length by 2 would cause the code to process twice as many elements as intended, which could lead to incorrect state in the `retDelta` or other data structures.

DONE.
