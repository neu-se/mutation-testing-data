  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(self.promiseDispatch(op, args));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `promiseDispatch` immediately instead of in the next tick, potentially causing unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with the arguments instead of resolving it with the result of `promiseDispatch`, potentially causing unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new TypeError("Invalid operation: " + op));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the deferred promise with a `TypeError` instead of resolving it with the result of `promiseDispatch`, potentially causing unintended behavior.

DONE.
