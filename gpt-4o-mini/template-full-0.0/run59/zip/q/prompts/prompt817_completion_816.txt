Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to handle the rejection case instead of the fulfillment case, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore the fulfillment handler, meaning that fulfilled promises would not be processed, and only rejections would be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Forced error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected, leading to a guaranteed failure in the promise chain.

DONE.
