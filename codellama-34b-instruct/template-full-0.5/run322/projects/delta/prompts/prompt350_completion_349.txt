  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` and `op.retain` are different properties of the `op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a boolean property that indicates whether the operation is a deletion, while `op.attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string or an object that contains the text or embed to be inserted, while `op.attributes` is an object that contains the attributes of the operation.

DONE.
