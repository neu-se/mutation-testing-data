  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different key than the original code fragment, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the key in uppercase, rather than the original key.

DONE.
