  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] < 0 && a['phi'] > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is negative and the imaginary part is positive, which is a different condition than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] > 0 && a['phi'] < 0
```
This code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is positive and the imaginary part is negative, which is a different condition than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] * a['phi'] < 0
```
This code fragment checks if the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number is negative, which is a different condition than the original code fragment.

DONE.
