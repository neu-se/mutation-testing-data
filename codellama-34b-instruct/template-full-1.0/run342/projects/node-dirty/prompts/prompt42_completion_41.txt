  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `val` is the value passed as an argument to the `forEach` method, and it is not modified. However, by multiplying it by 2, the modified value would be passed to the callback function, potentially causing the callback function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `val` is the value passed as an argument to the `forEach` method, and it is not modified. However, by adding 1 to it, the modified value would be passed to the callback function, potentially causing the callback function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `val` is the value passed as an argument to the `forEach` method, and its type is not checked. However, by using `typeof val
