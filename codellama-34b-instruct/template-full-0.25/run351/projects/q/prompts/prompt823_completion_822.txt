  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Intentional error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error, but the replaced code fragment would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a promise, but the replaced code fragment would return null, causing the promise to be resolved with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("Intentional rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a promise, but the replaced code fragment would return a rejected promise with the message "Intentional rejection".

DONE.
