  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which would remove all whitespace characters, including newlines. The new code fragment `' '` would only remove spaces and not newlines, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which would remove all whitespace characters, including tabs. The new code fragment `'\t'` would only remove tabs and not spaces or newlines, resulting in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `''`, which would remove all whitespace characters, including newlines. The new code fragment `'\\n'` would only remove newlines and not spaces or tabs, resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
