  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')es\\b', 'i'), function(w) { return w}
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is now looking for words that end in "es" instead of "s", which would cause the pluralization function to return incorrect results for words that end in "es".
