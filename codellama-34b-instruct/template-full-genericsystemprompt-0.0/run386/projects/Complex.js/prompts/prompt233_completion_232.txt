  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the difference between `r` and `a`, while this replacement uses the sum.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the difference between `r` and `a`, while this replacement uses the difference between `r` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (a - r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the difference between `r` and `a`, while this replacement uses the difference between `a` and `r`.

DONE.
