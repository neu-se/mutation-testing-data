  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (promises) {
    return all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        promise = Q(promise);
        function regardless() {
            return promise.inspect();
        }
        return promise.then(regardless, regardless);
    }));
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `regardless` function to be called twice for each promise, once for the fulfilled and once for the rejected case, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
