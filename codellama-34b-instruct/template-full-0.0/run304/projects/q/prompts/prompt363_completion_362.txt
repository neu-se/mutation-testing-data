  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns a progress notification, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled(value)` is a function call that returns the result of calling `_fulfilled` with the value `value`, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
