  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `seen` object property to `true`, regardless of whether the `key` has been seen before. In the original code, the property is only set to `true` if the `key` has not been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `seen` object property to `false`, regardless of whether the `key` has been seen before. In the original code, the property is only set to `false` if the `key` has been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = !seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `seen` object property between `true` and `false` every time the `key` is encountered. In the original code, the property is only set to `
