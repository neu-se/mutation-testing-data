  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is called with a different argument, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is called with a different argument, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` function is called with a different argument, which could cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result.

DONE.
