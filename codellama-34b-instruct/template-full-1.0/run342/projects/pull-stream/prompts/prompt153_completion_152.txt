  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the negation operator in JavaScript, so `!abort` would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `false`, and `false` if `abort` is `true`. This would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort === null` would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `null`, and `false` otherwise. This would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && abort.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort && abort.toString()` would evaluate to a string
