  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to always return an empty delta, regardless of the other delta's contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to only concatenate the first two ops of the other delta, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to always return a delta with only one op, regardless of the other delta's contents.

DONE.
