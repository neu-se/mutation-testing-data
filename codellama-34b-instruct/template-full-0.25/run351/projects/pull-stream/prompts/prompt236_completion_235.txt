  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being incremented by 1, which could cause the loop to run one extra iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being decremented by 1, which could cause the loop to run one less iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is being multiplied by 2, which could cause the loop to run twice as many iterations.

DONE.
