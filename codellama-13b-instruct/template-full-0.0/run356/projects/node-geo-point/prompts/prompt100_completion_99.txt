  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg` is a function that converts radians to degrees, while `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the mathematical constant pi.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg` is a function that converts radians to degrees, while `Math.E` is a constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.LN2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rad2deg` is a function that converts radians to degrees, while `Math.LN2` is a constant that represents the natural logarithm of 2.

DONE.
