 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thes|cris/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regex alternation group to only match "thes" and "cris" instead of "thesis" and "crisis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|crisis/g
