  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Math.round```
This would result in different behavior because Math.round returns the closest integer to the number passed to it, whereas Math.floor returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number passed to it. In the context of the code, this would cause the x coordinate of the tile to be slightly offset, potentially resulting in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```x => x```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would simply return the number unmodified, resulting in the same x coordinate being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```x => x - 1```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function would subtract 1 from the number, resulting in a different x coordinate being returned.

DONE.
