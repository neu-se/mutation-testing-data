  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return `null` if `end` is `false`, instead of the original behavior where `end` is returned unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return `null` if `end` is truthy, instead of the original behavior where `end` is returned unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return `null` if `end` is not `true`, instead of the original behavior where `end` is returned unchanged.

DONE.
