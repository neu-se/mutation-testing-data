  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] !== 0 || this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, while this code checks if the real or imaginary part is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] !== 0 && this['im'] !== 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, while this code checks if both the real and imaginary parts are not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, while this code checks if both the real and imaginary parts are equal to 0.

DONE.
