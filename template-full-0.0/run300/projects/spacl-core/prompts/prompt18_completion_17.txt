  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment is more complex and includes a negative lookahead assertion, which is not present in the replacement code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\*/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code fragment is more complex and includes a negative lookahead assertion, which is not present in the replacement code fragment. Additionally, the replacement code fragment uses the global flag, which would replace all occurrences of the asterisk character in the input string, whereas the original code fragment only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the original code
