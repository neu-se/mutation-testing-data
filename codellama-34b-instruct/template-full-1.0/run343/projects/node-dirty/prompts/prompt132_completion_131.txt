  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.keys();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator that iterates over only the keys of the queue object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `entries()` method, which returns an iterator that iterates over both the keys and values of the queue object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = Array.from(this._queue.entries());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator that iterates over both the keys and values of the queue object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `keys()` method, which returns an iterator that iterates over only the keys of the queue object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.values();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator that iterates over only the values
