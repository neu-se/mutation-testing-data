  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(w.length - 1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first character of the word, instead of the entire word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return only the first character of the word, but in a different position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second character of the word, if it exists.

DONE.
