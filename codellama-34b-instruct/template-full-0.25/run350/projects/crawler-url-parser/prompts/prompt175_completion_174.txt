  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `parse`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse()"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with no arguments, whereas the original code fragment called the function with one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse(url)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `url` variable as an argument, whereas the original code fragment called the function with a different variable as an argument.

DONE.
