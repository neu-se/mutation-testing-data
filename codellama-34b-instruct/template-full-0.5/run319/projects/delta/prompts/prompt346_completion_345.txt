  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `opData`, which could change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the value of `opData`, which could change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `opData` by 2, which could change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
