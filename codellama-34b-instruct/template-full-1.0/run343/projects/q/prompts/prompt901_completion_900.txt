  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isRejected = false;
```
This would result in a bug because the assumption that `isRejected` is always initially set to `false` is not always true. The code assumes that `isRejected` is `true` if the promise is rejected, but if the promise is resolved instead, `isRejected` will still be `false`, causing the code to execute incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isRejected = true;
```
This would result in a bug because the assumption that `isRejected` is always initially set to `true` is not always true. The code assumes that `isRejected` is `false` if the promise is resolved, but if the promise is rejected instead, `isRejected` will still be `true`, causing the code to execute incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isRejected = promise.isRejected();
```
