  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `2` is not a positive integer. The resulting complex number would be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `-1` is not a positive integer. The resulting complex number would be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function expects a positive integer as its second argument, and `0.5` is not a positive integer. The resulting complex number would be different from the original.

DONE.
