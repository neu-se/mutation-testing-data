  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the stack trace would be different as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new TypeError("This is a different error type");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error type would be different, and the stack trace would be different as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the stack trace would be different as well.

DONE.
