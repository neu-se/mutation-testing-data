  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive the `id` property of the `data` object instead of the `name` property, which may cause the function to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, name + 'foo'
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive a modified `name` property that includes the string 'foo', which may cause the function to return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This change will cause the `buildTimezone` function to receive a null value as the `name` property, which may cause the function to return a different timezone object or throw an error.

DONE.
