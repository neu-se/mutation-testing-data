 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the last token in the `tokens` array will not be processed, causing the complex number to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause an array index out of bounds error, as the loop will attempt to access an index that is not within the array's bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will cause an infinite loop, as the loop condition will always be true, causing the code to continuously execute and eventually crash.

DONE.
