  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method would be called on the read stream, potentially closing the connection and causing any ongoing reads to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called on the write stream, potentially closing the connection and causing any ongoing writes to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.forEach(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method would be called on the `_queue` map, potentially iterating over the keys and values in the map in an unintended way.

DONE.
