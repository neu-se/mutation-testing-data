  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push all remaining operations to the end of the array, instead of only pushing the operations up to the `end` index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push all remaining operations to the end of the array, instead of only pushing the operations up to the `end` index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp.slice(end - index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push only the remaining operations after the `end` index, instead of all remaining operations.

DONE.
