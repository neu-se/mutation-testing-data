  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to add the `re` and `im` properties of the `z` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `+` operator to add the `re` property of the `z` object to the constant `1`. This would cause the `add` method to return a different result in some cases.

DONE.
