  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a truthy value, but `null` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a defined variable, but `undefined` is an undefined variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `object` to be a non-zero value, but `0` is a zero value.

DONE.
