  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `href` and `baseUrlStr` variables, resulting in a different URL than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to the `parse` function, which would cause it to return a default URL rather than the expected URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the `href` variable if it is truthy, and only pass the `baseUrlStr` variable if the `href` variable is falsy. If the `href` variable is truthy but the `baseUrlStr` variable is falsy, the function would return a different URL than the expected URL.

DONE.
