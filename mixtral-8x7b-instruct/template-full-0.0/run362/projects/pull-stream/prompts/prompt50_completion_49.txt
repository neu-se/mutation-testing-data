 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `s` is an instance of the `Function` constructor, rather than checking if `s` is a function using the `typeof` operator. This might not catch some edge cases where `s` is a function but not an instance of `Function`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `constructor` property of `s` is equal to the `Function` constructor, rather than checking if `s` is a function using the `typeof` operator. This might not catch some edge cases where `s` is a function but not constructed by the `Function` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === toString.call(s)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `toString` method to check if `s` is a function, rather than checking if
