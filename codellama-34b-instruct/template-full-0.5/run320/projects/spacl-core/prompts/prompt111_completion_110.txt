  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an iterator over the values of the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys of the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(verbs)` returns an array of the values of the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself.

DONE.
