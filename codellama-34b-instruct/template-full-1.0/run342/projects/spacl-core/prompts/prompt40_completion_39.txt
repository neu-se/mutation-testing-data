  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `split()` method is different from the original code, which could lead to different results when parsing the path specification.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\/+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `split()` method is different from the original code, which could lead to different results when parsing the path specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\/\*+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression used in the `split()` method is different from the original code, which could lead to different results when parsing the path specification.

DONE.
