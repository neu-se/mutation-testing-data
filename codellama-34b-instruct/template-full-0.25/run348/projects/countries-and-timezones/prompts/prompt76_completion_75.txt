  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name === 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only memoize the timezone with the name 'UTC', while the original code fragment would memoize any timezone that is not null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only memoize the timezone with a non-empty name, while the original code fragment would memoize any timezone that is not null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name.includes('UTC')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only memoize the timezone with the name containing the string 'UTC', while the original code fragment would memoize any timezone that is not null or undefined.

DONE.
