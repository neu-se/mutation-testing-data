  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be increased by 1 millisecond, which could cause the promise to be resolved later than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be decreased by 1 millisecond, which could cause the promise to be resolved earlier than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).delay(timeout * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay time would be doubled, which could cause the promise to be resolved later than expected.

DONE.
