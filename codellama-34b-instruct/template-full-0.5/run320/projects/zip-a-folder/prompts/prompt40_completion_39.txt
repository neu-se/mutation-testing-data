  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` without a separator argument splits the string into an array of characters, whereas the original code splits the string into an array of substrings using the comma operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new string starting from the second character of the original string, whereas the original code splits the string into an array of substrings using the comma operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace(',', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` replaces all occurrences of the comma character with an empty string, whereas the original code splits the string into an array of substrings using the comma operator.

DONE.
