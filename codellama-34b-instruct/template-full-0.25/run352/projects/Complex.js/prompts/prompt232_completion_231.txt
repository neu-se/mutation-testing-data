  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` returns the cube root of a number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that returns the square root of a number.

DONE.
