  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the latitude value, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude value by 2, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
