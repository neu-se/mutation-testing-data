Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the absolute difference in longitude instead of converting the difference from degrees to radians, which is necessary for accurate trigonometric calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the longitudes of both points instead of calculating the difference, leading to incorrect results in the bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of the first point instead of the difference between the longitudes, which is essential for calculating the bearing accurately.

DONE.
