  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined, while this new fragment checks if it is undefined. This would cause the code to take the `setTimeout` branch instead of the `MessageChannel` branch, even if `MessageChannel` is available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined, while this new fragment checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to take the `setTimeout` branch instead of the `MessageChannel` branch, even if `MessageChannel` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof MessageChannel !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `MessageChannel` is defined, while this new fragment checks if it is not a function. This would cause the
