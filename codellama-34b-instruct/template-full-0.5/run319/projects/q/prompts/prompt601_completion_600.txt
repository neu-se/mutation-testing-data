  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(object)` returns a new promise that is immediately resolved with the value of `object`, whereas `Q(object)` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` in a future turn.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(object)` returns a new promise that is immediately rejected with the value of `object`, whereas `Q(object)` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new promise that is not immediately resolved or rejected, whereas `Q(object)` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of `object` in a future turn.

DONE.
