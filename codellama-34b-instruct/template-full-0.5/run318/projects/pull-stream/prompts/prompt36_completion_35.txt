  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is changed from 2 to 3.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array element being accessed is changed from 2 to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now accessing the length of the array instead of an element at a specific index.

DONE.
