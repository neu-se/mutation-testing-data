  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash and ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash, while the buggy code fragment matches any empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[^/]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that starts with a slash and contains at least one non-slash character.

DONE.
