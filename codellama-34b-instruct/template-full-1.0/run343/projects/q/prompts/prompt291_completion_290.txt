  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.throw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of calling the reject function, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not designed to handle such errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which could cause the test suite to pass even if there are errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object itself instead of calling a method on it, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not designed to handle such objects.

DONE.
