  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `error` is an Error object, whereas `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `error` is an Error object, whereas `"error"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `error` is an Error object, whereas `new Error()` is a new Error object with a different message and stack trace.

DONE.
