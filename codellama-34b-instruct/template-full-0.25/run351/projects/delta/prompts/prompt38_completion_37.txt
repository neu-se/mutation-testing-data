  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different objects, and `a` may not have the same properties as `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` may not be defined, and the code would throw an error if `b[key]` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key]` may not be defined, and the code would throw an error if `a[key]` is undefined.

DONE.
