  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment because the arguments to `String.prototype.replace()` are the same, and the replacement string is also the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code fragment because the replacement string is different. The word "quy" would be replaced with "ies" instead of "ves", which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that end with "quy".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 's'
```
This would result in different behavior than the original code fragment because the replacement string is shorter. The word "quy" would be replaced with "s" instead of "ves", which would result in incorrect pluralization for words that end with "quy".

DONE.
