  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `Q.nbind.apply` with `null` as the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `Q.nbind.apply` with `undefined` as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, which is not a function, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `Q.nbind.apply` with `this` as the `this` value.

DONE.
