  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next(100)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `100` in `next(100)` is a fixed number, whereas in the original code, `length` is a variable that changes depending on the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next(Math.random() * 100)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the random number generated by `Math.random() * 100` would change the number of elements retained in each iteration, causing the final result to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next(-1)));
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative number in `next(-1)` would cause the iterator to go in reverse direction, potentially causing it to loop indef
