  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not an object, while this code checks if `a` is undefined. If `a` is undefined, the original code would return `b`, while this code would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not equal to `b`, while this code checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `a` and `b` are both objects, the original code would return `b`, while this code would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is not equal to `b`, while this code checks if `a` is not equal to `b` and `b` is not
