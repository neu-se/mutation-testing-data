  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` is a hyperbolic cosine method instead of the cosine method used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` is an inverse cosine method instead of the cosine method used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10000 * Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying by 10000 would have a significant impact on the result.
