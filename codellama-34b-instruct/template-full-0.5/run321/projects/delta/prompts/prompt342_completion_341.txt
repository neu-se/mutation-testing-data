  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = Op.length(op);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `embedType` variable to be assigned the length of the `op` object, rather than the type of the `op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = op.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `embedType` variable to be assigned the `retain` property of the `op` object, rather than the type of the `op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = op.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `embedType` variable to be assigned the `insert` property of the `op` object, rather than the type of the `op` object.

DONE.
