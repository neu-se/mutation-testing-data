  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[promise]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `promise` and `promise` is an object, so using `promise` as an index for the `unhandledRejections` array would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `promise` and `unhandledRejections.length` is a number, so it would not have the same result as using `promise` as an index for the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[promise]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `promise` and `promise` is an object, so using `promise` as an index for the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array
