  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, effectively negating the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which would return `false` if `resolvedPromise` is not a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which would return `true` if `resolvedPromise` is not a boolean value.

DONE.
