  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key instead of just the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the key plus one instead of just the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string "key" instead of the variable key.

DONE.
