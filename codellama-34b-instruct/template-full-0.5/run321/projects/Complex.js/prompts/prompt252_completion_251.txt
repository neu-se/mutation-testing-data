  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b)` is a different function from `cosm1`, and adding 1 to the result of `Math.cos(b)` would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` is a different function from `cosm1`, and the output of `Math.sin(b)` would be different from the output of `cosm1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(b)` is a different function from `cosm1`, and the output of `Math.tan(b)` would be different from the output of `cosm1`.

DONE.
