  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reverse` reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the method to handle the arguments in a different order, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter(promises, function (promise) {
    return promise.state === "fulfilled";
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` filters out any promises that are not fulfilled, which could cause the method to ignore some of the promises and potentially behave inconsistently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function (promise) {
    return Q(promise);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` maps each promise to a new promise that resolves with the original promise's value, which could cause the method to behave inconsistently with the original code.
