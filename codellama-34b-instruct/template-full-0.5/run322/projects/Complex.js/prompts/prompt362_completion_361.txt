  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a + 1` is a real number. The `asec` function expects a complex number as input, so the behavior of the function would be different when given a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a / 2` is a complex number with half the magnitude of `a`. The `asec` function expects a complex number as input, so the behavior of the function would be different when given a complex number with a different magnitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a * 2` is a complex number with twice the magnitude of `a`. The `ase
