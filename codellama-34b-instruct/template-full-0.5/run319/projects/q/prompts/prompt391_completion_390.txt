  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressed` function immediately, rather than passing it as a callback to `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressed` function with the `value` argument, rather than passing it as a callback to `then`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progressed` function with the `rejected` argument, rather than passing it as a callback to `then`.

DONE.
