  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path does not start with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if it does start with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains invalid characters, while this new code fragment checks if it does not contain any invalid characters.

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
