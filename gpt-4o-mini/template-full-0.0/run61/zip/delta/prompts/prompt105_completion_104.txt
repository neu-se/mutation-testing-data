Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach((op, index) => { if (index % 2 === 0) predicate(op, index); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calls the predicate function for every even index, potentially skipping operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach((op, index) => { predicate(op, index + 1); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the index passed to the predicate function, causing it to receive an incorrect index value (one greater than the actual index).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach((op, index) => { predicate(op, index * 2); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the index by 2 before passing it to the predicate function, which could lead to unexpected results when the index is used within the predicate.

DONE.
