  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `x` and `y` are not the same, while the new code fragment throws an error regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same or not.
