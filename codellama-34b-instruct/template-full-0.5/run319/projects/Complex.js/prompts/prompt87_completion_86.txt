  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isNaN` operator would return `false` when the input is `NaN`, whereas the original `isNaN` operator would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` method would return `true` when the input is `NaN`, whereas the original `isNaN` operator would return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!Number.isNaN` method would return `false` when the input is `NaN`, whereas the original `isNaN` operator would return `true`.

DONE.
