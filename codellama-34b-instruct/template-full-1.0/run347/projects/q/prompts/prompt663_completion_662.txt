  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the name of the method being dispatched from "post" to "send".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments starting from the second element instead of the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only send the first two arguments of the arguments array instead of all the remaining arguments.

DONE.
