Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic from replacing the last part of the path with an empty string to simply returning the last part of the path, which may not accurately reflect the intended comparison of the two URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "index.html");
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with "index.html" instead of removing it, which could lead to incorrect comparisons when determining the relationship between the two URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "/default");
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the last part of the path with "/default" instead of removing it, which could cause the function to incorrectly classify the relationship between the two URLs.

DONE.
