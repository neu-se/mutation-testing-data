  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, and the new code fragment is `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, and the new code fragment is `3`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, and the new code fragment is `4`.

DONE.
