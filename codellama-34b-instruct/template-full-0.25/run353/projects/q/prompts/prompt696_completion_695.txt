  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the second argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all arguments after the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing all arguments after the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

DONE.
