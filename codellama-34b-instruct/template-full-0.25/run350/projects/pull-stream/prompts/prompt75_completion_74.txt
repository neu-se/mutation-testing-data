  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be passed to the `done` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? function () {} : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be passed to the `done` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done ? null : function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `function () {}` would be evaluated first and then the result would be passed to the `done` function.

DONE.
