  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
itShouldHaveBeenTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `itShouldHaveBeenTick` is not defined, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.notify` would cause the deferred object to be notified, which would change its state and potentially cause other code to execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(defer)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` would create a new promise that is resolved with the value of `defer`, which could be a different value than the one that was originally passed to the function.

DONE.
