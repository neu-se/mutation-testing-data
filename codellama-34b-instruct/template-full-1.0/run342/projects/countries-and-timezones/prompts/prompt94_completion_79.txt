  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong `countryId` to the `getTimezonesForCountry` function, leading to a mismatch between the timezones and countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.toUpperCase(), options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different string than the original `countryId`, leading to a mismatch between the timezones and countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / countryId, options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the `countryId` by 1, leading to a mismatch between the timezones and countries.

DONE.
