  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path = 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the code assumes that `path` is a string, but by replacing it with a number, the code would never enter the `if` block and the `_load()` method would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code assumes that `path` is a string, but by calling `toUpperCase()`, the code would never enter the `if` block and the `_load()` method would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code assumes that `path` is a string, but by calling `toString()`, the code would never enter the `if` block and the `_load()` method would never be called.

DONE.
