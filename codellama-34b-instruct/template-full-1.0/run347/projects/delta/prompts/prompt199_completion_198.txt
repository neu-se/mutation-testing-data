  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops` is a reference to the original array, which would cause the function to mutate the original array in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the original array, which would not affect the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops.map(op => op.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops.map(op => op.length)` creates a new array with the lengths of the ops in the original array, which would not cause any mutations to the original array.

DONE.
