 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the deprecation warning would always be logged, regardless of whether the console object or the warn method exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the deprecation warning would always be logged, since the expression evaluates to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof window.console === "object" && typeof window.console.warn === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the deprecation warning would only be logged in a browser environment, and not in other environments like Node.js.

DONE.
