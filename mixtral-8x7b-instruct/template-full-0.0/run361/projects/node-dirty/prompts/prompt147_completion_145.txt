 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(cbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the `cbs` iterator, which may cause issues if the original code expects to modify the `cbs` array in-place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, which may cause issues if the original code expects to modify the `cbs` array in-place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all elements in the `cbs` array with `true`, which may cause issues if the original code relies on the actual values in the `cbs` array.

DONE.
