  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejecter
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejecter` is a different function than `makeNodeResolver`, and would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` expects a function as its argument, and passing an empty function would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
