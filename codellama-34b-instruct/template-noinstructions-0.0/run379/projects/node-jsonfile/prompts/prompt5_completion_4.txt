  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not being passed to the `readFile` function, which could cause issues with the file being read correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not being passed to the `readFile` function, which could cause issues with the file being read correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not being passed to the `readFile` function, which could cause issues with the file being read correctly.

DONE.
