  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a non-zero argument, which would cause the program to exit with an error code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a zero argument, which would cause the program to exit normally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit` function would be called with a null argument, which would cause the program to exit with a null pointer exception.

DONE.
