  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This change will cause the `become` function to resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which will result in the promise being fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This change will cause the `become` function to notify the promise instead of rejecting it, which will result in the promise being notified instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This change will cause the `become` function to fulfill the promise instead of rejecting it, which will result in the promise being fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
