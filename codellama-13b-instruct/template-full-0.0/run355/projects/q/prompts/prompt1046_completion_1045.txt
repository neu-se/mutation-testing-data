  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` promise would be rejected instead of resolved. This would cause the `get` method to throw an error when trying to retrieve a value from a closed queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends` promise would be rejected instead of resolved. This would cause the `get` method to throw an error when trying to retrieve a value from a closed queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` promise would be rejected instead of resolved. This would cause the `get` method to throw an error when trying to retrieve a value from a closed queue.

DONE.
