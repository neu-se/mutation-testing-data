  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` condition will always be `false` when `data` is `undefined`, causing the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, instead of the expected `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` condition will always be `true` when `data` is `0`, causing the `cb` function to be called with the `end` value as the second argument, instead of the expected `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` condition will always be `true` when `data` is the empty string, causing the `cb` function to be called with the `end` value as the second argument, instead of the expected `null`.

DONE.
