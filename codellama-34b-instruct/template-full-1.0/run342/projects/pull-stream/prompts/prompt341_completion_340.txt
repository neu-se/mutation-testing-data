  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value of `seen[key]` is `undefined` or not, whereas the original code checks if `seen[key]` exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `seen` object has a property with the name `key` or not, whereas the original code checks if `seen[key]` exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `field` object has a property with the name `key` or not, whereas the original code checks if `seen[key]` exists or not.

DONE.
