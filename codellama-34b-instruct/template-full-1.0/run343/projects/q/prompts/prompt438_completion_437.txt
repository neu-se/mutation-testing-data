  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is a different variable than `unhandledRejections` and contains a different set of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is a different variable than `unhandledRejections` and contains a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `resetUnhandledRejections` is a function that clears the `unhandledRejections` array and therefore would not produce the same results as the original code.

DONE.
