Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
const { createWriteStream } = require('fs');
const { TimeoutError } = require('./TimeoutError');
const { http, https } = require('follow-redirects');

module.exports = ({ url, dest, ...options }) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const request = url.trimLeft().startsWith('https') ? https : http;

  request
    .get(url, options, (res) => {
      if (res.statusCode !== 200) {
        // Consume response data to free up memory
        res.resume();
        reject(new Error('Request Failed.\n' +
                         `Status Code: ${res.statusCode}`));

        return;
      }

      res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest))
        .on('error', reject)
        .once('close', () => resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>));
    })
    .on('timeout', () => reject(new TimeoutError()))
    .on('error', reject);
});

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
{ filename: dest }
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
