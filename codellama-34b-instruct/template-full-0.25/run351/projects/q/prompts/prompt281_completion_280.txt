  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not a valid value for the `promise` function, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` function expects a function as its argument, and would not be able to resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` function expects a function as its argument, and would not be able to resolve the promise.

DONE.
