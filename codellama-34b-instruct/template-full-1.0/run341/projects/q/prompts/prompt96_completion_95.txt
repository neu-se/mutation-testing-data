  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index <= length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index + 1 <= length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to stop iterating one iteration earlier, potentially leading to missed elements or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (index < length) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for` loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially leading to missed elements or unexpected results.

DONE.
