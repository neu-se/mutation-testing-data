  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` function would return `a` instead of `b`, which would cause the `AttributeMap` to be modified in a way that is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` function would return `b[key]` instead of `b`, which would cause the `AttributeMap` to be modified in a way that is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` function would return `undefined` instead of `b`, which would cause the `AttributeMap` to be modified in a way that is not intended.

DONE.
