  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `point2Rad`, which would affect the calculation of `r` and the final distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the value of `point2Rad`, which would also affect the calculation of `r` and the final distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `point2Rad`, which would make the distance calculation much larger than it should be.

DONE.
