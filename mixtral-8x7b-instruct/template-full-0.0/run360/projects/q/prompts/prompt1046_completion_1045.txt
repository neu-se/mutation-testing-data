 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would not be thrown and the function would return `undefined` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call a non-existent method on the `closed` object, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the original promise instead of the new promise created by the `get` method. This would cause the queue to become stuck and unable to process further items.

DONE.
