  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a `this` argument as the first parameter, whereas `apply` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` context, whereas `apply` and `call` invoke the function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `arguments` object as an array-like object to the `callback` function, whereas the original code passes the `arguments` object as individual arguments.

DONE.
