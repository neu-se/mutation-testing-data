  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object has a `url` property that contains the URL string, whereas the original code fragment simply refers to the `currentUrl` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object has a `protocol` property that contains the protocol string, whereas the original code fragment simply refers to the `currentUrl` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` object has a `host` property that contains the host string, whereas the original code fragment simply refers to the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
