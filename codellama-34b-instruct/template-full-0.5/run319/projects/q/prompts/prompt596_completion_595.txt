  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as the second argument to `callback.apply()`, instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as the first argument to `callback.apply()`, instead of the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the second argument to `callback.apply()`, instead of the `args` array.

DONE.
