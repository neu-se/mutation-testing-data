  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because the path would be resolved relative to the current working directory instead of the directory containing the script.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"../"
```
This would result in different behavior because the path would be resolved relative to the parent directory of the current working directory instead of the directory containing the script.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the path would be resolved relative to the directory containing the script, but the placeholder would be treated as a literal string instead of a variable.

DONE.
