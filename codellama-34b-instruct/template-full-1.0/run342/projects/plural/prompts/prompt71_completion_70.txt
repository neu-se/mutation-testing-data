  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which would have been changed to `'cellos'` by the `addRule` function, but `'cell'` would not be changed and would be left as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, but this new code fragment would result in `'cellos'` being added to the end of the string, which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, but this new code fragment would result in `'cellofoo'` being added to the end of the string, which would be incorrect.

DONE.
