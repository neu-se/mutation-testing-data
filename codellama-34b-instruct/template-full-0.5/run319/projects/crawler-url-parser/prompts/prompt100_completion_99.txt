  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `URL.format()` method to format the URL, which includes the protocol and hostname in lowercase. By using `toLowerCase()`, we would be changing the casing of the URL, which could potentially cause the `URL.parse()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which includes the protocol and hostname. By using `replace()`, we would be removing the protocol and hostname from the URL, which could potentially cause the `URL.parse()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `
