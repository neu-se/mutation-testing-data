  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` constructor is expected to return a promise that is pending resolution, but `fulfill(undefined)` would immediately resolve the promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` constructor is expected to return a promise that is pending resolution, but `reject(new Error())` would immediately reject the promise with a rejected state and an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` constructor is expected to return a promise that is pending resolution, but `Promise.reject(new Error())` would immediately reject the promise with a rejected state and an error object, which is not the same as the original behavior.

DONE.
