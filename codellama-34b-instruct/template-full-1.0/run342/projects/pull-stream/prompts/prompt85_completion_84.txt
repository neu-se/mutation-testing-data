  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would expect a function as the second argument, but `null` is not a function and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would expect a function as the second argument, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would expect a function as the second argument, but `function() {}` is a different function than the original `cb || function () {}` and would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
