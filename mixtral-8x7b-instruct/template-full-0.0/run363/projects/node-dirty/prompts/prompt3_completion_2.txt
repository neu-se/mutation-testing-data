 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results and false positives in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a common way to represent `undefined`, but it might not be covered in the test suite, leading to potential issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the test would not catch cases where the value is explicitly set to `null`, which might be a valid scenario in the codebase, but not covered in the test suite.

DONE.
