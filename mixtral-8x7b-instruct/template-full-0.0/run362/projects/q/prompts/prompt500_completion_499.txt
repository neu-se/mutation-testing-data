 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the value of `this` in the function being called, while `apply` accepts an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specified `this` value and pre-specified arguments, while `apply` calls the function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Reflect.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.apply` is a method that provides the ability to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array, while `apply` is a property of a function object.

DONE.
