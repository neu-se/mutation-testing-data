  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onFulfilled` handler to be called for any fulfilled promise, rather than just the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onRejected` handler to be called for any rejected promise, rather than just the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onDetermined` handler to be called if the promise was either fulfilled or rejected, rather than just the fulfilled value.

DONE.
