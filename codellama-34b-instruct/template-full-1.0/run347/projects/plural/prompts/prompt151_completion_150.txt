  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the `word` argument to the `plural` function, which would not trigger the regular expression matching logic in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string `''` would be passed as the `word` argument to the `plural` function, which would not trigger the regular expression matching logic in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `' '` would be passed as the `word` argument to the `plural` function, which would not trigger the regular expression matching logic in the function.

DONE.
