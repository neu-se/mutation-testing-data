  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the longitude of the coordinate, while this replacement uses the sum of the longitudes of the two coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the longitude of the coordinate, while this replacement uses the difference of the longitudes of the two coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the longitude of the coordinate, while this replacement uses the product of the longitudes of the two coordinates.

DONE.
