  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that is being used as an accumulator in the `reduce` function, while `null` is a constant value that is not an accumulator. Using `null` instead of `acc` would cause the `reduce` function to return a different result.

DONE.
