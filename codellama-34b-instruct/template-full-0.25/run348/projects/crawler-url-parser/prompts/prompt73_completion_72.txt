  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is not always present in an `<a>` tag, whereas the `href` attribute is always present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` character is not always present in the `href` attribute, and it would cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'href' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the space character is not always present in the `href` attribute, and it would cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

DONE.
