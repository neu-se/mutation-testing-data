  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.log` is a function that returns the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is a function that returns the absolute value of a number, whereas `Math.log` is a function that returns the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is a function that returns the value of a number raised to a power, whereas `Math.log` is a function that returns the natural logarithm of a number.

DONE.
