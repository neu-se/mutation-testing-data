  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*\/?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the last part of the URL path, while the new code fragment matches the last part of the URL path and the preceding slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]*\/?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the last part of the URL path, while the new code fragment matches the last part of the URL path and the preceding slash, and the `g` flag makes the match global, so it will match all occurrences in the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\/][^\/]*\/?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches the last part of the URL path, while the new code fragment matches the last part of the URL path and the preceding slash, and the square brackets make the match non-greedy, so
