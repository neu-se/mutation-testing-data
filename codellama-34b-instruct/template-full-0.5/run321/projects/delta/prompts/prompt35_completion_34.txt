  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `typeof b !== 'undefined'` checks if `b` is not undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would return `undefined`, while the modified code would return `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b !== null` checks if `b` is not null. If `b` is null, the original code would return `undefined`, while the modified code would return `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `!Array.isArray(b)` checks if `
