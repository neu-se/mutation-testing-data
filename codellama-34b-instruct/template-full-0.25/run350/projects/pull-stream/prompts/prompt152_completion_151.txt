  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with a `null` value for the first argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(undefined, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with an `undefined` value for the first argument, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(false, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function would be called with a `false` value for the first argument, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
