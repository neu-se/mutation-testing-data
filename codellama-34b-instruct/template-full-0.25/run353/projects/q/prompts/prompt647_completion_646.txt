  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` is expecting the string "post" as the first argument, but "put" would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` is expecting the string "post" as the first argument, but "patch" would cause it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `dispatch` is expecting the string "post" as the first argument, but "delete" would cause it to fail.

DONE.
