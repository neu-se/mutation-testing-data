  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test 
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` is inverting the truthiness of `test`, which is not the same as applying the `tester` function to `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test)
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, as we are simply applying the `tester` function to `test` again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 !tester(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because we are inverting the truthiness of `tester(test)`, which is not the same as applying the `tester` function to `test`.

DONE.
