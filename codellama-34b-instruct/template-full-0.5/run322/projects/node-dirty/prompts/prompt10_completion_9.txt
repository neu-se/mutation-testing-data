  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to a truthy value, even if the path is empty, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block and try to read from the file stream, even if the file doesn't exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.indexOf('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the path contains a dot, which is not necessarily related to the existence of the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path.startsWith('./')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the path starts with a dot and a forward slash, which is a common way to refer to a file in the current directory.

DONE.
