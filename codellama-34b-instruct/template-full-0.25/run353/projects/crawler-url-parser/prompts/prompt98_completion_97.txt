  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `has` method checks if the map contains a specific key, but the `get` method returns the value associated with the key, which may not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value associated with the key, but the `has` method checks if the map contains a specific key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.containsKey(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `containsKey` method checks if the map contains a specific key, but the `get` method returns the value associated with the key.

DONE.
