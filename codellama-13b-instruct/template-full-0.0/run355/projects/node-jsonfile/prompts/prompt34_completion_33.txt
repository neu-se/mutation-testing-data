  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the file name with a string would cause the file to be read as a different file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace('json', 'txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because the file name would be changed to a different file type, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the file name would be shortened by one character, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail.

DONE.
