  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first rule in the `this.rules` array instead of checking all the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first character of the `path` string instead of checking the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the lowercase version of the `path` string instead of checking the original string.

DONE.
