  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` variable is not defined, and the `deferred.reject` method would be called with `null` instead of the expected rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejection` variable is not defined, and the `deferred.reject` method would be called with `undefined` instead of the expected rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with the string `"error"` instead of the expected rejection reason.

DONE.
