  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression, while `null` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is truthy, while `false` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is not a number, while `NaN` is the result of trying to parse an invalid number.

DONE.
