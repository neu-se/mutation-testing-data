  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed to the `cb` function instead of the `data` value, which would cause the stream to emit undefined chunks instead of the expected data chunks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<PLACEHOLDER>` value would be passed to the `cb` function instead of the `data` value, which would cause the stream to emit the placeholder value instead of the expected data chunks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed to the `cb` function instead of the `data` value, which would cause the stream to emit null chunks instead of the expected data chunks.

DONE.
