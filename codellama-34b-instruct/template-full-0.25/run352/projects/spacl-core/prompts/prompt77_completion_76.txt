  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array containing only the elements that match the given predicate, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array containing the results of calling the given function on each element of the original array, whereas the original code fragment returns a reference to the same array.

DONE.
