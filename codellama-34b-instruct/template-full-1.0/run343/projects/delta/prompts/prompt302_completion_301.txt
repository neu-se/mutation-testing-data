  Sure, here are three potential options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over the first op and retrieve the attributes of the second op instead. This could have unintended consequences in the `eachLine` method, as it may not be able to operate correctly with the modified op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherLine, otherIter.next(1).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different iterator (otherIter) to retrieve the attributes of the next op. This could have unintended consequences in the `eachLine` method, as it may not be able to operate correctly with the modified op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the `line` and
