  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the source promise instead of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with information about the promise instead of the resolved value.

DONE.
