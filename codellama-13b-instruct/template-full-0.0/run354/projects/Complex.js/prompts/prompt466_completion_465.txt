  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the code to execute when `b` is not equal to 0, rather than when it is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check if `a` is equal to 0, rather than checking if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be changed to check if the absolute value of `b` is less than the `EPSILON` constant, rather than checking if `b` is equal to 0.

DONE.
