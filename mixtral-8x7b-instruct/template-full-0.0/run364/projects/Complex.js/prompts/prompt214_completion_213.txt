 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator of the division would always be 1, which is not the original intent of the code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the current complex number instead of the second argument of the 'pow' method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random factor in the calculation, making the result unpredictable and inconsistent.

DONE.
