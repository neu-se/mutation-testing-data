  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is incremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if the value of `task` is used later in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is multiplied by 2, which could cause the program to behave differently if the value of `task` is used later in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is decremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if the value of `task` is used later in the program.

DONE.
