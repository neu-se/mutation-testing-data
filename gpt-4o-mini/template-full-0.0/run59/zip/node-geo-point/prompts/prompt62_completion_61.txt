Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using `sin` instead of `cos` would change the calculation of the x component in the bearing formula, leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because substituting `cos` with `tan` would alter the mathematical relationship in the calculation, potentially resulting in undefined behavior or incorrect values when the angle is at certain points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `cos` with a constant value of `1` would ignore the actual cosine of the angle, leading to incorrect calculations of the bearing, as it would not account for the angle's effect on the x component.

DONE.
