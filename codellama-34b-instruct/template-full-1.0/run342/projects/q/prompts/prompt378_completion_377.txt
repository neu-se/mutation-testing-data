  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.thenResolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.thenResolve()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of `callback`, while `Q(promise).tap()` returns `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(callback)` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of `callback`, while `Q(promise).tap()` returns `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Deferred.when(promise, callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Deferred.when()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of `callback`, while `Q(promise).tap()` returns `promise`.

DONE.
