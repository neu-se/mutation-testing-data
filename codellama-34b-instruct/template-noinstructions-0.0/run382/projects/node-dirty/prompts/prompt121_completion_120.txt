  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event only when `this._inFlightWrites` is 0, while the new code emits it with the current value of `this._inFlightWrites`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event only when `this._queue.size` is 0, while the new code emits it with the current value of `this._queue.size`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event only when `this._data.size` is 0, while the new
