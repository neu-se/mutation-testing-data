  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() || z['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for infinity, but this code checks for finiteness.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for infinity, but this code checks for NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either value is infinite, but this code checks if both values are infinite.

DONE.
