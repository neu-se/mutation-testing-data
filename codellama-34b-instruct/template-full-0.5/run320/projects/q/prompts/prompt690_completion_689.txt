  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined`, and could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would slice the `arguments` array starting from the second element, instead of from the first element. This could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)` would slice the `arguments` array to only include the first element, instead of slicing it to include all elements. This could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the returned promise.
