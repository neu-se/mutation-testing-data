  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `Q` is a truthy value. This means that the promise returned by `ninvoke` would be resolved with `null`, instead of `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid receiver for the `dispatch` method, and it is different from `Q`. This would cause an error to be thrown, and the promise returned by `ninvoke` would be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and `Q` is a truthy value. This means that the promise returned by `ninvoke` would be resolved with `0`, instead of `Q`.

DONE.
