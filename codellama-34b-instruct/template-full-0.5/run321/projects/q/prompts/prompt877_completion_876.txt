  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array containing the elements of `args` from the second element onwards, rather than the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new array containing the elements of `args` followed by the elements of an empty array, rather than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== undefined; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return a new array containing only the elements of `args` that are not `undefined`, rather than the original array.

DONE.
