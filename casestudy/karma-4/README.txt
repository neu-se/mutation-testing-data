The version of Karma in Bug.js does not seem to build anymore, but the same file with the fixed bug
still occurs in the latest version on Karma that we downloaded from GitHub on 12/30/2024.  After
downloading, run "npm install" and then "npm run test"

Running the tests with the fixed code with "npm run test" results in 588 passing tests.
Replacing the fixed code with the original code results in 587 passing tests.
