  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being incremented, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being converted to uppercase, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is being reversed, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
