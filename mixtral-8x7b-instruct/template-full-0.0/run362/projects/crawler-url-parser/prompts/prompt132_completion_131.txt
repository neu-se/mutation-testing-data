 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index|default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match both "/index.*" and "/default.*" patterns, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\.[a-z]+|$/
