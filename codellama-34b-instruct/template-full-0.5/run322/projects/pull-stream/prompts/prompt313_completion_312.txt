  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, `null` is used as a sentinel value to indicate that the stream has ended, and `null` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, `null` is used as a sentinel value to indicate that the stream has ended, and `0` is not equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that is not equal to any other value, including `null`. In the original code, `null` is used as a sentinel value to indicate that the stream has ended, and `NaN`
