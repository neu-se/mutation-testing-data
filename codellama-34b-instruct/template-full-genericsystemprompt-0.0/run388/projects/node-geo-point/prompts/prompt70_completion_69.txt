  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses the modulo operator to wrap the angle around to the range of 0 to 360 degrees. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees, but the new code fragment uses the modulo operator to wrap the angle around to the range of 0 to 180 degrees. This would cause the bearing calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 90) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
