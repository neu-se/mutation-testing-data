  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the given number, while `Math.round` returns the closest integer to the given number. If the given number is negative, `Math.ceil` will round down, while `Math.round` will round up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the given number, while `Math.round` returns the closest integer to the given number. If the given number is negative, `Math.floor` will round down, while `Math.round` will round up.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` returns the integer part of the given number, while `Math.round` returns the closest integer to the given number. If the given
