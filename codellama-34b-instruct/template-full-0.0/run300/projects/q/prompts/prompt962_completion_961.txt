  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be the length of the `arguments` object instead of `0`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `null` instead of `0`, which would cause the function to return a different slice of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
