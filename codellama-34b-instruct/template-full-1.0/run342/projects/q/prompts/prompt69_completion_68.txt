  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + channel.port2.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the message to be sent with a different postMessage operation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function with a different `this` context than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(channel.port2.postMessage)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Promise` constructor would create a new promise object with a different state than the original code.

DONE.
