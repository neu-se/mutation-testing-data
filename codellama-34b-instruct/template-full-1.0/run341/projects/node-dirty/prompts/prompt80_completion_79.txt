  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is passed as an error argument, which could cause the code to behave differently, especially if it is expected that the argument is actually an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ error: err }
```
This would result in different behavior because an object with a single property `error` is passed as an error argument, which could cause the code to behave differently, especially if it is expected that the argument is actually an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because only the error message is passed as an error argument, which could cause the code to behave differently, especially if it is expected that the argument is actually an error object.

DONE.
