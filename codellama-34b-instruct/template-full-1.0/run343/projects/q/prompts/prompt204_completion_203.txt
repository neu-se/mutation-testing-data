  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"QFileName"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `QFileName` identifier is not defined in the current scope, which would lead to a reference error and cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"qFileName"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qFileName` identifier is not defined in the current scope, which would lead to a reference error and cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn
```
This would result in different behavior because `fn` is a reserved word in JavaScript, which would lead to a syntax error and cause the code to fail.

DONE.
