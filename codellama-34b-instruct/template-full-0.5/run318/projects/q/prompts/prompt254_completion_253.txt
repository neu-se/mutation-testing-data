  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `message` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `message` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(new Promise())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new promise to the end of the `message` array, which would change the length of the array and the order of the elements.

DONE.
