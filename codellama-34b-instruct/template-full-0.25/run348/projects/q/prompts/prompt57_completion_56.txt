  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that takes no arguments, and passing an argument of `1` would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(tail)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tail` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
