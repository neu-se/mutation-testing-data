  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the second element of the `rule` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the third element of the `rule` array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[Math.floor(Math.random() * rules.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a random element from the `rule` array instead of the first.

DONE.
