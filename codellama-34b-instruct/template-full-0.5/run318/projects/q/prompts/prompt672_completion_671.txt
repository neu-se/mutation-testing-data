  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply` is a different method than `Q` and it may have a different implementation that could lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` is a different method than `Q` and it may have a different implementation that could lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fbind(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` is a different method than `Q` and it may have a different implementation that could lead to different results.

DONE.
