  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args + args` would concatenate the `args` array with itself, resulting in a new array with twice the length of the original `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `args * 2` would multiply the `args` array by 2, resulting in a new array with twice the length of the original `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat(args)` would concatenate the `args` array with itself, resulting in a new array with twice the length of the original `args` array.

DONE.
