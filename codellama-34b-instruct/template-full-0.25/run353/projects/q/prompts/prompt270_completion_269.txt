  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with `null` instead of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with `undefined` instead of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called with the string `"error"` instead of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different value than expected.

DONE.
