  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is expecting a boolean value as the first argument, but `data` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is expecting a boolean value as the first argument, but `null` is not a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function is expecting a boolean value as the first argument, but `true` is a boolean literal.

DONE.
