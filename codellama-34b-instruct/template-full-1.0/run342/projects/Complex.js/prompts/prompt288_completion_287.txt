  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh(b)` is a different function than `Math.sin(a)` and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b)` is a different function than `Math.cos(a)` and would produce a different result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(b)` is a different function than `Math.sin(a)` and would produce a different result for the same input.

DONE.
