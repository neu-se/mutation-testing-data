  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This will cause the `sec` function to return the wrong value, as it will be using the cosine function instead of the sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This will cause the `sec` function to return the wrong value, as it will be using the tangent function instead of the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This will cause the `sec` function to return the wrong value, as it will be using the arcsine function instead of the sine function.

DONE.
