 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would cause a division by zero error when `a` is equal to 0, while the original code fragment always evaluates to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would calculate the arctangent of `b/a`, while the original code fragment always evaluates to 1. This could lead to incorrect results when `b` is not equal to 0 and `a` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would always evaluate to 0, while the original code fragment always evaluates to 1. This could lead to incorrect results in the `acot` method.

DONE.
