  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the existence of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable, while this replacement checks for the variable being null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the existence of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable, while this replacement checks for the variable being an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber[0] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the existence of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable, while this replacement checks for the variable being an array with an undefined first element.

DONE.
