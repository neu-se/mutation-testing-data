  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle, while the new code fragment calculates the sine of the angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle, while the new code fragment calculates the tangent of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the angle, while the new code fragment calculates the arccosine of the angle.

DONE.
