  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `transform` is a method that applies a change to the current instance, whereas `transformPosition` is a method that returns a transformed position based on a given index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert` is a method that reverses the operations of the current instance, whereas `transformPosition` is a method that transforms the position of the current instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(this.ops.slice().reverse()).transform
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new instance of `Delta` with the operations in reverse order and then apply the transformation to the new instance.

DONE.
