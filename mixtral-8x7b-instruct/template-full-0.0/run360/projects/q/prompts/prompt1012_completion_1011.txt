 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object with the default settler function, which doesn't reject the promise even if an error occurs. The original code uses `defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)` to pass a custom error-handling settler function to the `defer` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the `resolve` method instead of creating a new function (`deferred.resolve`). The original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which returns a function that wrap
