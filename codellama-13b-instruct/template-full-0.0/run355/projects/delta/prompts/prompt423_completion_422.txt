  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has higher precedence than the `-` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `length + (index - offset)`, which is not the same as the original expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has higher precedence than the `+` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `length - (index + offset)`, which is not the same as the original expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has higher precedence than the `-` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `length * (index - offset)`, which is not the same as the original expression.

DONE.
