  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the result of the `Math.expm1()` function, which is used to calculate the complex exponent and subtract one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the result of the `Math.expm1()` function, which is used to calculate the complex exponent and subtract one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the result of the `Math.expm1()` function, which is used to calculate the complex exponent and subtract one.

DONE.
