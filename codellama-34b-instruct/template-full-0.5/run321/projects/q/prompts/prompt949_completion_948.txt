  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different behavior when it comes to handling the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function that is bound to a specific context, while `call` and `apply` do not change the context of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` returns a new function that is bound to the global object, while `call` and `apply` do not change the context of the function.

DONE.
