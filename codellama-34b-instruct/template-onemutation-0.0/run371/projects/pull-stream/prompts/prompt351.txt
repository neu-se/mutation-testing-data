Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
var prop = require('./prop')

function id (e) { return e }

module.exports = function tester (test) {
  return (
    'object' === typeof test && 'function' === typeof test.test //regexp
    ? function (data) { return test.test(data) }
    : prop (<PLACEHOLDER>) || id
  )
}

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
test
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
