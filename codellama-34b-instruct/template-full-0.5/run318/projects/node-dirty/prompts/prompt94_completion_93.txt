  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is the inverse of `JSON.parse`, and it would cause the code to write the data in a different format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a constructor function that creates a number object, and it would cause the code to write a different type of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` generates a random number, and it would cause the code to write a different value.

DONE.
