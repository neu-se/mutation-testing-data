  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/. * /, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match a pattern and replace it with an empty string, while the modified code fragment uses a different regular expression that matches a different pattern and replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#. *$/ /, {exmaple: 'example', '/', '!@#$%^&*()â€”+=[].,}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match a pattern and replace it with an empty string, while the modified code fragment uses a different regular expression that matches a different pattern and replaces it with a string of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/ /, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match a pattern and replace it with an empty string, while the modified code fragment uses a different
