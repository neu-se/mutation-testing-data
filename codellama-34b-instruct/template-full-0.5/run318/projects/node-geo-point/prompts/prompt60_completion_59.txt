  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` and `sin` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `sin` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `sin` have different outputs for the same input.

DONE.
