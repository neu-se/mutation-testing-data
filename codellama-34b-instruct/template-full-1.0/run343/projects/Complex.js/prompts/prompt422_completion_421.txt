  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this.re === 0) {
    return new Complex(0, Math.PI);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking whether `b` was equal to 0, not `re`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']) {
    return new Complex(Infinity, Infinity);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking whether `a` was equal to 0, not whether the complex number was infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['equals'](new Complex(0, 0))) {
    return new Complex(0, Math.PI);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking whether `b` was equal to 0, not whether the complex number was equal to 0.

DONE.
