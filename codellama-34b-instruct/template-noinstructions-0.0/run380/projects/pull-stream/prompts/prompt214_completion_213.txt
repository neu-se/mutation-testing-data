  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `null`, which is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `undefined`, which is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is truthy, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `false`, which is falsy.

DONE.
