  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `rad2deg` is not defined in the code snippet provided, and the code would fail to compile.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `deg2rad` is not defined in the code snippet provided, and the code would fail to compile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `rad2deg` is not defined in the code snippet provided, and the code would fail to compile.

DONE.
