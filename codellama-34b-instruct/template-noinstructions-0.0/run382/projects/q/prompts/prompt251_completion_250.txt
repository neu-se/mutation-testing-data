  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasStacks` variable is negated, which would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to `undefined` even if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasStacks` variable is added to the `Q.longStackSupport` variable using the logical OR operator, which would cause the `promise.stack` property to be set to a non-empty string even if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasStacks` variable is added to the `Q.longStackSupport` variable using the logical AND operator, which would cause the `promise.
