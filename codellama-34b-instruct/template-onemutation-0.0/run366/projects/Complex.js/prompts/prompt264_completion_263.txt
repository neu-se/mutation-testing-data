  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` as the second argument to `Math.atan2()`, which is the tangent of the angle between the two vectors, while the replaced code fragment uses `a` as the second argument, which is the tangent of the angle between the two vectors.

DONE.
