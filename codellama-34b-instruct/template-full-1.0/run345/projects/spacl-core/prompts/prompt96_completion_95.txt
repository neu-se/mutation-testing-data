  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

[ policy.name, policy ]

This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with two elements, `policy.name` and `policy`, instead of using the `policy` object as the value for the key `policy.name`. The `PolicyMap` constructor would still work correctly, but other parts of the code that rely on the `PolicyMap` instance may not work as expected.
