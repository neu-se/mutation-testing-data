  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` property of `otherOp` to be used instead of the `retain` property, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` property of `thisOp` to be used instead of the `retain` property, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property of `otherOp` to be `null`, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
