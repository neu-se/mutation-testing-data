 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the latitude as a positive value, which could lead to incorrect distance calculations for southbound points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the cosine function to the longitude instead of the latitude, which would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the cosine of zero (1) for the latitude of the second point, which would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

DONE.
