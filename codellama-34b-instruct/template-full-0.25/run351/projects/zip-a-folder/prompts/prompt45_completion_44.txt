  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string `src` with the number `1`, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string `src` to uppercase, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a substring of the original string `src`, starting from the second character, resulting in a different output than the original code fragment.

DONE.
