  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is the negation of `===`, so `row.val !== undefined` would return true if `row.val` is not undefined, rather than if it is undefined, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `== null` checks for `null` or `undefined`, rather than just `undefined`, which is the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `=== null` checks for `null`, rather than `undefined`, which is the original behavior.

DONE.
