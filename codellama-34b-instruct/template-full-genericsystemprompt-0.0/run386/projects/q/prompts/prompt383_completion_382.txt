  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is not defined for the `callback` object, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined for the `callback` object, and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined for the `callback` object, and would throw an error.

DONE.
