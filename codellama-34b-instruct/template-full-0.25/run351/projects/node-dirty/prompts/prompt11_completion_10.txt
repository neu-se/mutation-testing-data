  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from a map, whereas `get` is a method that returns the value associated with a key in a map. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the code to remove the key-value pair from the map instead of retrieving the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets the value associated with a key in a map, whereas `get` is a method that returns the value associated with a key in a map. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set the value associated with the key to an empty array instead of retrieving the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear()
```
This would result in
