 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would expect the input object to have a `longitude` property twice, which is not the case in the original implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'altitude'
