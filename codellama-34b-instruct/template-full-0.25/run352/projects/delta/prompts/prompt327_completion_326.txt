  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.delete` would delete the entire length of the `baseOp`, whereas `inverted.push` would push the `baseOp` as a new element in the `inverted` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(baseOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.retain` would retain the entire length of the `baseOp`, whereas `inverted.push` would push the `baseOp` as a new element in the `inverted` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(baseOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.push` would push the `insert` property of the `baseOp` as a new element in the `inverted
