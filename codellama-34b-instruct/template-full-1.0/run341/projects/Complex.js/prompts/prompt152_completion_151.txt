  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof z !== 'object') {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object `z` is not of type object, and if so, return `Complex['INFINITY']`. This change would affect the behavior of the code because it would cause the `if` statement that checks for `Infinity` to always evaluate to true if `z` is not an object, which could cause the code to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if ((z['re'] === 0) || (z['im'] === 0)) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either the real part or the imaginary part of the object `z` is 0, and if so, return `Complex['INFINITY']`. This change would affect the behavior of the code because it would cause the `if` statement that checks for `In
