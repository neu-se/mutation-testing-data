  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of removing the first reported unhandled rejection, it would remove the last reported unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of removing a reported unhandled rejection, it would do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of removing a reported unhandled rejection, it would remove all reported unhandled rejections.

DONE.
