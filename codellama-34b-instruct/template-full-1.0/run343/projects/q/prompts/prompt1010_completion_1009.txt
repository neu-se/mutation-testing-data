  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `arguments` with `1` as the second parameter, which means it is accessing the second argument passed to the function. Changing this to `2` would access the third argument instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.pop.apply(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `arguments` with `1` as the second parameter, which means it is accessing the second argument passed to the function. However, this new code fragment is using `pop` method of array prototype to retrieve the last element of the `arguments` object, which means it would access the last argument passed to the function instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.callee.caller
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `arguments` with `1` as the second parameter, which means it is accessing
