Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `Buffer.isBuffer` will always return `false`, causing the content to be treated as a string regardless of its actual type, which may lead to unexpected behavior when processing non-string inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length
```
This would result in different behavior because using `content.length` will evaluate to a number, which will always return `false` for `Buffer.isBuffer`, leading to the assumption that `content` is not a buffer even if it is, thus potentially causing incorrect handling of buffer data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `content.toString()` directly without specifying the encoding will convert the content to a string using the default encoding, which may not be 'utf8', potentially resulting in data loss or corruption for non-UTF-8 encoded buffers.

DONE.
