  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to use the wrong op when composing with a retain, which could result in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to use the wrong op when composing with a retain, which could result in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to use the wrong op when composing with a retain, which could result in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
