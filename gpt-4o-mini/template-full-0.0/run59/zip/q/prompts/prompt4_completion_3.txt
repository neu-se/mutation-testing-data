Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export `null` instead of the intended `definition`, leading to potential runtime errors when trying to use the Q API.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would result in the module exporting `undefined`, which would break any code that expects the Q API to be available, leading to failures when attempting to call Q methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module to export a string instead of the `definition`, which would not provide the expected functionality of the Q API, potentially causing type errors in the consuming code.

DONE.
