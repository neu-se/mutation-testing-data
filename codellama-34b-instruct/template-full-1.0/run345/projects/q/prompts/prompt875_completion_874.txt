  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called `deferred.nodeifyWithTrace()` to resolve the promise, while the suggested replacement calls `deferred.reject()` to reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passed `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` as an argument to `Q.reject()`, while the suggested replacement directly calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` without passing anything to `Q.reject()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code did not specify an error message, while the suggested replacement specifies an empty error message that could potentially cause differences in the handling of the rejection.

DONE.
