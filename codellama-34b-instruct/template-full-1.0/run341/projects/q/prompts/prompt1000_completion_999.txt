  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will cause the promise to reject, while `deferred.resolve` will cause the promise to resolve, which could result in unexpected behavior elsewhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will call the `deferred.reject` method, while `nodeback` will call the `nodeback` function, which could result in unexpected behavior elsewhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` will cause the promise to reject, while `undefined` will cause the promise to resolve, which could result in unexpected behavior elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
