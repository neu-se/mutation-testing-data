  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus` and `minus` variables are not being used correctly. The original code fragment checks if the `plus` and `minus` variables are equal to 0, which is a valid check to determine if the string is a valid number. However, replacing the `===` operator with `==` would allow the code to pass even if the `plus` and `minus` variables are not equal to 0, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 && !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isNaN(c)` check is being performed before the `plus + minus === 0` check. This would allow the code to pass even if the `plus` and `minus` variables are not equal to 0, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
