  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only execute if there are at least two ops in the other delta, whereas the original code would execute if there is at least one op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only execute if there are no ops in the other delta, whereas the original code would execute if there is at least one op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only execute if the number of ops in the other delta is even, whereas the original code would execute if there is at least one op.

DONE.
