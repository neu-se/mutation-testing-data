  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a new `Error` object instead of the original `reason` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.fulfill` method is called with `undefined` instead of the original `reason` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(resolvedPromise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a different object (`resolvedPromise`) instead of the original `reason` object.

DONE.
