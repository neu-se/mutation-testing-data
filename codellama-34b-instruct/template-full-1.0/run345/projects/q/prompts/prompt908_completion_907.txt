  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice the first two elements of the `args` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice the middle elements of the `args` array, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(-1, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `args` array starting from the end, rather than the beginning.

DONE.
