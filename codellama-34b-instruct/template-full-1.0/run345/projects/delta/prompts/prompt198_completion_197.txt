  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the previous op in the composition instead of the last op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0], newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first op in the composition instead of the last op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = (delta.ops.length > 1) ? delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2] : null;
if (otherOp !== null) {
    newOp = otherOp;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the previous op in the composition if it exists, instead of always using the last op.

DONE.
