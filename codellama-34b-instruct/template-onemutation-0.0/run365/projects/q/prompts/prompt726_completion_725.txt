  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns a snapshot of the promise's state, which can be either "fulfilled" or "rejected". By checking for "rejected" instead of "fulfilled", the code would be checking for rejected promises instead of fulfilled ones, which could lead to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
