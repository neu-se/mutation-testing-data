  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual completion of the original promise, whereas `promise` is the promise object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a given value, whereas `promise` is the promise object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a method that rejects the promise with a given reason, whereas `promise` is the promise object itself.

DONE.
