  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with a single element, rather than a single element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with a different number of elements, depending on the value of `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new array with a different number of elements, depending on the value of `baseIndex`.

DONE.
