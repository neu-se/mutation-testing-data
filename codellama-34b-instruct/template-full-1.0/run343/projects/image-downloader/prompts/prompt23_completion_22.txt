  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join()` and `path.resolve()` treat the first argument differently. `path.join()` concatenates the first argument with the second argument, while `path.resolve()` treats the first argument as a relative path and resolves it against the current working directory. So, if the `dest` path is not absolute, using `path.join()` will result in a different path than using `path.resolve()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
___dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `__dirname` refers to the directory where the current module (i.e., the file containing the code) is located, whereas `__dirname` refers to the current working directory. So, if the `dest` path is not absolute, using `__dirname` will result in a different path than using `path.resolve()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.c
