Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to check if the destination's parent directory is the same as the destination itself, rather than its parent directory, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to check if the source's parent directory is the root directory, rather than the destination's parent directory, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(src).root
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to check if the source's root directory is the root directory, rather than the destination's parent directory, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
