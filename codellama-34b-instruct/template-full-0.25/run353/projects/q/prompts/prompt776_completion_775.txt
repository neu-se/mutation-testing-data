  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise. This would cause the `onFulfilled` callback to be called with the result of the original promise plus 1, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, but on the result of the original promise. This would cause the `onFulfilled` callback to be called with the result of the original promise plus 2, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(result) {
    return result + 3;
});
```
