  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` value is used instead of the `sinφ2` value, which would cause the calculation to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosφ1` value is used instead of the `sinφ2` value, which would cause the calculation to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanφ1` value is used instead of the `sinφ2` value, which would cause the calculation to return a different result.

DONE.
