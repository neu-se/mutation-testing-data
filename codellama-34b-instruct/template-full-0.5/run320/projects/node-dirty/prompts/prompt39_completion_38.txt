  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for value inequality only. This means that the new code fragment would consider `null` and `undefined` to be equal, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!` operator, which checks for truthiness. This means that the new code fragment would consider `null` and `undefined` to be falsy, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
