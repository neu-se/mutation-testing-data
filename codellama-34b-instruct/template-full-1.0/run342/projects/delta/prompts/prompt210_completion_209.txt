  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `ops` array, whereas `slice()` method creates a new array from a subset of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` method removed the first element of the `ops` array, whereas `slice()` method creates a new array from a subset of the original array without modifying the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` method creates a new array with elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `slice()` method creates a new array from a subset of the original array.

DONE.
