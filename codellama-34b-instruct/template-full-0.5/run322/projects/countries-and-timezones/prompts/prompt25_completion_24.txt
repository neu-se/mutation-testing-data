  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is already being passed to the `getOffsetStr` function, so calling it again would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` variable is not being passed to the `getOffsetStr` function, so the output would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(dstOffset - utcOffset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` and `utcOffset` variables are being subtracted, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
