  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(v) { return v; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `value` object, which is a promise, and the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback function. This would cause the promise to be resolved with a promise, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then(function(v) { return v; }, function(e) { throw e; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `value` object, which is a promise, and the `then` method returns a new promise that is resolved with the value returned by the callback function, or rejected with the reason returned by the errback function. This would cause the promise to be resolved with a promise, rather than the original value, and would also cause the promise to be rejected if the original value was rejected.
