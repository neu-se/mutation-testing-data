  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.set()` method would set the property with a value of `null` instead of the intended value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.set()` method would set the property with a value of `-1` instead of the intended value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.set()` method would set the property with a value of `void 0` (which is the same as `undefined`) instead of the intended value.

DONE.
