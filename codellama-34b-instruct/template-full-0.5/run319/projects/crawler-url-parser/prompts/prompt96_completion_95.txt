  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates the two operands and returns the last one. In this case, the `baseUrlStr` would be returned as the result of the expression. By replacing the comma with a plus sign, the code would attempt to concatenate the `href` and `baseUrlStr` strings, which would likely result in a different URL than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href - baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the comma operator, which evaluates the two operands and returns the last one. In this case, the `baseUrlStr` would be returned as the result of the expression. By replacing the comma with a minus sign, the code would attempt to subtract the `baseUrlStr` from the `href`, which would likely result in a different URL than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
