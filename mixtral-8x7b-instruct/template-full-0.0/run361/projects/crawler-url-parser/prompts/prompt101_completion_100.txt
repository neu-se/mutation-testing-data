 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.has` returns a boolean indicating whether the map contains the specified key, while `urlMap.get` returns the value associated with the key if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.keys().next().value` returns the first key in the map, while `urlMap.get` returns the value associated with the key if it exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.prototype.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.prototype.get` tries to access the `get` method of the `Map` prototype, which would throw an error because `Map` objects do not have a `get` property on their prototype.

DONE.
