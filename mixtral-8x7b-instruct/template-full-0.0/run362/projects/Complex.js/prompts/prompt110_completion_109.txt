 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the real part of the complex number, even if the original code would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the imaginary part of the complex number as the real part, even if the original code would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number as the real part, instead of the actual value calculated by the original code.

DONE.
