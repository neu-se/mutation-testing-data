  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || [null]
```
This change will cause the `nmapply` method to always pass a non-empty array to the `nodeArgs` variable, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || [undefined]
```
This change will cause the `nmapply` method to always pass a non-empty array to the `nodeArgs` variable, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args || [NaN]
```
This change will cause the `nmapply` method to always pass a non-empty array to the `nodeArgs` variable, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
