  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of whether the input promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be fulfilled immediately with the value `undefined`, regardless of whether the input promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the returned promise to be rejected immediately with the value "rejected", regardless of whether the input promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
