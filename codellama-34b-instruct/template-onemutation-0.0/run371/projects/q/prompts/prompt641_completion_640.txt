  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is used to retrieve a property value, whereas the `post` method is used to invoke a method. Using `get` instead of `post` would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise for the property value, rather than the return value of the method invocation.
