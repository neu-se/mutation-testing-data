  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = 5 + id
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable assignment from `field = prop` to `field = 5 + id`, which is a different value and could potentially break the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = !prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable assignment from `field = prop` to `field = !prop`, which is a different value and could potentially break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variable assignment from `field = prop` to `field = field + 1`, which is a different value and could potentially break the code.

DONE.
