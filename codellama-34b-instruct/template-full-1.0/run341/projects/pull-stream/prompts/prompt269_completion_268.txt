  Sure, here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `end` is `false`. As a result, `cb` would be called with `err` passed as an argument, which is likely to cause unexpected behavior and lead to failing test cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not considered equal to `true` or `false`, and would therefore cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `null`, which would cause an error. This would likely lead to failing test cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not considered equal to `true` or `null`, and would therefore cause the `if` statement to evaluate
