  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the key to be a unique string each time, which would not match the original key and would result in a new entry being added to the database instead of updating the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the key to be uppercased, which would not match the original key and would result in a new entry being added to the database instead of updating the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the key to be a new string that is one character longer than the original key, which would not match the original key and would result in a new entry being added to the database instead of updating the existing one.

DONE.
