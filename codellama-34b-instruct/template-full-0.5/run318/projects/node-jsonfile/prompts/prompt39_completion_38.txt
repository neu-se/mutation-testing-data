  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.writeFile`, which means that it will block the execution of the program until the file is written, whereas `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous version that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(fs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(fs)` is a bound version of `fs.writeFile`, which means that it will always use the `fs` object as the `this` value when calling the function. This can be useful if you want to ensure that the function is always called with a specific `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile.bind(null)` is a bound version of `fs.write
