 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject.bind(deferred)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls the `reject` method with `deferred` as the context, which might not have the same effect as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { deferred.reject() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `deferred.reject` call in an anonymous function, which could affect how errors are handled and propagated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the rejection with a resolution, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

DONE.
