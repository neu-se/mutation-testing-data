 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new Delta().chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new, empty Delta object and calls the `chop` method on it, instead of using the `retDelta` variable that contains the result of the diff operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.chop()
