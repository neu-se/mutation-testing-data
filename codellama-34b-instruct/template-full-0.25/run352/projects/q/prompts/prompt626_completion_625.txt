  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is not bound and may refer to a different function depending on the context in which it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` may be called later or not at all, depending on the context in which it is used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method immediately with the specified arguments, whereas `this.dispatch` may be called later with different arguments or not at all, depending on the context in which it is used.
