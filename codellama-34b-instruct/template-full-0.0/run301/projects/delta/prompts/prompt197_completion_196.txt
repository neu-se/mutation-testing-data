  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed, even if the `retain` property was previously set to a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `0`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to be executed, even if the `retain` property was previously set to a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `NaN`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false
