 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.reject` function would always return early, and the `resolvedPromise` would never be updated, even if a reason is provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.reject` function would always return early, and the `resolvedPromise` would be set to `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could cause issues in the rest of the code that expects a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.reject` function would always return early, and the `resolvedPromise` would be set to a new (unrelated) promise object instead of a rejected promise, which could cause issues in the rest of the code that expects a rejected promise.

DONE.
