  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `item` would push the item onto the array, while `null` would push `null` onto the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `item` would push the item onto the array, while `undefined` would push `undefined` onto the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `item` would push the item onto the array, while `0` would push the number 0 onto the array.

DONE.
