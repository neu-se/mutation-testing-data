  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a` and `b` instead of multiplying them, which could cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the values of `a` and `b` instead of adding them, which could cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the value of `b` from `a` instead of adding them, which could cause the calculation of the distance between two points to be incorrect.

DONE.
