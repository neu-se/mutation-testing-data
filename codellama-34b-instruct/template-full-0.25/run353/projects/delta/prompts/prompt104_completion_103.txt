  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `predicate` function, causing the `filter` method to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `predicate` function, causing the `filter` method to return a different set of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the result of the `predicate` function, causing the `filter` method to return a different set of elements.

DONE.
