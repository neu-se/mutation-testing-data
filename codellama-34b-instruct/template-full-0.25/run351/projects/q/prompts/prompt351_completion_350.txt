Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `makeStackTraceLong` function, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `makeStackTraceLong` function, which would cause the function to behave differently.
