 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, and the `reduce` function would not process any elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index == length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or processing an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index++ < length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment the `index` variable before checking the condition, potentially causing an off-by-one error and skipping or processing the wrong elements.

DONE.
