  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.replace('key', 'value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would modify the `rowStr` value, potentially causing the `JSON.parse` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would modify the `rowStr` value, potentially causing the `JSON.parse` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of characters, rather than a string, potentially causing the `JSON.parse` method to fail.

DONE.
