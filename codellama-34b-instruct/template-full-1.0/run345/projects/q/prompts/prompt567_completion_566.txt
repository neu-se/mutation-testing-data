  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is not assigned to the output of the `spread` function, which is the original intention of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable would now be assigned to `false`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if the promise has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable would now be assigned to `null`, which is a primitive value and will not have the same behavior as the `Promise` object that was expected.

DONE.
