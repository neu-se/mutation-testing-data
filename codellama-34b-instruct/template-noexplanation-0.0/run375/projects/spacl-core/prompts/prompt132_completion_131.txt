  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "GET";
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `true` for the "GET" verb, regardless of the actual verb used in the request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "POST";
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `true` for the "POST" verb, regardless of the actual verb used in the request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = "PUT";
```
This change will cause the `query` method to always return `true` for the "PUT" verb, regardless of the actual verb used in the request.

DONE.
