  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(10, places) || 0`, which would always return `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(10, places) && 0`, which would always return `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places + 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(10, places) + 0`, which would always return `10`.

DONE.
