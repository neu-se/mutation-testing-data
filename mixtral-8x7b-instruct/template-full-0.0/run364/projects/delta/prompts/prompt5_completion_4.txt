 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would keep keys with undefined values instead of removing them, which is the original purpose of the `keepNull` flag.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delete attributes[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove keys with null values, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
keepNull = !keepNull;
```
This would result in different behavior because it toggles the value of the `keepNull` flag, causing the function to either keep or remove keys with null values based on the original value of `keepNull`.

DONE.
