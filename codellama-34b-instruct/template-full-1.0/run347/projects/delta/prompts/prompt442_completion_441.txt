  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be incremented by 1, which could change the result of the `substr` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the substring would be the length of the entire string, rather than the length of the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Math.min(offset + length, this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function would return the minimum of `offset + length` and `this.offset`, which could result in a different substring being returned.

DONE.
