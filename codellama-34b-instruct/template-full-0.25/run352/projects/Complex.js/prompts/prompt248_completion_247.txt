  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a) * Math.cos(b) + Math.cosm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a)` would be evaluated as `NaN` when `a` is `NaN`, whereas `Math.cosm1(b)` would be evaluated as `NaN` when `b` is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a) * Math.cos(b) + Math.cosm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a)` would be evaluated as `NaN` when `a` is `NaN`, whereas `Math.cosm1(a)` would be evaluated as `NaN` when `a` is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(b) * Math.cos(a) + Math.cosm1(b)
