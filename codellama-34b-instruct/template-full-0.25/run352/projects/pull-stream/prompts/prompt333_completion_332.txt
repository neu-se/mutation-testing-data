  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only calls `cb` with the `end` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, but with the `data` argument incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, but with the `data` argument decremented by 1.

DONE.
