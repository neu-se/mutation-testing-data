  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Array(verbs).flat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `verbs` variable directly, whereas this replacement uses the `flat()` method to create a new array before iterating over it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code iterates over all elements of the `verbs` array, whereas this replacement only iterates over the first `n-1` elements, where `n` is the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code iterates over all elements of the `verbs` array, whereas this replacement only iterates over the elements that pass the filter function, which is `Boolean` in this case.
