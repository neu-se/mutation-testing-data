  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the word would not be converted to plural correctly.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the word would not be converted to plural correctly.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[i]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the word would not be converted to plural correctly when it ends with a vowel followed by the letter 'i'.

DONE.
