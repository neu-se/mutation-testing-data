  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function noop() {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would now throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function noop() {
    return "Hello, world!";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would now return a string value instead of `undefined`, which would affect the behavior of the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function noop() {
    return Q.reject("Something went wrong");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would now return a rejected promise, which would cause the `when` function to also return a rejected promise.

DONE.
