  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value without any de-duplication check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the value to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(row.val)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value as a clone of the original value.

DONE.
