 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the buffer would be completely emptied, discarding the last row of data that was read from the file. This could lead to data loss and inconsistencies between the in-memory cache and the on-disk data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arr.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the first row of data that was read from the file would be discarded instead of the last one. This could lead to data loss and inconsistencies between the in-memory cache and the on-disk data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
buffer = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the buffer would be cleared before processing the rows of data that were read from the file. This could lead to data loss and inconsistencies between the in-memory cache and the on-disk data.

DONE.
