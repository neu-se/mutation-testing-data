```
this._writeStream.end = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the actual ending of the write stream is prevented, causing the data to remain in the queue and never be written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write;
```
This would result in different behavior because the write method is not called, preventing the data from being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because a function is passed as a parameter, but it does nothing, so the data is never actually written to the file.

DONE.
