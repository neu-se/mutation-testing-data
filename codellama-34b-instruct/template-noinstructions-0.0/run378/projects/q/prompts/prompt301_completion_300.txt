  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the array would be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain two references to the same object, rather than two different objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would contain two null references, rather than two objects.

DONE.
