  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is the opposite of `ses.ok`, so it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.maybeOk` is a new property that doesn't exist in the `ses` object, so it would evaluate to `undefined`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok && ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, even if `ses.ok` is `true`.

DONE.
