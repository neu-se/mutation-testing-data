  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `progressed` argument to the `progress` method, while the new code fragment passes an empty function. The `progress` method would still be called, but it would not receive any arguments, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `progressed` argument to the `progress` method, while the new code fragment passes `null`. The `progress` method would still be called, but it would receive `null` as an argument, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `progressed` argument to the `progress` method, while the new code fragment passes `undefined`. The `progress` method would still be called, but it would receive `undefined` as an argument, which could
