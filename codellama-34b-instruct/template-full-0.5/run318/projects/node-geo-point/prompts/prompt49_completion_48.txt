  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the first point instead of the second point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference in longitude between the two points instead of using the latitude of the second point.

DONE.
