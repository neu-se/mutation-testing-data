 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNaN(this.re + this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is NaN, instead of checking if either part is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.isNaN(this.re) || Number.isNaN(this.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Number.isNaN` method, which checks if the value is NaN and is not affected by the non-standard behavior of the `isNaN` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.re !== this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is not equal to itself, which would always return false, and not check if the complex number is NaN.

DONE.
