  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the operation, potentially causing the code to access an invalid index in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the operation, potentially causing the code to skip over a valid index in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the operation, potentially causing the code to access an invalid index in the array or to skip over a valid index.

DONE.
