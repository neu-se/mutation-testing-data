  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    throw err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment would throw an error regardless of the value of `pendingCount`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment would return an error regardless of the value of `pendingCount`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return Q.reject(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `pendingCount` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise regardless of the value of `pendingCount`.
