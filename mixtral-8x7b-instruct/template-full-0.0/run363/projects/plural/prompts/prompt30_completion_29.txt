 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thes|cris/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` in "thesis" would not be matched, and the `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, so "crisis" would not match either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|quiz/i
```
This would result in different behavior because "quiz" is not a word that should be changed to its plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|crisis|xenon/i
```
This would result in different behavior because "xenon" is an element that does not have a plural form.

DONE.
