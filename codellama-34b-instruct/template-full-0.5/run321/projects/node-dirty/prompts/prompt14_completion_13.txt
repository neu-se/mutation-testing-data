  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is used instead of `cbs.push(cb)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is used instead of `push`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, 0, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is used instead of `push`.

DONE.
