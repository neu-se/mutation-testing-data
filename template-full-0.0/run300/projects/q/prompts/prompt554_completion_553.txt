  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `callback` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("test")` will throw an error, whereas `callback` will return a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `callback` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
