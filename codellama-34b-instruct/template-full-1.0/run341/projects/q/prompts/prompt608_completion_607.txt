  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `args` to be an array, but by replacing it with `null`, the function will throw a `TypeError` when trying to read the `length` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `args` to be an array, but by replacing it with `undefined`, the function will throw a `TypeError` when trying to read the `length` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `args` to be an array, but by replacing it with an object (`{}`), the function will throw a `TypeError` when trying to read the `length` property of an object.

DONE.
