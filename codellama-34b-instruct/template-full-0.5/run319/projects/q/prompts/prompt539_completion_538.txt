  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to exit early, without fulfilling the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Rejected");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the promise to be rejected, rather than fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a specific error message, rather than being fulfilled with the value.

DONE.
