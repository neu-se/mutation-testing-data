  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `replacer` and `spaces` arguments to customize the stringification process, while the new code does not. This could lead to differences in the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, spaces) + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `replacer` argument to customize the stringification process, while the new code does not. This could lead to differences in the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, spaces) + '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `EOL` variable to determine the end-of-line character, while the new code uses a hard-coded newline character. This could lead to differences in the resulting string.
