  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain !== pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this replacement checks if they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this replacement checks if the domain of the link URL is equal to the subdomain of the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length > pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this replacement checks if the length of the domain of the link URL is greater than the length of the domain of the page URL.

DONE.
