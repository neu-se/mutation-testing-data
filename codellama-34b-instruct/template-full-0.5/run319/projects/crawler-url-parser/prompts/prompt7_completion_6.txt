  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the `baseUrlStr` to be considered valid even if it contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `false` condition would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be considered invalid even if it does not contain illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && baseUrlStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `baseUrlStr.length > 0` condition would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be considered invalid if it is empty,
