  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(aeiouy)o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a negated character class to match any character except `aeiouy`, while this code fragment uses a character class to match any of `aeiouy`. This change would cause the rule to match words that end with `o` followed by any of `aeiouy`, while the original rule matches words that end with `o` not followed by any of `aeiouy`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a negated character class to match any character except `aeiouy`, while this code fragment uses a character class to match any of `aeiouy`. This change would cause the rule to match words that end with `
