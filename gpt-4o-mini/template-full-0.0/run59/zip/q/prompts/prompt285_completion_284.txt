Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `value` with `null` would cause the promise to resolve with `null` instead of the intended value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in any subsequent promise chains that rely on the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `value` would mean that the promise resolves with `undefined`, which is different from resolving with a specific value, and could lead to errors or incorrect logic in the handling of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because resolving the promise with the string `"error"` instead of the actual `value` would mislead any consumers of the promise into thinking that an error occurred, even when the operation was successful, thus breaking the expected flow of the promise handling.

DONE.
