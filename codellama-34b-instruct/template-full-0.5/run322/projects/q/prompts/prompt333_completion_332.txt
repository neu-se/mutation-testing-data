  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `result`, while this new code fragment returns the value of `result` plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `result`, while this new code fragment returns the value of `result` multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `result`, while this new code fragment returns the value of `result` minus 1.

DONE.
