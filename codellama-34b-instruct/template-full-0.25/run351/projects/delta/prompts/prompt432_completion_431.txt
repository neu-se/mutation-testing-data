  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `ops` array instead of the current element, which could lead to unexpected results in the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `ops` array instead of the current element, which could lead to unexpected results in the `next` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the element after the next element in the `ops` array instead of the current element, which could lead to unexpected results in the `next` method.

DONE.
