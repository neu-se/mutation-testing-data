 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object when `thisIter.next()` is falsy, instead of throwing an error or returning `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing infinite loops or incorrect results in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next.bind(thisIter)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately invoke the `next` method, potentially causing issues if the method relies on the current state of the iterator.

DONE.
