  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, rather than resolved with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Intentional rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the original code.

DONE.
