  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```ruby
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because !resolvedPromise is condition code that is inverted value of resolvedPromise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```html
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because "progress" is a not a conditional expression but a variable representing progress of promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!progress
```
This would result in different behavior because !progress is condition code that is inverted value of progress variable representing progress of promise.

DONE.
