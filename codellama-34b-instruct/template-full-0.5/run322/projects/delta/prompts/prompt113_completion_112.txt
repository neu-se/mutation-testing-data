  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum up the elements of the array instead of concatenating them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would sum up the elements of the array starting from 0 instead of concatenating them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((a, b) => a + b, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the elements of the array starting from an empty string instead of summing them up.

DONE.
