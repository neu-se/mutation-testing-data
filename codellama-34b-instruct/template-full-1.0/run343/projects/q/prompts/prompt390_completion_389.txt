  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called in this case, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var foo = "bar";
```
This would result in different behavior because `foo` is not defined in the code, and referencing it would cause a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called with the correct argument in this case, which could lead to unexpected behavior or bugs.

DONE.
