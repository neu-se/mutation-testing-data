  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that takes a callback as its argument, while `process.nextTick.bind(null)` is a bound function that has already been called with `null` as its `this` value, and it will return a new function that will call the original `process.nextTick` function with `null` as its `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick.bind(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that takes a callback as its argument, while `process.nextTick.bind(process)` is a bound function that has already been called with `process` as its `this` value, and it will return a new function that will call the original `process.nextTick` function with `process` as its `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACE
