 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `retain` would become `null` instead of the `attributes` object, which could cause issues if the code downstream relies on the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `retain` would become an empty object, which might not cause immediate issues, but could lead to unexpected behavior if the code downstream relies on specific attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>thisOp.attributes, <any>otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it casts both `thisOp.attributes` and `otherOp.attributes` to `any`, potentially allowing for type-related issues if the code downstream relies on specific attribute types.

DONE.
