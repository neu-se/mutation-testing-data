  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  throw new Error('getHandler is not implemented');
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a handler function, while this modified code would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  return () => {
    throw new Error('Handler is not implemented');
  };
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a handler function, while this modified code would return a function that throws an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = () => {
  return null;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have returned a handler function, while this modified code would return null instead.

DONE.
