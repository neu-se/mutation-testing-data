  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not match the same strings as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of strings than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/, '+')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of strings than the original code fragment.

DONE.
