  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `const cb`, which declared a constant `cb` without initializing it. The new code fragment initializes `cb` to an empty function, which would cause the `for...of` loop to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `const cb`, which declared a constant `cb` without initializing it. The new code fragment initializes `cb` to `undefined`, which would cause the `for...of` loop to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `const cb`, which declared a constant `cb` without initializing it. The new code fragment initializes `cb` to `null`, which would cause the `for...of` loop to execute differently.
