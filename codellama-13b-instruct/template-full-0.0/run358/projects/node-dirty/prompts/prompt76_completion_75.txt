  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` method would return `1` instead of `0`, indicating that the database was loaded successfully.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` method would return `-1` instead of `0`, indicating that the database was not loaded successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` method would return `undefined` instead of `0`, indicating that the database was not loaded successfully.

DONE.
