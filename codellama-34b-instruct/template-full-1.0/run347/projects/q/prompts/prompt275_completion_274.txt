  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` will reject the promise with the provided reason, while `self.resolve` will resolve the promise with the provided reason, leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` will reject the promise with the provided reason, while `self.fulfill` will fulfill the promise with the provided reason, leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.reject` will reject the promise with the provided reason, while `self.notReject` will not reject the promise, leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
