  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the first element of the array is accessed, but in this modified code, the second element is accessed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the first element of the array is accessed, but in this modified code, the last element of the array is accessed instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length / 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array being accessed is different. In the original code, the first element of the array is accessed, but in this modified code, the middle element of the array is accessed instead.

DONE.
