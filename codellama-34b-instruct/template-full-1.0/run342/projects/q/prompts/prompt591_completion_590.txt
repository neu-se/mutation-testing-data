  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because the promises in the array would be resolved in any order instead of all at once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because the promises in the array would be resolved in any order until one of them is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because the promises in the array would be resolved in any order until none of them are resolved.

DONE.
