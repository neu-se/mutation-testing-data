  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index)
```
This change will cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(start - index)
```
This change will cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - start)
```
This change will cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, which may cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
