  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would not be called, and the progress of the promise would not be updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with an empty function as an argument, which could cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

DONE.
