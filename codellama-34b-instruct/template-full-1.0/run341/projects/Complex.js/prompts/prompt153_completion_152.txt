  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `z` being infinite is missing in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']()}
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `z` not being infinite is missing in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']() || z['isNaN']()`
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `z` being finite or `NaN`, while the original code fragment only checks for `z` being infinite.

DONE.
