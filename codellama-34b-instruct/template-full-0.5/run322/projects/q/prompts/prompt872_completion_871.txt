  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).done(fulfilled, rejected, progress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is not a member of the `Q` object, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).timeout(ms, error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method is not a member of the `Q` object, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(object).delay(timeout);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method is not a member of the `Q` object, and it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
