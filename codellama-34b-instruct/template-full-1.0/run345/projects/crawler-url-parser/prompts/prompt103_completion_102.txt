  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text) || text.includes(tmpUrl.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text is present in the URL's text property or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text !== tmpUrl.text
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text does not match the URL's text property exactly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!text.localeCompare(tmpUrl.text)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the text does not match the URL's text property and ignore case.

DONE.
