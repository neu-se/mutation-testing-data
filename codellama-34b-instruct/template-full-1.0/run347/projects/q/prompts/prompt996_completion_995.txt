  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when `nodeArgs.push()` is called with `undefined`, it would add `undefined` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because when `nodeArgs.push()` is called with a function, it would add the function to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because when `nodeArgs.push()` is called with a string, it would add the string to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, which is not the desired behavior.

DONE.
