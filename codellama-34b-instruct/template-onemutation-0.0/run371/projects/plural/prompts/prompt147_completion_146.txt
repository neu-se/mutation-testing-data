  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a string. In the original code, `rule[1]` is used as a replacement string for the regular expression, but `rule[0]` would be used as a replacement string, which would result in a different output.

DONE.
