  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is a keyword in JavaScript that indicates the absence of a return value. In the original code, `arguments` is an object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function, but `void` is not a valid value for this object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object value. In the original code, `arguments` is an object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function, but `null` is not a valid value for this object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any value. In the original code, `arguments` is an object that contains the values of the arguments passed to the function, but `undefined` is not a valid value for this
