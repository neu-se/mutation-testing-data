  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `a` is equal to 0 and `b` is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `a` is greater than 0 and `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value when `a` is greater than 0 or `b` is equal to 0.

DONE.
