  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. In this case, the function is expected to return a rejected promise if the `options.url` is not provided, but if `Promise.resolve` is used instead, the function will return a resolved promise, which may not be the intended behavior.
