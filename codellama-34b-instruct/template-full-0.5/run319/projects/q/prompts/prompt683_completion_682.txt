  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a reference to an object as its first argument, and passing `null` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a reference to an object as its first argument, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects a reference to an object as its first argument, and passing a string would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
