  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max()` returns the maximum of its arguments, while `Op.length` is a getter method for the length of an op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved promise, while `Op.length` is a getter method for the length of an op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify()` converts its argument to a JSON string, while `Op.length` is a getter method for the length of an op.

DONE.
