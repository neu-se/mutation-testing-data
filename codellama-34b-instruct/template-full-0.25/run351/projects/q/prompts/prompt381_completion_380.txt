  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the same value as the original promise, but it would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { throw new Error("error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected with a new error, regardless of the resolution of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return Q.reject(value); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is rejected with the same value as the original promise, but it would not propagate the rejection of the original promise.

DONE.
