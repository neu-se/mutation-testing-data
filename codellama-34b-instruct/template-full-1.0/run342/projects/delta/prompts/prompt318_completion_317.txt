  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number, while the replacement code checks if it's a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is null, while the replacement code checks if it's any non-null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is a number or null, while the replacement code checks if it's any object.

DONE.
