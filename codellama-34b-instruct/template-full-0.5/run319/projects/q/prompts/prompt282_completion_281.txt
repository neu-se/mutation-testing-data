  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the length of the array to be greater than 1, but this replacement code fragment would always result in a length of 0, causing the `if` statement to always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the length of the array to be greater than 1, but this replacement code fragment would always result in a length of 2, causing the `if` statement to always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the length of the array to be greater than 1, but this replacement code fragment would always result in a length of 0, causing the `if` statement to always be false.

DONE.
