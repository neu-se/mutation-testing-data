  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```clearInterval```. This would result in different behavior because this would clear the interval thats running instead of the timeout that has occured.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```clearTimeout;```. This would result in different behavior because this would clear the timeouts thats running in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```throw "Some Error";```. This would result in different behavior because this will throw an error instead of clearing the timeout.

DONE.
