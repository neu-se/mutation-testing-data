  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress + 1 }
```
This change will cause the progress notification to be one greater than the actual progress, which may cause confusion or unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress - 1 }
```
This change will cause the progress notification to be one less than the actual progress, which may cause confusion or unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index, value: progress * 2 }
```
This change will cause the progress notification to be twice the actual progress, which may cause confusion or unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
