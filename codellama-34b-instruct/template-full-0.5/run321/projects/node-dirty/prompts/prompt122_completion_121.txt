  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drained'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now incorrect, causing the event listener to never be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain' + 'ed'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now a concatenation of two strings, causing the event listener to never be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain' + 'ing'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is now a concatenation of two strings, causing the event listener to never be triggered.

DONE.
