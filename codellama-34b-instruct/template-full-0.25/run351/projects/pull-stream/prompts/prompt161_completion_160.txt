  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `_value` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `value` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `null` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment `cb`.

DONE.
