  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is a promise that resolves to a value, but in this replacement, the `object.value()` expression returns the value directly, potentially causing issues with the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is a promise that resolves to a value, but in this replacement, the `object + 1` expression always produces a value, even if the promise is rejected, potentially causing issues with the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is a promise that resolves to a value, but in this replacement, the `null` expression always produces a value of `null`, potentially causing issues with the promise chain.

DONE.
