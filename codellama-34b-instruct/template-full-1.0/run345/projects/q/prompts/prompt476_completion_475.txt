  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `splice()` changes the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove items from a different array than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value to `splice()`, potentially causing an error or incorrect behavior.

DONE.
