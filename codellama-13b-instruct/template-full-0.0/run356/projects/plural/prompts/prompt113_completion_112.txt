  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "clothes", while the modified code fragment returns the length of the array "clothes".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "clothes", while the modified code fragment returns the first element of the array "clothes".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.join('-')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the string "clothes", while the modified code fragment returns a string that is the result of joining the elements of the array "clothes" with the hyphen character.

DONE.
