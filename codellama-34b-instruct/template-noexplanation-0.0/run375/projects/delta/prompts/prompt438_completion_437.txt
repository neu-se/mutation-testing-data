  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `retain` property of the `nextOp` object to be evaluated as a string, which may produce different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This change will cause the `retain` property of the `nextOp` object to be evaluated as an object, which may produce different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This change will cause the `retain` property of the `nextOp` object to be evaluated as a function, which may produce different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
