  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` returns a timezone object, while `getCountry` returns a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects, while `getCountry` returns a single country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountryForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountryForTimezone` returns a single country object, while `getCountry` returns a country object that may not be the same as the one returned by `getCountryForTimezone`.

DONE.
