  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten if it already exists, whereas the original code used the default `flags` option, which is `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to if it already exists.

DONE.
