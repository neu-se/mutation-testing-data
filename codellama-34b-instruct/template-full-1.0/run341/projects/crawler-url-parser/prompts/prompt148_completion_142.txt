  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `/` is replaced with an empty string, which would cause the `split()` method to return an array with a single empty string element, instead of an array with multiple substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would throw a `TypeError` when called with `null` as the first argument, as `null` is not a valid string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would throw a `TypeError` when called with `undefined` as the first argument, as `undefined` is not a valid string.

DONE.
