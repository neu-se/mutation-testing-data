  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and the comparison with `'insert'` would always evaluate to `false` for a `Delta` object.

DONE.
