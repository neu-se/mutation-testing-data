  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the data to the error output instead of the standard output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would convert the data to uppercase before logging it, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.split(' ').join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because `split(' ').join('')` would remove all spaces from the data before logging it, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
