  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is not called, which could cause issues if the function is expected to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is called with `undefined` as an argument, which could cause issues if the function expects a different type of argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function is called with `0` as an argument, which could cause issues if the function expects a different type of argument or a different value.

DONE.
