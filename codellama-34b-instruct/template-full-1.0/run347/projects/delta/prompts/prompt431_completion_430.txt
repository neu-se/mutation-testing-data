  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `length` is falsy, while this code checks if `length` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `length` is falsy, while this code checks if `length` is greater than 0 and negates the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `length` is falsy, while this code checks if `length` is greater than or equal to Infinity.

DONE.
