  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, while the replacement code fragment calculates the opposite side.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, while the replacement code fragment calculates the adjacent side.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, while the replacement code fragment calculates the sum of the two sides.

DONE.
