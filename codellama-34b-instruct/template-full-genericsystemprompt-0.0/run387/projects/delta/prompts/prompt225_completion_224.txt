  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the strings is reversed, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor argument is null, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the cursor argument is 0, which would cause the diff algorithm to produce a different output.

DONE.
