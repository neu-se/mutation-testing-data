  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.random()` function would introduce a random factor into the calculation, which would likely cause the final result to be different from the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the final result to be one greater than the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the final result to be one less than the expected value.

DONE.
