  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `else` block to always be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with the `src` variable as an argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply checks if `src` is a glob pattern without calling any function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.startsWith('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method checks if the `src` string starts with the `*` character, which is not what the original code does. The original code checks if `src` is a glob pattern using the `isGlob` function.

DONE.
