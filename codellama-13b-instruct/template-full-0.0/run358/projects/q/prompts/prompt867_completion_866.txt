  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function () {
    deferred.resolve(value);
}, timeout);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `setTimeout` with a delay of `timeout` milliseconds, while the modified code uses `setTimeout` with a delay of `0` milliseconds, causing the promise to be resolved immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function () {
    deferred.reject(new Error("Timeout error"));
}, timeout);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `setTimeout` with a delay of `timeout` milliseconds, while the modified code uses `setTimeout` with a delay of `0` milliseconds, causing the promise to be rejected immediately with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function () {
    deferred.resolve(value);
}, timeout + 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because
