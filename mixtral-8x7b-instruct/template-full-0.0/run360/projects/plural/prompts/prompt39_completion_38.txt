 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` does not accept negative values for the second argument, while `substr` does. This change would cause an error when the input word has a length less than 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ice' }
