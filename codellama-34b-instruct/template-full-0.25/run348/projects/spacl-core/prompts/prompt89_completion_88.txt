  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to use the same key for all policies, which would lead to unexpected behavior when querying the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to use `null` as the value for all policies, which would lead to unexpected behavior when querying the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to use the uppercase version of the policy name as the key, which would lead to unexpected behavior when querying the map.

DONE.
