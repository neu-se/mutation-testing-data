  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, while the new code fragment `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise object. The promise object has a different behavior than the deferred object, and it may cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
