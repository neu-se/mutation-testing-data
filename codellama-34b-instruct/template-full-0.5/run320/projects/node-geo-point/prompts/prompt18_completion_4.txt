  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') || !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the object is checked to have both properties, while in this new code, it checks if either property is missing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the object is checked to have both properties, while in this new code, it checks if either property is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && !object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the object is checked to have both properties, while in this new code, it checks if neither property is present.

DONE.
