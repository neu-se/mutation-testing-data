 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` without any arguments in case of a successful read, while this modification always passes the data to the callback, even if the read was not successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
