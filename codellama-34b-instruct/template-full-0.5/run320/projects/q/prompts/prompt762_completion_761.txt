  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a promise that is already resolved, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a promise that is already rejected, while the original code fragment returns a promise that is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred object, which is not a promise.

DONE.
