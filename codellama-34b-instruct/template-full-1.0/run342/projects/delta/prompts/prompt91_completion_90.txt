  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because !newOp.attributes would negate the attributes object, causing the if statement to always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because newOp.attributes != null would check if the attributes object is not null, which is always true, causing the if statement to always succeed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === { test: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because newOp.attributes === { test: true } would check if the attributes object is equal to { test: true }, which is always false, causing the if statement to always fail.

DONE.
