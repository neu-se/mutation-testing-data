  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that would be called immediately, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that would be resolved later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that would be called immediately, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that would be resolved later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that would be called immediately, whereas `defer` is a function that returns a promise that would be resolved later.

DONE.
