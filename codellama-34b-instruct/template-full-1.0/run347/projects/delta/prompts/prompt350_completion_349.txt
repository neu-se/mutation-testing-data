  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object and `op.attributes.retain` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object and `op.attributes[i]` would reference a property of the object, which could have a different value than the original property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is an object and `op.attributes - 1` would result in `NaN`, which is a different value than the original property.

DONE.
