  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is `null`, the `cb` function will not be called, and the `sink` function will not be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is `undefined`, the `cb` function will not be called, and the `sink` function will not be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is `false`, the `cb` function will not be called, and the `sink` function will not be returned.

DONE.
