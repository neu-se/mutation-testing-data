  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This change will cause the `Math.sin` function to use the `arg` property instead of the `phi` property, which may result in different behavior for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + Math.PI
```
This change will cause the `Math.sin` function to use the `arg` property plus pi, which may result in different behavior for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `Math.sin` function to use the `arg` property multiplied by 2, which may result in different behavior for certain input values.

DONE.
