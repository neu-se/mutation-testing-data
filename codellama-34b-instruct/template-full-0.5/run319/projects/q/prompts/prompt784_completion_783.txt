  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would be passed as the first argument to `then` instead of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value in JavaScript, and it would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the promise's error handler.

DONE.
