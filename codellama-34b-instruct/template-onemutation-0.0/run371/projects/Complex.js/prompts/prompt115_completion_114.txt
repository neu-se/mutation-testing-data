  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a complex number, while `a + 1` is a real number. The `add` method is defined for complex numbers, but not for real numbers, so the code would produce a different result.

DONE.
