  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cancel'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Dirty class to emit the 'cancel' event instead of the 'drain' event, which could potentially break existing code that relies on the 'drain' event being emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'done'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Dirty class to emit the 'done' event instead of the 'drain' event, which could potentially break existing code that relies on the 'drain' event being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Dirty class to emit the 'error' event instead of the 'drain' event, which could potentially break existing code that relies on the 'drain' event being emitted.

DONE.
