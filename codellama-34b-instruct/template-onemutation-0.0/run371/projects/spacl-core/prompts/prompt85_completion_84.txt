  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with `null` as the name and `false` as the deep flag, which would create a new policy with a null name and shallow copy of the rules, rather than a new policy with the same name and a deep copy of the rules as in the original code fragment.
