  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a property of the `Op` object, while `attributes` is a property of the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is an `Op` object, while `baseOp` is a `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a property of the `Op` object, while `attributes` is a property of the `Delta` object.

DONE.
