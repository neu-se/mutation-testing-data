 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Buggy!')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new Error object is created instead of using the original exception, which might cause the error handling code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is returned instead of propagating the exception, which might cause the error handling code to not execute or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the exception is resolved instead of rejected, which might cause the error handling code to not execute or behave differently.

DONE.
