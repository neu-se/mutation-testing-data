  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would return the reason for the rejection, while the new code fragment `null` would return `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would return the reason for the rejection, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would return the reason for the rejection, while the new code fragment `"Error"` would return the string `"Error"` instead.

DONE.
