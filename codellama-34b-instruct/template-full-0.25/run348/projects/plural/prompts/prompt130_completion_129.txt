  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, starting from the last rule in the array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < rules.length * 2; i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice as fast, skipping every other rule in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i -= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, starting from the last rule in the array, and would skip every other rule in the array.

DONE.
