  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array.length` is a number, and the `map` function would not be able to iterate over a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array[0]` is the first element of the array, and the `map` function would not be able to iterate over a single element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array.slice(1)` is a new array that contains all elements of the original array except the first one, and the `map` function would not be able to iterate over a new array.

DONE.
