  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which would result in the plural form of the word being `'people'`. However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `'people'`, the plural form of the word would still be `'people'`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persons'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which would result in the plural form of the word being `'people'`. However, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `'persons'`, the plural form of the word would be `'persons'`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'persona'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'person'`, which would result in the plural form of the word being `'people'`.
