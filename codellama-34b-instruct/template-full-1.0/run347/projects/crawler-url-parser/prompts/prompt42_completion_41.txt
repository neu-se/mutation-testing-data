  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is expected to be a string, but `null` is not a string and will cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if it is passed to the `URL.parse()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid URL and will cause the code to throw a `URIError` if it is passed to the `URL.parse()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function will parse the `"http://"` string as a URL and return an object with properties corresponding to the different components of the URL, such as the protocol, host, path, etc. However, the `baseUrlStr` variable is expected to be a URL that can be resolved relative to the current page URL, so passing a hardcoded
