Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for a 'delete' operation instead of an 'insert' operation, which would alter the logic of how operations are processed in the composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the comparison operator from `<=` to `>=`, potentially allowing more operations to be processed than intended, which could lead to incorrect composition results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check for equality instead of a less than or equal condition, which would restrict the number of operations that can be processed, possibly leading to incomplete composition.

DONE.
