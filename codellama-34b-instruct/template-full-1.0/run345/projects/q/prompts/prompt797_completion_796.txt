  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would not be called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with a `noop` function, which would not do anything with the progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would be called with `null` as the progress notification, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

DONE.
