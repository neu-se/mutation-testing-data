  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with 4 arguments, instead of the original 3 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with 5 arguments, instead of the original 3 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with 6 arguments, instead of the original 3 arguments.

DONE.
