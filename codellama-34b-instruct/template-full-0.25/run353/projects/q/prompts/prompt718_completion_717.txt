  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while this new code fragment returns an array with a single element, the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while this new code fragment returns an array with a single element, the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an empty array, while this new code fragment returns an array with a single element, the value `null`.

DONE.
