 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition checks if the index is less than or equal to the end index, but the replacement would cause the index to always be greater than the end index after the first iteration, causing the loop to terminate early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index - length
