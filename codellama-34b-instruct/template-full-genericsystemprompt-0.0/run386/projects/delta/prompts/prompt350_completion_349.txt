  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `invert()` is not a valid method for the `attributes` property of an `Op` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is not a valid property of the `attributes` property of an `Op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` is not a valid method for the `attributes` property of an `Op` object.

DONE.
