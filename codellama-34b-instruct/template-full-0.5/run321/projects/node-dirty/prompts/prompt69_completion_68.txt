  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, instead of the actual number of loaded keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `-1`, which would indicate that an error occurred while loading the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', NaN);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `NaN`, which would indicate that the database is in an invalid state.

DONE.
