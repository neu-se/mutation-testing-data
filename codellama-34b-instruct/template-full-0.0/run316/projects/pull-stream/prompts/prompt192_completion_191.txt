  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the program to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a different argument, causing the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` function would be called with a different argument, causing the program to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
