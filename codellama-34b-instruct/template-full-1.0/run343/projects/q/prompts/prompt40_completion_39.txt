  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is used to schedule a function to be called repeatedly, whereas `setTimeout` is used to schedule a function to be called once after a delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout(0)` is used to schedule a function to be called immediately, whereas `setTimeout(0)` is used to schedule a function to be called after a delay of 0 milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is used to schedule a function to be called before the next repaint of the screen, whereas `setTimeout` is used to schedule a function to be called after a delay.

DONE.
