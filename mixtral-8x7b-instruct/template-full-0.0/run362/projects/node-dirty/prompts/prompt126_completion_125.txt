 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'write\_close' event is not emitted anymore, which could lead to unexpected behavior if other parts of the code rely on this event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'writable_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'writable\_close' event is not the same as 'write\_close', and if other parts of the code rely on the 'write\_close' event, they will not receive it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
