  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reducer` function with the `acc` and `data` arguments, which is not the intended behavior of the original code. The original code fragment was simply returning the `reducer` function, without calling it.

DONE.
