Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"An error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with the original exception, it would reject with a generic string message, losing the context of the actual error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a new error object containing a fixed message, rather than propagating the original exception that caused the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting with `undefined` would not provide any meaningful error information, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections without any context about what went wrong.

DONE.
