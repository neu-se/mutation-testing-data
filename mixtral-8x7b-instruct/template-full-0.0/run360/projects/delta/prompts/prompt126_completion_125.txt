 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking if the index is greater than the start, which would reverse the order of the elements in the slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= start
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking if the index is greater than or equal to the start, which would include the start index in the slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 < start
