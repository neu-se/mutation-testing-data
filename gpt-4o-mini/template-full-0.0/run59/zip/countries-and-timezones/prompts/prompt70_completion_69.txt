Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizedTimezones += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increments the `memoizedTimezones` counter without actually memoizing the timezone, leading to potential incorrect caching behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[name] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the timezone to `null` instead of memoizing the actual timezone object, causing subsequent calls to return `null` for that timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone({ name, countries: [] });
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new timezone object with an empty `countries` array, which may not represent the actual timezone data, leading to incorrect results when retrieving countries for that timezone.

DONE.
