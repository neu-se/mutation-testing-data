  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== false` would always evaluate to `true` if `res` is not `null`, even if `res` is not explicitly allowed or denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === null` would evaluate to `true` if `res` is `null`, which would bypass the explicit allow or deny check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== true` would evaluate to `true` if `res` is `null`, or if `res` is explicitly denied.

DONE.
