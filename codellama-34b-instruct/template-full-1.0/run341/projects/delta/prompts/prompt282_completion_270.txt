  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation, rather than just the length of the retain operation, which could result in redundant or incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the other operation, rather than just the length of the retain operation, which could result in redundant or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation, rather than just the length of the retain operation, which could result in redundant or incorrect behavior.

DONE.
