  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `tzName` variable, which is a string representing the name of a timezone, while the new code fragment uses the string literal `"UTC"`, which is a specific timezone. The `getTimezone` function will return a different result for these two inputs, leading to different behavior in the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

DONE.
