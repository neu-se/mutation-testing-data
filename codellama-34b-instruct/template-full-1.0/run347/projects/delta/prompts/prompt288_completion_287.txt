  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(Op.length(iter.peek()))
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete()` would delete the current line, rather than pushing the current operation to the `line` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(Op.length(iter.peek()))
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain()` would retain the current line, rather than pushing the current operation to the `line` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.peek())
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.push()` would push the current operation to the `line` delta, rather than deleting or retaining the current line.

DONE.
