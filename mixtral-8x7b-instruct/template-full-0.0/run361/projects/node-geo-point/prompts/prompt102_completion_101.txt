 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180/Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, while this replacement simply divides 180 by PI, which would give incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y/x) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees using a specific formula, while this replacement uses a different formula that may not give the same results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) * 180 / Math.PI + 540 % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees using a specific formula, while this replacement uses a different formula that includes
