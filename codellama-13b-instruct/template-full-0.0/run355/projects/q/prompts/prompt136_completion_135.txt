  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exception.message` property is a string that contains the error message, whereas the original code fragment `exception` is an object that represents the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exception.stack` property is a string that contains the stack trace of the error, whereas the original code fragment `exception` is an object that represents the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exception.name` property is a string that contains the name of the error, whereas the original code fragment `exception` is an object that represents the error.

DONE.
