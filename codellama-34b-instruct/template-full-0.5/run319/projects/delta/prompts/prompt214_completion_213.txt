  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `ops[0]` returns the first element of the array. If the array has only one element, `slice()` would return an empty array, while `ops[0]` would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes and returns the last element of the array, while `ops[0]` returns the first element of the array. If the array is empty, `pop()` would return `undefined`, while `ops[0]` would return `undefined` or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes and returns the first element of the array, while `ops[0]` returns the first element of the array. If the array is
