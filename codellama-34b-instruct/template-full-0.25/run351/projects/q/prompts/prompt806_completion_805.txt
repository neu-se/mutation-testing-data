  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and a bound set of arguments, which can affect the behavior of the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the callback with a specific `this` value and a set of arguments, which can affect the behavior of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the callback with a specific `this` value and a set of arguments, which can affect the behavior of the callback.

DONE.
