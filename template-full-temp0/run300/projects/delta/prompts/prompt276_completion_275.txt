  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherData = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.retain` to `otherData`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherData = otherOp.delete;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.delete` to `otherData`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherData = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `otherOp.retain` to `otherData`, which is not the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
