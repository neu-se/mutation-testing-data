  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass the same value for the `index` parameter to the `predicate` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, this.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass a different value for the `index` parameter to the `predicate` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass a random value for the `index` parameter to the `predicate` function, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
