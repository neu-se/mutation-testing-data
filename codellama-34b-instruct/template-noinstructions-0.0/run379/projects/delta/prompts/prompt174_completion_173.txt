  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the length of the current operation in the `this` iterator, rather than the minimum of the lengths of the current operations in both iterators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the length of the current operation in the `other` iterator, rather than the minimum of the lengths of the current operations in both iterators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the minimum of the lengths of the current operations in both iterators, rather than just the length of the current operation in one of the iterators.

DONE.
