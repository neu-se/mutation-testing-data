  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!('key' in row)` checks if the `key` property is not defined on the `row` object, while `row.key === undefined` checks if the `key` property is undefined. If the `key` property is defined but has the value `undefined`, the first check would return `false`, while the second check would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row && row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `key` property is defined on the `row` object and if it is undefined. If the `key` property is not defined, the first check would return `false`, while the second check would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof row.key === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof row.key === 'undefined'` checks if the `
