Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nearerValue === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nearerValue` is an object instead of verifying if it is a promise, potentially allowing non-promise objects to be treated as resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nearerValue` is an instance of an Array, which would incorrectly allow arrays to be treated as valid resolved values, even if they are not promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nearerValue` is null, which would bypass the resolution logic for valid promise values, leading to incorrect promise resolution behavior.

DONE.
