  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.delete` is a number, and `0` is a falsy value. In the original code, `lastOp.delete` is compared to `0` using the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality. However, in this new code, `lastOp.delete` is compared to `0` using the `==` operator, which only checks for value equality. This means that if `lastOp.delete` is `0`, the two values will be considered equal, even though they have different types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.delete` is a number, and `0` is a falsy value. In the original code, `lastOp.delete` is compared to `0` using the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality. However, in this new code,
