  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` anchor to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `^` anchor to match the start of the string. This would cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
