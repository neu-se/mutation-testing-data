  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses" for the word "thesis", but the new code fragment would return "these".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses" for the word "thesis", but the new code fragment would return "this".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "theses
