  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would result in a different value for the sine function, which would affect the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `b`. Using `a + b` instead of `b` would result in a different value for the sine function, which would affect the calculation of the complex exponent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `-b` is not the same as `b`. Using `-b` instead of `b` would result in a different value for the sine function, which would affect the calculation of the complex exponent.

DONE.
