  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null`, regardless of the input URL, as the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null`, regardless of the input URL, as the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if the URL does not have a protocol.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null`, regardless of the input URL, as the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` if the URL does not have a host.

DONE.
