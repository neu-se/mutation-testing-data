  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` instead of `abort` when `abort` is truthy. This can potentially cause the test to pass even if the `cb` function is not called correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` instead of `abort` when `abort` is falsy. This can potentially cause the test to pass even if the `cb` function is not called correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with the negation of `abort` instead of `abort`. This can potentially cause the test to pass even if the `cb` function is not called correctly.

DONE.
