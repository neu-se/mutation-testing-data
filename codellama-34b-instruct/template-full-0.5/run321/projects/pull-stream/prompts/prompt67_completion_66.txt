  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `end` is not `null` or `undefined`, regardless of its value. In contrast, the original code fragment `end && end !== true` would only evaluate to `true` if `end` is not `null` or `undefined` and its value is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `end` is not `null` or `undefined`, regardless of its value. In contrast, the original code fragment `end && end !== true` would only evaluate to `true` if `end` is not `null` or `undefined` and its value is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `
