  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return 0 instead of 10, which would cause the `floor` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return -1 instead of 10, which would cause the `floor` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would return Infinity instead of 10, which would cause the `floor` function to return a different value.

DONE.
