  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `ctx`, which is used to determine whether a rule matches a path. Negating the value would cause the rule to always match, regardless of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `name` property of the `ctx` object, which is not a required property in the `QueryContext` class. This would cause the code to throw an error if the `name` property is not present in the `ctx` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.actions
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `actions` property of the `ctx` object, which is not a required property in the `QueryContext` class. This would cause the code to throw an error if the `actions` property is not present in the `ctx` object.

DONE.
