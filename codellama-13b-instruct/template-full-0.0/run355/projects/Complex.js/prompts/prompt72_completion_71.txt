  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not enter the `if` statement if `tokens` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not enter the `if` statement if `tokens` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not enter the `if` statement if `tokens` is `NaN`.

DONE.
