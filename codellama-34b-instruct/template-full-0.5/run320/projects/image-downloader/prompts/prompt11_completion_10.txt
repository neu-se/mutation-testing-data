  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the extension of a file name, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name without the extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(pathname).base
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse(pathname).base` returns the file name without the directory path, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name with the directory path.

DONE.
