  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (exception) {
  return reject(exception);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is not defined in this scope, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (exception) {
  return resolve(exception);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is not defined in this scope, and would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (exception) {
  return Q(exception);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(exception)` creates a rejected promise, but the `promiseDispatch` method is expecting a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
