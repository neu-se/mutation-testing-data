  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Op.length(thisOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of the operation, not the length of the string. In this case, `thisOp.insert` is a string, so `Op.length` would return the length of the string, which is not the same as the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisOp.insert.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` is a string, so `thisOp.insert.length` would return the length of the string, which is not the same as the length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a number, so `thisOp.retain` would return the number of characters to retain, which is not the
