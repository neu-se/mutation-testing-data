  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `object` variable, which may have a different value than `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `object` variable, which may have a different value than `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `object` variable, which may have a different value than `42`.

DONE.
