  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Q.async` function to create an asynchronous generator, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Q.async` function without the `makeGenerator` argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Q.async` function to create an asynchronous generator with the `makeGenerator` argument, while the buggy code fragment uses the `Q.async` function with the `makeGenerator` argument and an empty object as the second argument, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Q.async` function to create an asynchronous generator with the `makeGenerator` argument, while the
