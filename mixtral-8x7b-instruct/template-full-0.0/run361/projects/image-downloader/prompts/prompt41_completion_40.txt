 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `TimeoutError` is not thrown anymore, and the error handling in the calling code would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(error) => console.error(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is not propagated to the promise rejection handler, and the calling code would not be able to handle the error properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(error) => setTimeout(() => console.error(error), 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is not propagated to the promise rejection handler, and the calling code would not be able to handle the error properly. Additionally, the error message is printed to the console after a short delay, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the calling code.

DONE.
