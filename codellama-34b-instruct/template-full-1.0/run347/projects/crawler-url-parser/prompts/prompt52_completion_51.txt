  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.pathname` property is the path component of the URL, excluding the query string, while `parsedUrl` is the entire parsed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.query
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.query` property is the query string component of the URL, while `parsedUrl` is the entire parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.path` property is the path component of the URL, including the query string, while `parsedUrl` is the entire parsed URL object.

DONE.
