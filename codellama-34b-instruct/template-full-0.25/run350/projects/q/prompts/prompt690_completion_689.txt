  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially return a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially return a different array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially return a different array.

DONE.
