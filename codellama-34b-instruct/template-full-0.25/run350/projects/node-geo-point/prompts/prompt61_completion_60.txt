  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `φ2` instead of `φ1` would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the first point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `λ1` instead of `φ1` would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `λ2` instead of `φ1` would result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
