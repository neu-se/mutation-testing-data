  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `Q` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a function, and `Q` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and `Q` is a function.

DONE.
