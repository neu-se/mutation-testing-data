  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value is falsy and would not be caught by the error handling logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is falsy and would not be caught by the error handling logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value is falsy and would not be caught by the error handling logic.

DONE.
