  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the iterator, which would advance the iterator to the next element and return it, whereas the original code fragment only accessed the next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas the original code fragment used the `next()` method to advance the iterator and return the next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment used the `next()` method to access the next element and the `peek()` method to access the next element without advancing
