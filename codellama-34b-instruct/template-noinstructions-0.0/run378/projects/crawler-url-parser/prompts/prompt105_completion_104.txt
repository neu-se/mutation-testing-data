  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `text` variable to lowercase before using it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `text` variable to uppercase before using it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split(' ').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment removes all spaces from the `text` variable before using it.

DONE.
