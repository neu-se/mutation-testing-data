  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections, even if it was not actually handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections, but it would not provide a reference to the promise, making it impossible to find and remove.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(123);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections, but it would provide an invalid reference (123) instead of the actual promise, making it impossible to find and remove.

DONE.
