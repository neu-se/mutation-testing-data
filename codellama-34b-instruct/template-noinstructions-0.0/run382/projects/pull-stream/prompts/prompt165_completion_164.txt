  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment is calling it with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` callback is not being passed to the `abortCb` function. The original code fragment called `abortCb` with the correct arguments, but this new code fragment is calling it with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is being called with an extra argument that it does not expect. The original code fragment called `ab
