  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment prepended 'http://' to the URL, while the new code fragment prepends 'https://'. This change would result in the URL being interpreted as an HTTPS URL, which could cause the application to behave differently if it relies on the specific behavior of the HTTP protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaced the protocol with 'http://', while the new code fragment replaces it with 'localhost'. This change would result in the URL being interpreted as a URL of the form 'localhost/path/to/resource', which could cause the application to behave differently if it relies on the specific behavior of HTTP URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed any '#' characters from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces them with
