  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes no arguments, while `null` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes no arguments, while `undefined` is a primitive value that cannot be called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` is a function that takes no arguments, while `{}` is an empty object that cannot be called as a function.

DONE.
