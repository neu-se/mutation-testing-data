  Sure, here are my answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, which is different from `void 0`, which is the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, while `void 0` is the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `void 0` is the `undefined` value.

DONE.
