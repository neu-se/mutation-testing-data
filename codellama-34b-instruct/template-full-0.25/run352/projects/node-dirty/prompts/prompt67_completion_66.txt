  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error')));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with an error object, which would cause the stream to be destroyed with an error, rather than simply being ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called with a null value, which would cause the stream to be destroyed without an error, rather than simply being ended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called without any arguments, which would cause the stream to be destroyed without an error or a value, rather than simply being ended.

DONE.
