  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (deferred.reject !== deferred.resolve) {
    return deferred.promise;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the nodeArgs are never pushed to the promise chain, so the nodeback would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (deferred.promise.isPending()) {
    return deferred.promise;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would never be resolved or rejected, resulting in a never-ending loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (object instanceof Array) {
    return [];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the object would never be an array, resulting in a never-ending loop.

DONE.
