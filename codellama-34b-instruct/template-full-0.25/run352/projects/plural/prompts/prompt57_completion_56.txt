  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the `y` or `quy` ending with `ies`, while this code fragment would replace it with `ves`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last character of the word and add `ies`, while this code fragment would remove the last character of the word and add `ves`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regex, 'ves'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the `y` or `quy` ending with `ies`, while this code fragment would replace it with `ves`.

DONE.
