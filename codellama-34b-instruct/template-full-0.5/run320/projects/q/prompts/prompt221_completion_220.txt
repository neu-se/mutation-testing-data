  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, whereas `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise, whereas `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise, whereas `object_create` is a function that creates a new object.

DONE.
