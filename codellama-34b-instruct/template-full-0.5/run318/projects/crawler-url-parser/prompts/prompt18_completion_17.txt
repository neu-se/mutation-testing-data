  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the base URL to lowercase, which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the URL is not properly formatted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace the "http" protocol with "https", which could cause the URL parsing to fail if the URL does not support HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the base URL into an array of strings using "/" as the separator, and then the `[0]` index would access the first element of the array, which could be a different URL than the original base URL.

DONE.
