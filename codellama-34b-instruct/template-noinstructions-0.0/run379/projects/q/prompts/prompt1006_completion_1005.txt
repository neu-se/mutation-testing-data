  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid object, but `null` is not, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid object, but `undefined` is not, and would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` is a valid object, but `{}` is an empty object, and would cause the code to throw an error.

DONE.
