  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to `0`, but replacing it with `a + 1` would cause the condition to always be false, even if `a` is equal to `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to `0`, but replacing it with `a - 1` would cause the condition to always be true, even if `a` is not equal to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` is equal to `0`, but replacing it with `a * 2` would cause the condition to always be false, even if `a` is equal to `0`.

DONE.
