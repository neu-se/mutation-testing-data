  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` and `reject` functions are called in a different order than the original code, which could potentially lead to a race condition or other unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(reject, resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` and `reject` functions are swapped, which could potentially lead to a logic error or other unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i - 1]).then(resolve, reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the index `i - 1` is used instead of `i`, which could potentially lead to a different Promise being resolved or rejected.

DONE.
