  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new node resolver, while the replacement code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new node resolver, while the replacement code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new node resolver, while the replacement code fragment creates a new node resolver and binds it to null.

DONE.
