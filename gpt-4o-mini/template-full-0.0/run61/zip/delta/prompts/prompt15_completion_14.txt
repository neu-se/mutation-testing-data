Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat non-object types (like arrays or null) as valid, leading to potential errors in the subsequent logic that assumes `a` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow both `null` and `undefined` values to pass through, which could lead to unexpected results when processing the attributes in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `a` is an array, allowing other non-object types (like strings or numbers) to be treated as valid, which could disrupt the intended functionality of the `diff` method.

DONE.
