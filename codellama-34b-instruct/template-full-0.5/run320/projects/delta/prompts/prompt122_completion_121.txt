  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem` variable is incremented by 1, which would affect the result of the `Op.length()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem` variable is multiplied by 2, which would affect the result of the `Op.length()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `elem` variable is decremented by 1, which would affect the result of the `Op.length()` method.

DONE.
