  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return a `Delta` object with a single op, instead of a `Delta` object with a concatenation of the two input `Delta` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return a `Delta` object with a single op, instead of a `Delta` object with a concatenation of the two input `Delta` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return a `Delta` object with a single op, instead of a `Delta` object with a concatenation of the two input `Delta` objects.

DONE.
