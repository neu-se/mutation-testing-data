  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `null` instead of `cb`, which will result in the `next` function returning `null` instead of a function. This will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
function () {}
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return a new function that does nothing instead of `cb`, which will result in the `next` function returning a new function that does nothing instead of a function. This will cause the `read
