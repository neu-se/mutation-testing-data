  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data)` is a function call, while `tester` is a variable that is expected to be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data, true)` is a function call with an additional argument, while `tester` is a variable that is expected to be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.test(data, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tester.test(data, false)` is a function call with a different argument, while `tester` is a variable that is expected to be a function.

DONE.
