  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert ?? thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because when `thisOp.delete` is not present, it would return `undefined` instead of `otherOp.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert && thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because when `thisOp.delete` is not present, it would return `false` instead of `otherOp.insert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert || thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because when `thisOp.delete` is not present, it would return `otherOp.insert` instead of `undefined`.

DONE.
