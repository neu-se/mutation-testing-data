  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the text, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not convert the text to lowercase, while the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/[^\w\s]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not remove any non-word characters from the text, while the new code fragment does.

DONE.
