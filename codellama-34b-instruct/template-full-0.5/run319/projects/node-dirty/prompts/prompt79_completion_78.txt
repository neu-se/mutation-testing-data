  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code emits an `'error'` event, while the modified code emits a `'warning'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code emits an `'error'` event, while the modified code emits an `'info'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different. The original code emits an `'error'` event, while the modified code emits a `'debug'` event.

DONE.
