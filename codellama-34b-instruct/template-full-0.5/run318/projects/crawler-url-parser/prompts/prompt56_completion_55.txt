  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the second argument would cause the `search` property of the parsed URL to be excluded, which could affect the calculation of the `querycount` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value passed as the third argument would cause the `hash` property of the parsed URL to be included, which could affect the calculation of the `querycount` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `search` and `hash` properties of the parsed URL would be excluded, which could affect the calculation of the `querycount` property.

DONE.
