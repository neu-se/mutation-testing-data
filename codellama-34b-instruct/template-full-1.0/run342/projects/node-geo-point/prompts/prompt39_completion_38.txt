  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) + 360) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is assuming that the argument `θ` is already in degrees, whereas the replaced fragment converts it to degrees before applying the modulo operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) - 360) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is assuming that the argument `θ` is already in degrees, whereas the replaced fragment converts it to degrees before applying the modulo operation, but with a negative 360 degrees offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return rad2deg(θ);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is applying a modulo operation to the argument `θ` before converting it to degrees, whereas the replaced fragment only converts it to degrees.

DONE.
