  `Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let extractedUrl = parsedUrl.split("/");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, whereas the original code fragment returns a string. This could cause the code to behave unexpectedly, especially if it is relying on the format of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl = parsedUrl.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method modifies the original string, whereas the original code fragment creates a new string without modifying the original. This could cause the code to behave unexpectedly, especially if it is relying on the original string being unmodified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl = parsedUrl.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, function(match) {
  return match.toUpperCase();
});
```
This would result in different
