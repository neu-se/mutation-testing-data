  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ1` is the sine of the initial latitude, whereas `sinφ2` is the sine of the final latitude. Using `sinφ1` would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosφ1` is the cosine of the initial latitude, whereas `sinφ2` is the sine of the final latitude. Using `cosφ1` would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1 + φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1 + φ2)` is the sine of the sum of the initial and final latitudes, whereas `sinφ2` is the sine of the final latitude. Using `sin(φ1 + φ2)` would cause the destination point
