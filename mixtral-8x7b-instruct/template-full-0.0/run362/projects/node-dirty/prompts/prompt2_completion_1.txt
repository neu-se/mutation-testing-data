 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFileSync(this.path, 'utf-8')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reads the file synchronously, blocking the execution of further code, while the original code uses a read stream which is non-blocking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream(this.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets the encoding and flags options for the read stream, while this version does not, potentially causing issues with encoding and read permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/' + this.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes the file is located in the same directory as the current module, while the original code uses the provided path directly, which may cause issues if the file is located elsewhere.

DONE.
