 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof isInternalFrame !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `isInternalFrame` instead of its return value, potentially causing the filterStackString function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isInternalFrame(stackLine, qFileName, qStartingLine, qEndingLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function signature of `isInternalFrame`, potentially causing it to behave differently or throw an error if the additional arguments are not expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the check for internal frames with a check for node frames, potentially causing the filterStackString function to behave differently.

DONE.
