  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object is different from the `url` property, and using `baseurl` instead of `url` would cause the code to extract a different set of URLs from the input data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object is different from the `url` property, and using `protocol` instead of `url` would cause the code to extract a different set of URLs from the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property of the `currentUrl` object is different from the `url` property, and using `host` instead of `url` would cause the code to extract a different set of URLs from the input data.

DONE.
