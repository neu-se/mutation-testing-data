  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not defined on the `linkurl` object, and would therefore return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not defined on the `linkurl` object, and would therefore return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pathname` property is not defined on the `linkurl` object, and would therefore return `undefined`.

DONE.
