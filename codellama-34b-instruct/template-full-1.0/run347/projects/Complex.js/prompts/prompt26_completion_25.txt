  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
TypeError
```
This would result in different behavior because `TypeError` is a different type of error than `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid number, but it would not throw an error like `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value, but it would not throw an error like `SyntaxError`.

DONE.
