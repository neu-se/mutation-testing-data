  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the counter to reset to 0 every time the function is called, rather than incrementing it. This would lead to the function returning incorrect results for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to never reach its maximum value, regardless of the input. This would lead to the function returning incorrect results for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the counter to increment by 2 instead of 1, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

DONE.
