  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` will remove characters from the right side of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the left side. This means that the resulting URL may be different, and the request may fail if the URL is not valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` will remove the first character of the string, which may change the URL and cause the request to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.split('').reverse().join('').startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('')` will split the string into an array of individual characters, `reverse()` will reverse the order of the array, and `join('')` will join the array back into a string. This means that the resulting URL may be different, and the request may fail if the URL is
