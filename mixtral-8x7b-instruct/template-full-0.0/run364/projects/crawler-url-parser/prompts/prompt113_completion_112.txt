 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an iterator instead of an array. The `Array.from()` method used in the original code is not necessary when using the spread operator `[...]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlMap.keys()
