  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL parser to treat the entire URL as a path, rather than just the part after the domain name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the path part of the URL, and ignore the protocol and domain name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the host part of the URL, and ignore the path and protocol.

DONE.
