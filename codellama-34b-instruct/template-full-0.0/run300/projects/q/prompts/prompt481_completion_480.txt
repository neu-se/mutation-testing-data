  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array by 1, potentially causing the wrong reason to be removed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array by -1, potentially causing the wrong reason to be removed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the index of the array by 2, potentially causing the wrong reason to be removed from the `unhandledReasons` array.

DONE.
