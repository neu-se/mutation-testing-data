  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `output` variable, which is a `WriteStream` object, to pipe the archived data to. Replacing it with `null` would cause the archived data to be discarded instead of being written to a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('test.txt'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `output` variable to pipe the archived data to a file, but this replacement code would pipe the data to a different file called `test.txt`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `output` variable to pipe the archived data to a file, but this replacement code would pipe the data to the standard output stream instead.

DONE.
