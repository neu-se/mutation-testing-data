  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object instead of the `data` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object instead of the `data` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezonesMap(data.timezones.slice(0, -1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with a slice of the `data.timezones` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.
