Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent a TypeError when `config` is null or undefined, but it would also prevent the function from returning early when `config` is null or undefined, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
defaultConfig
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `defaultConfig` object for the 'extends' property instead of the `config` object, potentially leading to incorrect results if `defaultConfig` has an 'extends' property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the current context (`this`) for the 'extends' property instead of the `config` object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors if `this` does not have an 'extends' property.

DONE.
