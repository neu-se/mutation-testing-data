  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Some other error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message, which would be propagated to any downstream promises that were chained onto the promise returned by `nfapply`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("Some other value")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, which would be propagated to any downstream promises that were chained onto the promise returned by `nfapply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Some other progress")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to emit a different progress notification, which would be propagated to any downstream promises that were chained onto the promise returned by `nfapply`.

DONE.
