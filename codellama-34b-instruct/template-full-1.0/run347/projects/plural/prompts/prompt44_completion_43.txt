  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length-3
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length-3` would refer to the third-to-last character of the string, rather than the second-to-last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length-3, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length-3, 0` would refer to the third-to-last character of the string, rather than the second-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length-4, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length-4, 0` would refer to the fourth-to-last character of the string, rather than the second-to-last character.

DONE.
