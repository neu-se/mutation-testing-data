  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `err` variable would be evaluated first and then the `abort` variable would be evaluated only if `err` is truthy. In the original code, the `||` operator is used to evaluate both `err` and `abort` and return the first truthy value.

DONE.
