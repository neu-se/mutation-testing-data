  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a function that inserts a new element into the delta, while `push` is a function that adds an element to the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a function that removes the last element from the delta, while `push` is a function that adds an element to the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the delta, while `push` adds an element to the end of the delta.

DONE.
