  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for `Q.dispatch`, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument for `Q.dispatch`, but it would cause the method to return a rejected promise with an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return "I'm a very confused placeholder"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function would execute and return the string "I'm a very confused placeholder" each time it is called. This would likely cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the return value of `Q.dispatch`.

DONE.
