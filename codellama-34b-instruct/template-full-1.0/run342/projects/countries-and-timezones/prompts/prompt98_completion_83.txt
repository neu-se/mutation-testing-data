  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would return `false` if `deprecated` is `true`, and `true` if `deprecated` is `false`, resulting in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would return `true` if `deprecated` is `false`, and `false` if `deprecated` is `true`, resulting in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `true` if `deprecated` is `true`, and `false` if `deprecated` is `false`, resulting in the opposite behavior of the original code.

DONE.
