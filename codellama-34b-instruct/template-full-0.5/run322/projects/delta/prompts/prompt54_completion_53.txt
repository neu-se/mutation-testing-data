  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of the `Array.isArray(ops)` check, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `ops` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.constructor === Array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an array is not always guaranteed to be equal to the `Array` constructor function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(ops) === '[object Array]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method of an object can be overridden, potentially causing the result of the check to be different from the original behavior.

DONE.
