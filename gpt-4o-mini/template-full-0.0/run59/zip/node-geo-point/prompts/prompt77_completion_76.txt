Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the bearing to a constant value of 0 degrees, which would always calculate the destination point directly north of the original coordinate, ignoring the actual bearing provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a constant value of 90 degrees (Ï€/2 radians), which would always calculate the destination point directly east of the original coordinate, regardless of the actual bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of the coordinate instead of the bearing, leading to an incorrect calculation of the destination point based on the longitude rather than the intended directional bearing.

DONE.
