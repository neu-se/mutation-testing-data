  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
} else {
    return Q(object).someDummyMethod();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).someDummyMethod()` is not a valid method, and would throw an error, while the original code `Q(object).inspect()` returns a representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
} else {
    return Q(object).inspect(true);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).inspect(true)` would return a verbose representation of the object, while the original code `Q(object).inspect()` returns a concise representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
} else {
    return Q(object).inspect(0);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).inspect(0)` would return a representation of the object with a depth of 0, while the original code `Q(object
