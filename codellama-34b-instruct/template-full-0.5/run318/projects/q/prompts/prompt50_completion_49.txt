  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flushing` variable to always be true, which would cause the `flush()` function to be called repeatedly, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flushing` variable to always be false, which would prevent the `flush()` function from being called, even if it is needed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flushing` variable to always be false, which would prevent the `flush()` function from being called, even if it is needed.

DONE.
