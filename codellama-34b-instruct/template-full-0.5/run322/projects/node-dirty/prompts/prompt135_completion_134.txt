  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` expects a string as input, but `JSON.stringify` returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a constructor function that returns a number, but `JSON.stringify` returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a constructor function that returns a string, but `JSON.stringify` returns a string.

DONE.
