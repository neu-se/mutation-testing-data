 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'none' as const
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the 'none' embed type, even when other embed types are present in the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'unknown' as const
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the 'unknown' embed type, even when other embed types are present in the input. This could lead to incorrect handling of specific embed types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'any' as const
