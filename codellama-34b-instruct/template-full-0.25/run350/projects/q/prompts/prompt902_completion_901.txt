  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called with the `deferred.reject` function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the `fapply` method is successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with an empty function as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the `fapply` method is successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function(error) { console.log(error); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a function that logs the error to the console, but does not reject the promise.

DONE.
