  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).then(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not wait for the "set" operation to complete before returning the value of the "get" operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).catch(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle errors that may occur during the "set" operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).finally(function() {
    return Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not ensure that the "get" operation is
