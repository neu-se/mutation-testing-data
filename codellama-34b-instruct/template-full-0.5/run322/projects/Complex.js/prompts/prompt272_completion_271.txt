  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, whereas `im` is the imaginary part. Using `re` instead of `im` would cause the `arg` function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the `arg` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number would cause the `arg` function to return a different value.

DONE.
