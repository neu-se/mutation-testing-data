  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(value)` is a rejected promise, while `Q(value)` is a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a deferred promise, while `Q(value)` is a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(Q, [value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply(Q, [value])` is a fulfilled promise with the value `[value]`, while `Q(value)` is a fulfilled promise with the value `value`.

DONE.
