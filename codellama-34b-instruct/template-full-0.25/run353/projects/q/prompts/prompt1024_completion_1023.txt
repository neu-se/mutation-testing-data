  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `nodeback` variable, potentially causing the `nodeback` function to be called when it should not be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `nodeback` variable, potentially causing the `nodeback` function to be called with an incorrect argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on the `nodeback` variable with a `null` context, potentially causing the `nodeback` function to be called with an incorrect context.

DONE.
