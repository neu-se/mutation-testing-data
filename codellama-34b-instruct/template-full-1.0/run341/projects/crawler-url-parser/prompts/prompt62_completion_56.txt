  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.query
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `parsedUrl` object's `query` property, which is used to parse the URL's query string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `parsedUrl` object's `hash` property, which is used to parse the URL's fragment identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `parsedUrl` object's `pathname` property, which is used to parse the URL's path.

DONE.
