  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the && operator would always evaluate to true, so the `once` function would be called every time, regardless of whether `end` is true or false. This would result in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the === operator would evaluate to true if `end` is false, which would cause the `once` function to be called every time `end` is false. This would result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the !== operator would evaluate to true if `end` is not true, which would cause the `once` function to be called every time `end` is not true. This would result in an infinite loop.

DONE.
