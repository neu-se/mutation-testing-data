 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the key from a variable to a string literal. The code would no longer use the actual key from the iteration, but instead would always use the string 'key'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.key
