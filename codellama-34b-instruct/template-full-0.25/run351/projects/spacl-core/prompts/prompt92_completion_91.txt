  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method would return a new array containing all elements of `policies` except the first one, which would cause the `for` loop to skip the first policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would return a new array containing only the policies that have a name that is not equal to `'admin'`, which would cause the `for` loop to skip any policies with the name `'admin'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const policy of policies.map(p => ({ name: p.name, value: p.value })))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method would return a new array containing objects with the same properties as the original policies,
