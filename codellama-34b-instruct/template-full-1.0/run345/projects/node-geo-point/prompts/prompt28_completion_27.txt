  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = Math.radians(point1.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of `point1.latitude` using the `Math.radians()` function, which would give a different result than using the `deg2rad()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = point1Rad * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the radian value of `point1.latitude`, which would give a different result than using the `deg2rad()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad = Math.PI / 180 * point1.latitude;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the radian value of `point1.latitude` using the formula `Ï€ / 180 * latitude`, which would give a different result than using the `deg2rad()` function.
