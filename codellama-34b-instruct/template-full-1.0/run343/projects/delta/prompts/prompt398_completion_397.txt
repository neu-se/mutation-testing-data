  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is designed to return a `Delta` object, and returning `null` would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is designed to transform an `other` `Delta` object, and returning `otherOp.delete` would cause the method to return a `Delta` object that is not a transformation of `other`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is designed to transform an `other` `Delta` object, and returning `this.ops.length` would cause the method to return a `Delta` object that is not a transformation of `other`.

DONE.
