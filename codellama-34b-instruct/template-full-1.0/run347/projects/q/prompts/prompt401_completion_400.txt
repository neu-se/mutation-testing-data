  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an additional `then` method call, which could potentially cause the promise to resolve or reject incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the promise chain to use `catch` instead of `then`, which could potentially cause errors to be caught prematurely or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a `then` method call with a no-op function, which could potentially cause the promise to resolve prematurely or not at all.

DONE.
