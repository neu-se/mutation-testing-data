  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `end` is truthy and not equal to `false`. This change would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `end` is `false`, which would result in the `console.warn` statement being executed and the `throw` statement being executed with `end` as the argument, even if `end` is `false`.

DONE.
