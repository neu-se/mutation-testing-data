  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment uses a different substring method, which would produce a different output for words such as "cactus" (which would result in "caciti" instead of "cacti").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ii' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code fragment adds an extra letter "i" to the end of the word, which would produce different outputs for words such as "focus" (which would result in "focii" instead of "focus").

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
