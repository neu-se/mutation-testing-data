  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the return value of the `callback` function, while this modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the original `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the return value of the `callback` function, while this modified code fragment returns a promise that rejects with the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the return value of the `callback` function, while this modified code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the original `value` without passing it
