Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to incorrect calculations for the tangent, as the tangent is defined as the ratio of sine to cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of `a + 1` instead of `a`, which would yield a different value and thus affect the tangent calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the cosine value, which would change the denominator in the tangent calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results or even division by zero if `Math.cos(a)` is -1.

DONE.
