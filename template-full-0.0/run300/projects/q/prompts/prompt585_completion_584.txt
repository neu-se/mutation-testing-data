  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` is a method that rejects a promise with a specified reason, whereas `Q.done` is a method that resolves a promise with a specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method that rejects a promise with a specified reason, whereas `Q.done` is a method that resolves a promise with a specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a method that resolves a promise with a specified value, whereas `Q.done` is a method that resolves a promise with a specified value.

DONE.
