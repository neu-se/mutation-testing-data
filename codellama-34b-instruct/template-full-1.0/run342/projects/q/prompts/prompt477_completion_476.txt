  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the index of `promise` in `unhandledRejections`, which could cause the wrong reason to be removed from `unhandledReasons`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the index of `promise` in `unhandledRejections`, which could cause the wrong reason to be removed from `unhandledReasons`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at | 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a bitwise OR operation on the index of `promise` in `unhandledRejections`, which could cause the wrong reason to be removed from `unhandledReasons`.

DONE.
