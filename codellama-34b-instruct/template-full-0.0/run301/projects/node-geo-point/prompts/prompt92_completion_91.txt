  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `sinθ` and `cosθ` would produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `tanθ` and `cosθ` would produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the calculation of `acosθ` and `cosθ` would produce different results.

DONE.
