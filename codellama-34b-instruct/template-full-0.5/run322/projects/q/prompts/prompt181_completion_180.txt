  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression captures the line number and column number, while the new regular expression only captures the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):\d+\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression captures the line number and column number, while the new regular expression captures the line number and a fixed column number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression captures the line number and column number, while the new regular expression captures the line number and a non-capturing group of the column number.

DONE.
