  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments, and it would also cause the `ended` variable to be set to `true` when it was not set to `true` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the callback to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
