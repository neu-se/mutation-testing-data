  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the value of `b[key]` would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` when comparing the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]`, which would then cause the `diff` function to return a non-empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the value of `b[key]` would cause the `isEqual` function to return `false` when comparing the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]`, which would then cause the `diff` function to return a non-empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the value of `b[key]` would cause
