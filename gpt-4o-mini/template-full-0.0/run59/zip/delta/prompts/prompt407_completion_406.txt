Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
transformedData = { [embedType]: handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority) };
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the priority flag, potentially altering the transformation logic applied to the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
transformedData = { [embedType]: handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], true) };
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the priority flag to always be true, which may not reflect the intended behavior when priority is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
transformedData = { [embedType]: handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], false) };
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the priority flag to false regardless of the original priority, potentially leading to incorrect transformations based on the context.

DONE.
