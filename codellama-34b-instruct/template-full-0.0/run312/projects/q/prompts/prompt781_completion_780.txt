  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject()` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `regardless` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve()` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `regardless` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` would cause the promise to be resolved, whereas `throw new Error("Test error")` would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
