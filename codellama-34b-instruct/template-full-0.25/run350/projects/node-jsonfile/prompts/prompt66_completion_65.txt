  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0000/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a null character at the beginning of the string, rather than the byte order mark (BOM) that the original code fragment matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0001/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a start of heading (SOH) character at the beginning of the string, rather than the BOM that the original code fragment matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\u0002/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a start of text (STX) character at the beginning of the string, rather than the BOM that the original code fragment matches.

DONE.
