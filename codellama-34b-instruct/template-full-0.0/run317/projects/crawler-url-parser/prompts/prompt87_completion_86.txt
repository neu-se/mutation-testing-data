  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code fragment uses the `text` property, which returns the text content of the element, including any child elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method, which removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the text content, while the new code fragment uses a regular expression to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(/\s+/g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method, which removes whitespace from the beginning and end of the text content, while the new code fragment
