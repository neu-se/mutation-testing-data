  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` function would always return `null`, causing the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `invert` method of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` function would always return the number `42`, causing the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `invert` method of `42`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler = function() { return "hello"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getHandler` function would always return the string `"hello"`, causing the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `invert` method of `"hello"`.

DONE.
