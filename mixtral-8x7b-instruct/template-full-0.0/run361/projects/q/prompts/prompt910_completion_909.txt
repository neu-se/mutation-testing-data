 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `this` context as the first argument, changing the arguments array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method from an empty array, which would return an empty array for the `baseArgs` variable, causing unexpected behavior in the returned function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method directly from the `arguments` object, which is not a standard array and does not have the `slice` method. This would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call `slice` on `arguments`.

DONE.
