  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('')
```
This code fragment will split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, which is different from the original code fragment that splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using the `,` character as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(' ').join('')
```
This code fragment will split the `src` string into an array of substrings using the space character as the separator, and then join the substrings back together into a single string with no spaces. This is different from the original code fragment that splits the `src` string into an array of substrings using the `,` character as the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This code fragment will split the `src` string into an array of individual characters, reverse the order of the characters, and then join the characters back together into a single string. This
