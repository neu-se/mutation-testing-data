  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `insert` method to insert the new operation at the beginning of the array instead of the end, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `push` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause the `insert` method to remove the last operation from the array instead of adding a new one, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `push` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. This would cause
