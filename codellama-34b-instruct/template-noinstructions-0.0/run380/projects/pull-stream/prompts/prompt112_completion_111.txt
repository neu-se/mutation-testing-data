  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc, data` is a comma-separated list of two values, but the replacement code fragment `acc, data` is a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc, data` is a comma-separated list of two values, but the replacement code fragment `acc + data` is a single value that is the result of adding `acc` and `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc, data` is a comma-separated list of two values, but the replacement code fragment `acc * data` is a single value that is the result of multiplying `acc` and `data`.

DONE.
