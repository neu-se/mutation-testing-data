  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, while `_readFileAsync` is a different asynchronous function that returns a promise, but with a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, while `_readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the file contents directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, while `_writeFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, but with a different implementation.

DONE.
