  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `replace` method, which would remove any characters after the first semicolon in the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `slice` method, which would remove the last character of the `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split(';')[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not include the `split` method, which would split the `href` attribute into an array of substrings using the semicolon as a delimiter, and then return the first element of the array.

DONE.
