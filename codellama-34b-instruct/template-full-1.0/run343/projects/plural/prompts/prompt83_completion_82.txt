  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a singular form of the word "mouse" and returns the plural form "mice" while the new code fragment returns the singular form "mouse".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'rats'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a singular form of the word "mouse" and returns the plural form "mice" while the new code fragment returns the plural form "rats".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bird'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a singular form of the word "mouse" and returns the plural form "mice" while the new code fragment returns the singular form "bird".

DONE.
