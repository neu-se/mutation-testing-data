  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [], all: [""] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` array now contains an empty string, while the original code fragment did not. This change would cause the `buildCountry` function to treat the empty string as a valid time zone, when in fact it is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [""], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` array now contains an empty string, while the original code fragment did not. This change would cause the `buildCountry` function to treat the empty string as a valid time zone, when in fact it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [undefined], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` array now contains `undefined`, while the original code fragment did not. This change would cause the `
