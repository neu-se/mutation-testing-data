  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code fragment converts the `path` variable to lowercase before passing it to the `rule.query()` method. This could potentially cause the `rule.query()` method to return a different result, depending on the specific implementation of the method and the values of the `path` and `verb` variables.
