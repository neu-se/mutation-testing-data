  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') or $
```
This would result in different behavior because the first expression will select the `href` attribute of the `base` element, while the second expression will select all `base` elements and retrieve their `href` attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').get(0).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.get(0)` method will retrieve the first element in the selection, while the `.attr('href')` method will retrieve the `href` attribute of the selected element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').map((i, el) => el.attr('href')).get()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.map()` method will iterate over the selection and retrieve the `href` attribute of each element, while the `.get()` method will retrieve the resulting array.

DONE.
