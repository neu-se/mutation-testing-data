  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which is unnecessary and does not affect the behavior of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array that is the concatenation of the original `args` array and itself, which changes the number of arguments passed to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.every()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `every()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the array satisfy the provided testing function. It does not produce the same result as the original code fragment, which retrieves the value of the first element in the array.

DONE.
