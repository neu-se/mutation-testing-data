Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with an empty array instead of the array of fulfilled promises, potentially leading to incorrect results when the caller expects the original array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(pendingCount);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the count of pending promises instead of the array of fulfilled promises, which would not provide the expected values to the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Some error occurred"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with a new error instead of resolving it with the array of fulfilled promises, which would disrupt the intended flow of handling fulfilled promises.

DONE.
