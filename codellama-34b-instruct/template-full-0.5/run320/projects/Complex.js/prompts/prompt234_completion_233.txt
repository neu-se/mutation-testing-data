  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator, while this new code fragment uses the less than operator. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` for inputs that are strictly less than 0, while the original code fragment would return `true` for inputs that are less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `a` is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks whether `a` is not equal to 0. This means that the new code fragment would return `true` for inputs that are not equal to 0, while the original code fragment would return `true` for inputs that are less than or equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original
