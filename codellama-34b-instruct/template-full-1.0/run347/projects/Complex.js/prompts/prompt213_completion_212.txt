  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 changes the result of the logarithm. The original code calculates the natural logarithm of `a`, while the modified code calculates the natural logarithm of `a + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the reference to `b` introduces a new variable into the code. The original code only references `a`, while the modified code also references `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `b` changes the result of the logarithm. The original code calculates the natural logarithm of `a`, while the modified code calculates the natural logarithm of `a - b`.

DONE.
