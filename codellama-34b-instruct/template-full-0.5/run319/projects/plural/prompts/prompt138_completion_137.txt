  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return w + 'es'` would not replace the letter "y" with "ves" if it was not preceded by a consonant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace(regex, 'ves') + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return w + 'es'` would not add an extra "es" to the end of the word if it was not preceded by a consonant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return w.replace(regex, 'ves') + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return w + 'es'` would not add an extra "es" to the end of the word if it was not preceded by a consonant.

DONE.
