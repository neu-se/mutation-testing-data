 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an argument, and passing `null` would not provide the expected error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is not a function, and the `when` function expects a function as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return; }
