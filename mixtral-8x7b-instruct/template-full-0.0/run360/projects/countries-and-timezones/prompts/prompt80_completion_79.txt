 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'constant'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the country for the constant string 'constant' instead of the provided timezone name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an integer to the getTimezone function, which expects a string as an argument, and would result in unexpected behavior or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a random float number to the getTimezone function, which expects a string as an argument, and would result in unexpected behavior or an error.

DONE.
