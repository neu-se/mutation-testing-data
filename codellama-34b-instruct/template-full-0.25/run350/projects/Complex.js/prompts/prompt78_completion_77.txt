  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first token.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would stop at the second-to-last token instead of the last token, potentially missing the last token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last token and count down to the first token, potentially causing the loop to execute in reverse order.

DONE.
