  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `thisp`, whereas `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided individually, whereas `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(thisp).apply(thisp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value bound to `thisp`, and then `apply` calls the function with the specified `this` value and arguments provided as an array. This is equivalent to calling `callback.apply(thisp)` directly.
