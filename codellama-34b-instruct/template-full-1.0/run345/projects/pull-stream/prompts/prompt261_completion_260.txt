  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a callback function to be called with an error object, but with this change, the callback function will be called with a null value instead, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a callback function to be called with an error object, but with this change, the callback function will be called with no argument, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting a callback function to be called with an error object, but with this change, the callback function will be called with no argument, which may cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
