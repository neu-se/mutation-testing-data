  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, and the first element of the array would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from -1 instead of 0, and the last element of the array would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * tokens.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a random index instead of 0, and the order of the elements would be randomized.

DONE.
