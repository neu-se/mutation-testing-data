  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `promises` as the resolved value of the deferred promise, while this code fragment uses an empty array `[]`. This would cause the `allResolved` method to always return an array of promises, even if some of the promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `promises` as the resolved value of the deferred promise, while this code fragment uses `undefined`. This would cause the `allResolved` method to always return `undefined`, even if some of the promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `promises` as the resolved value of the deferred promise, while this code fragment uses a new error object. This would cause the `allResolved` method to always return an error object, even if some
