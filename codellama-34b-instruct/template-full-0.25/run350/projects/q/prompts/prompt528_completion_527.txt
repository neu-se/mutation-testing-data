  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound `this` value, which would change the behavior of the `inspect` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the `inspect` method immediately, which would change the behavior of the `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the `inspect` method immediately, which would change the behavior of the `inspect` method.

DONE.
