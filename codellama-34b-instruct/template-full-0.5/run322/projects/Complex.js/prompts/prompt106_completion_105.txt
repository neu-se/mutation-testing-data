  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a no-op, while this new code fragment would actually call the `parser_exit()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a no-op, while this new code fragment would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a no-op, while this new code fragment would return a `Complex` object with the value `NaN`.

DONE.
