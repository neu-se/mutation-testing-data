  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Mutation testing error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `catch` block and handled differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Mutation testing error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to throw an error, which would be caught by the `catch` block and handled differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `runSingle` function to return 0, which would be different than the original code that returns the result of the `task` function.

DONE.
