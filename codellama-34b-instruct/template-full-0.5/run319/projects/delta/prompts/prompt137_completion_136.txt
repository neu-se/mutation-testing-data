  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` property of `firstOther` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` property of `firstOther` is `null`, while this code fragment checks if it is an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `attributes` property of `firstOther` is `
