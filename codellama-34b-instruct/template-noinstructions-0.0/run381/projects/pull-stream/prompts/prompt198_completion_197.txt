  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the `abort` error to the callback, while the new code fragment `null` would pass `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the `abort` error to the callback, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the `abort` error to the callback, while the new code fragment `throw new Error('abort')` would throw an error instead.

DONE.
