  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
apply.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is called twice, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
