  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces the first occurrence of a substring in a string, whereas `match` is a method that searches for a match in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that searches for a match in a string, whereas `match` is a method that searches for a match in a string and returns the match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, whereas `match` is a method that searches for a match in a string and returns the match.

DONE.
