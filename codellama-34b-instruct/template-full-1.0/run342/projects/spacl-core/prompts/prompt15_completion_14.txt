  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression that matches any character (including `/`) followed by the end of the string, while this replacement uses a regular expression that matches any character (excluding `/`) followed by the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression that matches any character (including `/`) followed by the end of the string, while this replacement uses a regular expression that matches any character (excluding `/`) followed by the end of the string, and also includes the `g` flag to perform a global match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a regular expression that matches any character (including `/`) followed by the end of the string, while this
