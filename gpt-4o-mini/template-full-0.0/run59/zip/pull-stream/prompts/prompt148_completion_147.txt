Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, rather than its keys, which would lead to a different output when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, which is a different structure compared to the array of keys returned by `Object.keys`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` returns an array of all properties (including non-enumerable properties) found directly upon a given object, which may include properties that `Object.keys` would not return.

DONE.
