  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `φ1` is the latitude of the origin point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `λ1` is the longitude of the origin point, while `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, while `φ2` and `λ2` are variables representing the latitude and longitude of the destination point.

DONE.
