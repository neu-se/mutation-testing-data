  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object)` is a function call, while `Q` is a variable reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q['return']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q['return']` is a property access, while `Q` is a variable reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q['return']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q['return']()` is a function call, while `Q` is a variable reference.

DONE.
