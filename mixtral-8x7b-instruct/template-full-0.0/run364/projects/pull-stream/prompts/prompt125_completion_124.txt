 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to the callback function would change from the boolean `end` to the current value of the counter variable `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to the callback function would be the next value of the counter variable `i`, rather than the current value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to the callback function would be a random number between 0 and 1, rather than the expected value of `end` or the counter variable `i`.

DONE.
