  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.NODE_ENV
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.NODE_ENV` is a string and `process.toString` would be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.versions.node
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.versions.node` is a string representing the version number of Node.js and `process.toString` would be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.execArgv.pie
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.execArgv.pie` does not exist.

DONE.
