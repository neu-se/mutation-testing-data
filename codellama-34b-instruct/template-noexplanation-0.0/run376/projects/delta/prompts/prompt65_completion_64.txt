  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to insert a null value instead of the intended string or object. This will likely cause errors in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to insert an undefined value instead of the intended string or object. This will likely cause errors in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = NaN;
```
This change will cause the `insert` method to insert a NaN value instead of the intended string or object. This will likely cause errors in the code that uses the `Delta` class.

DONE.
