  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  "arguments" + "/0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code tries to access the arguments object of the surrounding function, but instead of using the array methods, it adds "/0" to the string "arguments", which is not a valid property accessor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  "args" + "[0]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code tries to concatenate the string "args" with a key accessor for the first element of the arguments array, which does not exist as a property of the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  "args /0/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code tries to divide the string "args" by the number 0, which is not a valid operation.

DONE.
