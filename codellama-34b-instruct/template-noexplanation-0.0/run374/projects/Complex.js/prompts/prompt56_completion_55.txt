  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] + 1
```
This change will cause the `Math.sin` function to be called with a different argument, which may result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] * 2
```
This change will cause the `Math.sin` function to be called with a different argument, which may result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] - 1
```
This change will cause the `Math.sin` function to be called with a different argument, which may result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
