  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `deg2rad` function to return a value that is one less than the actual radian value of the input angle. This would cause the `calculateBearing` function to calculate the bearing with a different angle, potentially leading to a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `deg2rad` function to return a value that is one higher than the actual radian value of the input angle. This would cause the `calculateBearing` function to calculate the bearing with a different angle, potentially leading to a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `deg2rad` function to return a
