 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now wrapped in a resolved promise, so it won't be invoked immediately. Instead, it will be invoked in the next tick, which might cause tests that expect immediate execution to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now wrapped in a Q-specific resolved promise, which might have different behavior than the original callback. This could cause tests that are tightly coupled to the Q implementation to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback().then(identity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now immediately invoked and then passed through a `then` call with the `identity` function. This could cause tests that expect a certain order of execution to fail, as well as tests that expect the callback to be a function and not a promise.
