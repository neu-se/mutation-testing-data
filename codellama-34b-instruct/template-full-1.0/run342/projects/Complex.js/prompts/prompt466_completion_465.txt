  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b === 0` check in the original code is checking for equality, while this suggestion checks for inequality. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `b` is not equal to `0`, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === 0` checks whether `b` is equal to `0`, while `Number.isNaN(b)` checks whether `b` is a number that is `NaN`. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `b` is not a number, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === 0` checks whether `b` is equal to `0`, while `!
