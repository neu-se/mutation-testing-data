  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, potentially changing the behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, potentially changing the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a different argument, potentially changing the behavior of the method.

DONE.
