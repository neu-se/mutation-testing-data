  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` returns an object with properties `state` and `value`, and `promise.inspect.rejected` would return `undefined`, causing the `allSettled` method to return a promise that is never resolved or rejected.

DONE.
