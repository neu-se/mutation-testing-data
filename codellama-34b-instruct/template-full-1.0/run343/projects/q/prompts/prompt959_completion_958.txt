  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Array()
```
This would result in different behavior because while `array_slice` is a function that creates a shallow copy of a part of an array, `new Array()` creates a new array with zero elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var zero = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because while `array_slice` is a function that creates a shallow copy of a part of an array, `var zero = 0` creates a variable `zero` with the value `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because while `array_slice` is a function that creates a shallow copy of a part of an array, `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number".

DONE.
