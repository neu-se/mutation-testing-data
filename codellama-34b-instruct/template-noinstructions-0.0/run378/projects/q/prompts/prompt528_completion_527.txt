  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `inspect` method on the `object` directly, which would bypass any custom `inspect` method defined on the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls the `inspect` method on the `object` directly, which would bypass any custom `inspect` method defined on the `Q` object.

DONE.
