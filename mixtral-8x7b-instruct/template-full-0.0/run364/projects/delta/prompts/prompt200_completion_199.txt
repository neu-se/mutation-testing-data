 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.rest().length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `length` property of the rest of the `thisIter` iterator, instead of slicing the `ops` array with the `slice` method. This change may cause issues if the iterator has side effects or if the length of the rest of the iterator is not equivalent to the length of the sliced array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.rest().slice(0).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by calling `slice(0)` on the rest of the `thisIter` iterator, and then gets the length of that array. This change may cause performance issues due to the unnecessary array creation, and it may not behave the same way as the original code if the iterator has side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * (thisIter.hasNext() ?
