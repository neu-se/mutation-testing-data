 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./path'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path string to a relative file path, which would not match any rules in the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `path` property from the `ctx` object, which may not have the same value as the `path` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, ctx).toString()
