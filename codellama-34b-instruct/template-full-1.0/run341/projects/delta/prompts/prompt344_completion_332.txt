  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType += 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` would be incremented before being used as the key for the embed object, which could result in the embed object being stored under a different key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` would be set to `null` before being used as the key for the embed object, which could result in the embed object not being stored at all or being stored under a different key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` would be set to a random integer between 0 and 9 before being used as the key for the embed object, which could result in the embed object being stored under a different key or not at all.

DONE.
