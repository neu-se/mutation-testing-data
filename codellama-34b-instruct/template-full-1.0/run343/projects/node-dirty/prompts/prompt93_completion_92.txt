  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('An empty line indicates a corrupted database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for empty lines in a healthy database, while this modification checks for empty lines in a corrupted database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database is not healthy')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for empty lines in a healthy database, while this modification simply reports that the database is not healthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database is missing data')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for empty lines in a healthy database, while this modification simply reports that the database is missing data.

DONE.
