  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` would return the absolute value of `a`, whereas `a['arg']` returns the argument of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['re']` would return the real part of `a`, whereas `a['arg']` returns the argument of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['im']` would return the imaginary part of `a`, whereas `a['arg']` returns the argument of `a`.

DONE.
