  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a null value, whereas `defer` creates a new deferred object with an undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(false)` creates a new deferred object with a boolean value of false, whereas `defer` creates a new deferred object with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(defer())` creates a new deferred object with a deferred value, whereas `defer` creates a new deferred object with an undefined value.

DONE.
