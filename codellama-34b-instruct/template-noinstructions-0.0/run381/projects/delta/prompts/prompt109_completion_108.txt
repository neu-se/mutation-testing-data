  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => !op
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, but the new code fragment would filter the array based on the negation of the `predicate` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, but the new code fragment would filter the array based on the `retain` property of each `op` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op) => op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `predicate` function to filter the `ops` array, but the new code fragment would filter the array based on the `insert` property of each `op` object.

DONE.
