  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds the number down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds the number up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds the number to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of the number.

DONE.
