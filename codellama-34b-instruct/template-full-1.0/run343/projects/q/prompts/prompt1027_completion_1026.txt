  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` will always be truthy, even if it's a function that returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nodeback === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeback` might be a non-function value, and `typeof` will return `object` or `undefined` in those cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(nodeback) === '[object Function]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString.call` can detect whether a value is a function, regardless of its origin.

DONE.
