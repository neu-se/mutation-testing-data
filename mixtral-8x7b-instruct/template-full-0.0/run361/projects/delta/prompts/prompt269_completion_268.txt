 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new Delta().chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new, empty Delta object and calls `chop()` on it, instead of using the `retDelta` variable that was defined earlier in the function. This would effectively discard the changes made to `retDelta` and return an empty Delta object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.chop()
