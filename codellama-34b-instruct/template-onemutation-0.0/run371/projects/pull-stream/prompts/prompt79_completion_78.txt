  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `next()`, which would call the `next` function with no arguments, while `next(null)` would call the `next` function with a `null` argument. This could potentially cause the `next` function to behave differently, depending on how it was implemented.

DONE.
