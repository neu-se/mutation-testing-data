  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `in` operator, which checks if the index is less than the length of the array, while this new code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the index exceeds the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `in` operator, which checks if the index is less than the length of the array, while this new code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the index is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `in` operator, which checks if the index is less than the length of the array, while this new code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the index is equal to the length of the array.

DONE.
