  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the third argument, instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the fourth argument, instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the second argument and ending at the third argument, instead of slicing from the second argument to the end.

DONE.
