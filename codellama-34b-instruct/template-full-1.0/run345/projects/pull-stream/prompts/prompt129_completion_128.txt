  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `i++` as the second argument to the `cb` function, while this change passes `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `i++` as the second argument to the `cb` function, while this change passes `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `i++` as the second argument to the `cb` function, while this change passes `0`.

DONE.
