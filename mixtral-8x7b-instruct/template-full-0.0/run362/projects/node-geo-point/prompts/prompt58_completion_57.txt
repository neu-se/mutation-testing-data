 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the correct way to access the sine function in JavaScript, while `sin` is a shorthand that only works when `Math` is already in scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sin
