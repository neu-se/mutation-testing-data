Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("Error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the error, it resolves the promise with a string indicating an error, which changes the promise's state to fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("All promises were rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error with a specific message instead of using the original error, which may lead to loss of context about the original rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a progress notification with the rejection object instead of rejecting the promise, which means the promise would not be marked as rejected and would not trigger any rejection handlers.

DONE.
