  Sure, here are three options to replace the `PLACEHOLDER` with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
call.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid `this` value, and `call()` expects a function as its first argument. Using `undefined` will throw a `TypeError` in the `call()` method.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
call.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined`, and `call()` will not be able to find the specified function in the `null` context.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
call.apply({}, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object will not have a `call()` method, and the code will throw an error.

DONE.
