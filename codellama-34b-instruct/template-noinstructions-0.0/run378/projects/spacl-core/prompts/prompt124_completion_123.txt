  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `undefined` is not a string. In the original code, `match` is compared to `null`, which is a valid value for a string. However, `undefined` is not a valid value for a string, and comparing `match` to `undefined` would result in a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a string, and `match.length` is the length of the string. In the original code, `match` is compared to `null`, which is a valid value for a string. However, `match.length` is not a valid value for a string, and comparing `match` to `match.length` would result in a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.indexOf('') === 0
```
This would result in different
