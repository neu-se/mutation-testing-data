  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `0 === d` checks whether `d` is equal to zero, while `d !== 0` checks whether `d` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `0 === d` checks whether `d` is equal to zero, while `d == 0` checks whether `d` is equal to zero, but would return `true` if `d` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the test `0 === d` checks whether `d` is equal to zero, while `true` always returns `true`, regardless of the value of `d`.

DONE.
