  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `src.slice(1)` would return a new string that is a substring of the original `src` string, starting from the second character. In contrast, `src` on its own would return the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `src.toUpperCase()` would return a new string that is the same as the original `src` string, but with all characters in uppercase. In contrast, `src` on its own would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `src.length` would return the length of the `src` string, which could be different from the original string. In contrast, `src` on its own would return the original string.

DONE.
