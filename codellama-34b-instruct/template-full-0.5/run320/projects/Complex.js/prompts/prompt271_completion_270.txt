  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['re'], this['im']) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Math.atan2` is called with the arguments swapped, and the result is then added to `Math.PI`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['re'], this['im']) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `Math.atan2` is called with the arguments swapped, and the result is then subtracted from `Math.PI`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
