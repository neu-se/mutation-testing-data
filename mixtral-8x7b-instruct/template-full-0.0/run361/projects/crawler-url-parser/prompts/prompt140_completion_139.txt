 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\.[a-z]+$/i'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a case-insensitive match, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\\.[a-z]+$/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it escapes the backslash, making it a literal character in the regular expression, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/default\.[a-z]+$/g'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the global flag 'g', causing the regular expression to match all occurrences instead of stopping after the first match, which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
