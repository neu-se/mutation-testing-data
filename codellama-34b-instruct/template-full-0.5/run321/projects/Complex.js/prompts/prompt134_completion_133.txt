  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which checks if either operand is truthy. However, the replaced code fragment uses the `&&` operator, which checks if both operands are truthy. This means that the replaced code fragment would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are truthy, whereas the original code fragment would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either operand is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which checks if either operand is truthy. However, the replaced code fragment uses the `&&` operator, which checks if both operands are truthy. This means that the replaced code fragment
