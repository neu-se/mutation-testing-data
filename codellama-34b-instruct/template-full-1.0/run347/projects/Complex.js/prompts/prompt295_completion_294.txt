  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` computes the hyperbolic sine, which is different from the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.asin` computes the arcsine, which is different from the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the input value `c` by the sine of some other angle, instead of just computing the sine of the input value.

DONE.
