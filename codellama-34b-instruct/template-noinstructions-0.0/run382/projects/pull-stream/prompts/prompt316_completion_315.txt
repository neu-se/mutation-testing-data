  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` would call the `terminate` function, which would set `last` to `false` and call `cb` with an error or `true`. In contrast, `cb(null, data)` would call `cb` with `null` as the error and `data` as the data, which would not set `last` to `false` and would not call `cb` with an error or `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate` would call the `terminate` function, which would set `last` to `false` and call `cb` with an error or `true`. In contrast, `cb(ended)` would call `cb` with `ended` as the error, which would not set `last` to `false` and would not call `cb` with an error or `true`.
