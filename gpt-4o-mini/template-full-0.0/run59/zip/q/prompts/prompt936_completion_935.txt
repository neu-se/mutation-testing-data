Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseArgs` to always be an empty array, effectively ignoring any arguments passed to the `nbind` function, which would lead to incorrect behavior when trying to bind the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseArgs` to include the context of the current `Promise` instance instead of the intended arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results when the bound function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the second argument passed to the `nbind` function, ignoring the first argument (the callback function) and potentially causing the bound function to be undefined or incorrect.

DONE.
