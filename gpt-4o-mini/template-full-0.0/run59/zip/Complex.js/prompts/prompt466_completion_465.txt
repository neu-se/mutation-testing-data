Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part as real numbers, leading to incorrect string representations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only treat complex numbers as real if the real part is exactly 1, which is not the intended logic for identifying real numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify complex numbers as real based on the sign of the imaginary part, rather than checking if it is zero, leading to erroneous outputs.

DONE.
