  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement checks if it is not `null`. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.attributes` is not `null`, as the replacement code would execute the `retain` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.attributes` is `null`, while this replacement checks if it is `null`. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.attributes` is `null`, as the replacement code would not execute the `retain` block.
