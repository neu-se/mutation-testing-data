  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `false` regardless of the input, which would indicate that the policy is not allowing any actions on any paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `null` regardless of the input, which would indicate that the policy is not governing any actions on any paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `undefined` regardless of the input, which would indicate that the policy is not allowing any actions on any paths.

DONE.
