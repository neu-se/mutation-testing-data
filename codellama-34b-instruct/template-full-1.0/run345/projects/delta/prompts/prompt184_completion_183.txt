  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `retain` property of the `thisOp` object is a string, whereas the original code is checking if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain instanceof Number
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `retain` property of the `thisOp` object is an instance of the `Number` class, whereas the original code is checking if it is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `retain` property of the `thisOp` object is a boolean, whereas the original code is checking if it is a number.

DONE.
