  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would have a different value for `array[i++]` than the original code, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would have a different value for `i` than the original code, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would have a different value for `array.length` than the original code, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
