  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the outcome of the original code, causing the `if` statement to execute even if the object has the `coordinates` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object has a property called `coordinates` instead of checking if the `coordinates` property is an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `coordinates` property has a length of 2 instead of checking if it's an array.

DONE.
