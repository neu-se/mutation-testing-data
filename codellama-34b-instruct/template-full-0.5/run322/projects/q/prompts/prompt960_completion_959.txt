  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
