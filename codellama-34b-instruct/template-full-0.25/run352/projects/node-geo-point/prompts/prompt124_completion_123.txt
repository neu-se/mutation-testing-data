  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the longitude of the current point and the latitude of the destination point, instead of the bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the longitude of the destination point and the latitude of the current point, instead of the bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the latitude of the current point and the longitude of the destination point, instead of the bearing between the two points.

DONE.
