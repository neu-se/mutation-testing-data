  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the contents of `otherOp` into `retDelta` instead of deleting them, which would change the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the contents of `otherOp` in `retDelta` instead of deleting them, which would change the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the contents of `otherOp` in `retDelta` but with a length of 0, which would change the resulting delta.

DONE.
