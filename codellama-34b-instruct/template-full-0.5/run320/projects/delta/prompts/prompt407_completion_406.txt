  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` argument is inverted, which would cause the transformation to behave differently when `priority` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the transformation to behave differently when `priority` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` argument is always `true`, which would cause the transformation to behave differently when `priority` is `false`.

DONE.
