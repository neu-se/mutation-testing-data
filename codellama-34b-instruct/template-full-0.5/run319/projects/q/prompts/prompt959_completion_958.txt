  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `array_slice` to extract a portion of the array, but the replaced code fragment is using `array_slice.reverse()` to extract a portion of the array in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `array_slice` to extract a portion of the array, but the replaced code fragment is using `array_slice.sort()` to extract a portion of the array in sorted order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `array_slice` to extract a portion of the array, but the replaced code fragment is using `array_slice.splice(0, 1)` to extract a portion of the array starting from the
