Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` calculates the cube root instead of the square root, which would lead to incorrect results when computing the square root of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly computes the square root of the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the magnitude of the complex number, leading to erroneous results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.abs(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the square root of the absolute value of the real part only, ignoring the imaginary part and potentially yielding incorrect results for complex numbers with non-zero imaginary components.

DONE.
