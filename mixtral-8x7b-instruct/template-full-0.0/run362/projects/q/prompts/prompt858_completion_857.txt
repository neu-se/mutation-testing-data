 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would be called with a promise object instead of a timeout ID, which could potentially cause the timeout to not be cleared even if the promise is fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would always be called with 0, which would have no effect and the timeout would not be cleared even if the promise is fulfilled before the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would be called with the deferred object instead of the timeout ID, which could potentially cause an error as `clearTimeout` expects a number as its argument.

DONE.
