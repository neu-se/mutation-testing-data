 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the standard way to get the `slice` method in modern JavaScript, while `array_slice` is an atypical name that might not be present in some environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so calling it with arguments will throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a function that always returns `42`, rather than the expected `slice` method. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be truncated to a single element, `42`, which would likely cause errors in the Node.js callback.

DONE.
