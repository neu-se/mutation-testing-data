  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `pop` removes an element from the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `shift` removes an element from the beginning of an array.

DONE.
