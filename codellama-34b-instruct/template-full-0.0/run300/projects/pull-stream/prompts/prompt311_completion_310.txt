  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, while `null` is a null value. If the `read` function is expecting a non-null value, it may throw an error or produce unexpected results when given a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a value. If the `read` function is expecting a defined value, it may throw an error or produce unexpected results when given an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` parameter of the `read` function, while `0` is a number value that
