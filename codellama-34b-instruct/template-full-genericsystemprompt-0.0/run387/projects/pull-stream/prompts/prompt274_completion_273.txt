  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only allows reading from the original stream once, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that allows reading from the original stream multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(once)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stream.pipe` is a method that pipes the data from the original stream to the `once` stream, whereas the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that allows reading from the original stream multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(stream, { objectMode: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` with the `objectMode` option set to `true` will only allow reading from the original stream once, whereas the original code fragment `once` without the `objectMode` option set will allow reading
