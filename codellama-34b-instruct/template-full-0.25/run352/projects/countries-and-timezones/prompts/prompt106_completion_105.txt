  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if `country` is falsy, while `country === null` checks if `country` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if `country` is falsy, while `country !== undefined` checks if `country` is not strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if `country` is falsy, while `country.length === 0` checks if `country` is an empty string or an empty array.

DONE.
