  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'die')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this replacement would not add any new rules and would therefore not change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this replacement would add a new rule that would cause the function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "die".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, while this replacement would add a new rule that would cause the function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "die".

DONE.
