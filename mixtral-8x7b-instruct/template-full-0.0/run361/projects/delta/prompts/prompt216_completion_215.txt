 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations in the `other` Delta would be reversed, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.filter(op => op.type !== 'delete')
