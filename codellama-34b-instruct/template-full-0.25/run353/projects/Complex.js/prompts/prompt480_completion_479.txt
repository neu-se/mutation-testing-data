  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a method that checks if the complex number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere, while `isNaN` is a method that checks if the complex number is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `im` is the imaginary part of the complex number, and checking if it is equal to 0 would result in a different outcome than checking if the complex number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is the real part of the complex number, and checking if it is equal to 0 would result in a different outcome than checking if the complex number is not a number.

DONE.
