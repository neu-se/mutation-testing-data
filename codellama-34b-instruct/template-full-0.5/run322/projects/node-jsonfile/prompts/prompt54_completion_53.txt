  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return a string with a single space character, instead of a string with `spaces` number of space characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return a string with a `null` value, instead of a string with `spaces` number of space characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method would return a string with an `undefined` value, instead of a string with `spaces` number of space characters.

DONE.
