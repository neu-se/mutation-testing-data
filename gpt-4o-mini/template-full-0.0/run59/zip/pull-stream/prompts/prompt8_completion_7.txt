Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object instead of the `sinks` object, leading to the wrong properties being exported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks2
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent variable `sinks2`, which would cause a reference error instead of exporting the intended `sinks` properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinks.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `length` property of the `sinks` object, which is likely undefined, leading to an incorrect assignment and potentially breaking the functionality.

DONE.
