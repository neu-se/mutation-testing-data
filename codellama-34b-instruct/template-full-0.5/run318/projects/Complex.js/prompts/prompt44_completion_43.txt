  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `b` to be `null`, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined || b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `b` to be either `undefined` or `null`, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `b` to be any value other than `0`, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

DONE.
