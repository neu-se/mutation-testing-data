  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if 0 is equal to `d`. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `d` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is not equal to 0, while this replacement checks if 0 is not equal to `d`. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `d` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `d` is equal to 0 using the strict equality operator (`===`), while this replacement checks if `d` is equal to 0 using the abstract equality operator (`==`). This change would cause the code to behave
