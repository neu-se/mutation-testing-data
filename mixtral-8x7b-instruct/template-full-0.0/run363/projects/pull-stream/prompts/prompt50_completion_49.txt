 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `s` is an instance of the `Function` constructor, rather than checking if `s` is a function using the `typeof` operator. This might not catch some edge cases where `s` is a function but not an instance of `Function`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof s
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the position of the type string and the variable, which could potentially cause issues if the type string is accidentally changed or misspelled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor.name === 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `constructor.name` property of `s` is equal to 'Function', which might not work as expected if the function was defined in a non-standard way (e.g., using `Function.prototype.bind`).
