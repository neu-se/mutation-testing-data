  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
absoluteUrl.replace(/\/+(?:=)*/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes additional forward slashes and equal signs after the domain name, which may not be desired.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('url').resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the URL with respect to the base URL, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ ...absoluteUrl, pathname: absoluteUrl.pathname.replace(/^\/?/, "/") }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a leading forward slash to the pathname if it is missing, which may not be desired.

DONE.
