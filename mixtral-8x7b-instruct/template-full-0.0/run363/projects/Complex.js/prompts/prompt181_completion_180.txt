 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0 && z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for real and imaginary parts being zero, instead of checking if the complex number is zero using the `isZero()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the current complex number's real and imaginary parts being zero, instead of checking if the complex number `z` is zero using the `isZero()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `Complex['ONE']` regardless of the input, whereas the original code calculates the power based on the input complex number `z`.

DONE.
