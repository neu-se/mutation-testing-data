 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result would be flipped, which is not equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the square root of the absolute value of the input, which is not equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the sign of the imaginary part of the result if it's non-zero, which is not equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
