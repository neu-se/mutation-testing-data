  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete()` method would delete the entire line, whereas the original code fragment only pushed the current op to the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(Op.length(thisOp))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain()` method would retain the entire line, whereas the original code fragment only pushed the current op to the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push()` method would push the current op to the line, whereas the original code fragment only pushed the current op to the line if it was an insert operation.

DONE.
