  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)) return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` and `currentUrlStr` variables are swapped in the condition. If `baseUrlStr` is not present, the function would return `null`, even if `currentUrlStr` contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)) return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` if the `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters, even if `currentUrlStr` is a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)) return null;
```
This would result in different behavior
