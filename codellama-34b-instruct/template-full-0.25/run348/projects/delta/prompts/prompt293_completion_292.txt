  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the line from the delta, whereas the original code fragment would have pushed the line to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` method would keep the line in the delta, whereas the original code fragment would have pushed the line to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method would insert the line into the delta, whereas the original code fragment would have pushed the line to the delta.

DONE.
