  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, whereas the original code fragment uses the same `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the first `n-1` elements of the original array, whereas the original code fragment uses the last element of the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment does not modify the `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
