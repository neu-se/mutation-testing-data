Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.attributes` is not `null`, but does not verify if it is an object, potentially allowing non-object values to pass through.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `newOp.attributes` is a string instead of an object, which would lead to the wrong condition being satisfied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(newOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `newOp.attributes` is an array, which would be true for array values but false for object values, thus altering the logic of the code.

DONE.
