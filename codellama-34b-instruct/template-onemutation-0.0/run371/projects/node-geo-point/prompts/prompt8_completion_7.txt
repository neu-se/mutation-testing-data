  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of the `Object` prototype, and it needs to be called with the object as its `this` context in order to work correctly. In the original code, `point.hasOwnProperty` is being used as a shorthand for `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')`, but this shorthand is not always safe to use, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if the object has a property called `hasOwnProperty` that is not a function. By using the longer form `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')`, we ensure that the correct method is being called, and we avoid any potential issues with the object's properties.

DONE.
