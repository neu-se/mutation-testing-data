  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would return a bearing that is 180 degrees different from the original bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would return a bearing that is 180 degrees different from the original bearing, but in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.PI - θ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would return a bearing that is 360 degrees different from the original bearing.

DONE.
