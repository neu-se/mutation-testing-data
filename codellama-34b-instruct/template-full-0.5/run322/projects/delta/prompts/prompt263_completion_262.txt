  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different property than `otherOp.attributes`, and it may not have the same value or type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different property than `otherOp.attributes`, and it may not have the same value or type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.insert` is a different property than `otherOp.attributes`, and it may not have the same value or type.

DONE.
