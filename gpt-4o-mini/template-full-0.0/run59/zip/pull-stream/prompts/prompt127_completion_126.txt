Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the current value of `i` instead of incrementing it, which means the function will always return the same value until `i` is manually changed elsewhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the value of `i` incremented by 1, which means the function will always return a value that is one greater than the current value of `i`, leading to incorrect counting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(new Error('Max limit exceeded'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the maximum limit is exceeded instead of simply calling the callback with the current value of `i`, which could disrupt the flow of the program and lead to unhandled exceptions.

DONE.
