 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor['op']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the string 'op' instead of the value of the variable `op`. The code would always look for the property named 'op' in the descriptor object, instead of using the value of the `op` variable as the property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
descriptor[42]
