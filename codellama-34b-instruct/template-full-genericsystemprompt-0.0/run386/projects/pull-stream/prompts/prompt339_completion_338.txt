  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is now being incremented by 1, which could cause the `unique` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is now being decremented by 1, which could cause the `unique` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is now being multiplied by 2, which could cause the `unique` function to return a different result.

DONE.
