  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[^a]e
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is matching any character that is not "a", whereas the original regular expression is matching the character "a" literally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e{2}
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is matching two consecutive "e" characters, whereas the original regular expression is matching a single "e" character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\w{2}e
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is matching two word characters followed by an "e", whereas the original regular expression is matching a single "e" character.

DONE.
