  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if both `z` and `z` are infinite, which is always `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity && z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if the real part of `this` and `z` are both infinite, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']().equals(Infinity) && z['abs']().equals(Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if the absolute value of `this` and `z` are both infinite, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
