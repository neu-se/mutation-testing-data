  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function, instead of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments), 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all the elements of the `arguments` object, and then the first element of that array would be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a new array containing all the elements of the `arguments` object starting from the second element, and then the first element of that array would be passed to the `Q.denodeify` function.

DONE.
