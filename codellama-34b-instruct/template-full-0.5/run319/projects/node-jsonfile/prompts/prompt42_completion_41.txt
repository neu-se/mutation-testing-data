  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "buggy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ "buggy"` part would cause the function to return a string that is not a valid JSON representation of the object, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument would cause the `stringify` function to include the object's prototype in the JSON representation, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` argument would cause the `stringify` function to return a string that is not a valid JSON representation of the object, which would cause the `JSON.parse` call to throw an error.

DONE.
