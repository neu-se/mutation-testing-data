  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator that returns `true` if both operands are truthy. Since `aborted` is a boolean variable, it can only be `true` or `false`. If `aborted` is `true`, the expression `aborted && true` would evaluate to `true`, and if `aborted` is `false`, the expression would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR operator that returns `true` if either operand is truthy. Since `aborted` is
