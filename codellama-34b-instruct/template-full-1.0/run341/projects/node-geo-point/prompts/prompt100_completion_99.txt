  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude value doubled, which would throw off the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude * 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude value tripled, which would throw off the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random value between 0 and 10, which would throw off the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
