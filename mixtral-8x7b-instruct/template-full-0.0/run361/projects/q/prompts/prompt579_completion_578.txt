 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return continuer }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function with a pre-defined `this` value and partially applied arguments. By replacing it with a function that simply returns `continuer`, the new function will not have the same behavior as the original one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and attempting to call it as a function would result in a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a method that tests whether an object has a property with a given name. By replacing `continuer.bind` with `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind`, the new function would have a different behavior and purpose.

DONE.
