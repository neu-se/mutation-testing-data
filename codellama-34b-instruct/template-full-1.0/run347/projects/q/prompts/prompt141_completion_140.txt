  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate through the source of the source, instead of the source itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate through the source of the source of the source, instead of the source itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate through a slice of the source, instead of the source itself.

DONE.
