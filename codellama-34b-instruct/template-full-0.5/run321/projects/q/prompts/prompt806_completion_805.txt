  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which is unlikely to be a valid value for the `finally` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the `finally` method, but it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
