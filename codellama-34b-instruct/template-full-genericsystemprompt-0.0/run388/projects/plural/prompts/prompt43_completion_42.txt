  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always remove one character from the end of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in a consonant or a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always remove three characters from the end of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in a consonant or a vowel.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - w.indexOf('e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting code would always remove the number of characters from the end of the word until it reaches the first occurrence of the letter 'e', regardless of whether the word ends in a consonant or a vowel.

DONE.
