  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment swapped the variables `a` and `b`, while this code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment multiplied `a` and `b`, while this code fragment adds them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment added `a` and `b`, while this code fragment multiplies them.

DONE.
