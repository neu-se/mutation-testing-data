  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with a different argument, which could lead to a different URL being parsed and a different result being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` string is modified before being passed to the `parse` function, which could lead to a different URL being parsed and a different result being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `linkurl` string is modified before being passed to the `parse` function, which could lead to a different URL being parsed and a different result being returned.

DONE.
