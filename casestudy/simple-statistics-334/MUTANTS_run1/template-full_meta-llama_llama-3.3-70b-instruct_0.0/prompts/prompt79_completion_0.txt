Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round down the left index to the nearest integer instead of up, potentially changing the range of elements considered for the quantile calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[l] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the left index one position to the right, potentially excluding the first element of the range from the quantile calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(indices[l] / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reduce the left index by half, potentially reducing the range of elements considered for the quantile calculation and leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
