  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called on the array returned by `split()`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than reversing the order of the characters in each element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
.slice(1).reverse(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called on the array returned by `split()`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than reversing the order of the characters in each element. Additionally, the `<PLACEHOLDER>` would be replaced with a buggy code fragment, which would cause the code to behave differently.
