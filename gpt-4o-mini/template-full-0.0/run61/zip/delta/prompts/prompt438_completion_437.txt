Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the condition to fail for valid numeric retain values, leading to incorrect operation handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is greater than zero, which would incorrectly allow only positive retain values, potentially skipping valid zero or negative retain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `nextOp.retain` is undefined, which would cause the condition to fail for any defined retain values, leading to incorrect operation handling.

DONE.
