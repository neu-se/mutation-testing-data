  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!map` checks if the `map` variable is falsy, while `map === null` checks if the `map` variable is strictly equal to `null`. If the `map` variable is any other falsy value, such as `undefined` or `false`, the original code fragment would still execute the `return id` statement, while the modified code fragment would not.
