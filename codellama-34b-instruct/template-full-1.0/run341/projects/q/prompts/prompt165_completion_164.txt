  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one more time, potentially accessing an out-of-bounds array index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition would already be false on the first iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.length - i
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be checking the length of the array minus the current index, rather than the index itself.

DONE.
