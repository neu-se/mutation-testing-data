 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function would always have the if condition evaluated to true, even if the `rejected` function is not defined, causing the error handling code to always execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the if condition would now check if the `rejected` variable is not equal to null, instead of checking if it is a function. This could cause unexpected behavior if the `rejected` variable is set to a non-function value other than null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the if condition would now check if the `rejected` variable is of type object, instead of checking if it is a function. This could cause unexpected behavior if the `rejected` variable is set to an object, but not a function.

DONE.
