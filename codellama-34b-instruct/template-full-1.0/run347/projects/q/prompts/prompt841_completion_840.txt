  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError(), null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function is called immediately without waiting for the promise to settle, which could result in unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.call(null, error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to set the `this` context of the `onUnhandledError` function to `null`, which could affect its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method is used to create a rejected promise with the given error, which would cause the promise chain to be terminated.

DONE.
