Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `NaN` when both the numerator and denominator are infinite, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the current instance is zero instead of checking if the denominator is infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results when dividing by an infinite complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` when `z` is not infinite, which would incorrectly allow the division to proceed instead of returning `NaN` when both numbers are infinite.

DONE.
