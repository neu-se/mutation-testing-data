  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the parsing of query strings and the normalization of URLs.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com", false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different base URL for parsing the URL.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the URL using the built-in `URL.parse()` method, which might behave differently than the custom implementation provided by the `parse()` function.

DONE.
