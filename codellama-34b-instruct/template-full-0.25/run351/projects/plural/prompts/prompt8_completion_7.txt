  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the function to return the wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a result that is one more than the expected result, causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a result that is twice the expected result, causing the test to fail.

DONE.
