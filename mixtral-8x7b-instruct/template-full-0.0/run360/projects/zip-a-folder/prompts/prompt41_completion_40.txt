 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when splitting the `src` string in the `compress` method, as an empty string cannot be used as a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `glob` method to fail, as it expects a string pattern rather than a directory path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `glob` method to treat the `src` string as a file path rather than a glob pattern, potentially resulting in incorrect file matching and extraction.

DONE.
