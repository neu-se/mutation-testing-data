  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at the next index instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at the previous index instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at twice the current index instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
