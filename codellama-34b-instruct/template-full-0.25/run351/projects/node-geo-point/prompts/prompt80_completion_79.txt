  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the longitude of the destination point using the formula `λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x)`, while this replacement would simply add the longitudes of the two points, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the longitude of the destination point using the formula `λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x)`, while this replacement would subtract the longitudes of the two points, resulting in a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the longitude of the destination point using the formula `λ2 = λ1 + atan2(y, x)`, while this replacement would multiply the longitudes of the two points
