  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(otherOp.attributes, thisOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which could lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which could lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` method to be called with the `reverse` argument set to `true`, which could lead to a different result.

DONE.
