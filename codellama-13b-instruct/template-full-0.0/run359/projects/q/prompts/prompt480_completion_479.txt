  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the element at the specified index from the `unhandledReasons` array, whereas the original code fragment would remove the element at the specified index and insert a new element at that index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array, whereas the original code fragment would remove the element at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element from the `unhandledReasons` array, whereas the original code fragment would remove the element at the specified index.

DONE.
