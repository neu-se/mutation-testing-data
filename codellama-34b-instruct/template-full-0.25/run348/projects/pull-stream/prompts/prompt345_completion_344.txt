  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with `null` instead of `abort` when `abort` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? abort: null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with `abort` instead of `null` when `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? abort: null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with `abort` instead of `null` when `abort` is `false`.

DONE.
