  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an array of arguments, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an array of arguments, and passing an empty array would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an array of arguments, and passing an array with different values would cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
