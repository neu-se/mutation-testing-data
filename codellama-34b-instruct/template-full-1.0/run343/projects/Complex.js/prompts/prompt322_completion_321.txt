  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because a + 10 will produce a different result than 2 * a, which will affect the calculation of the im and re properties of the Complex object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because b * a will produce a different result than 2 * a, which will affect the calculation of the im and re properties of the Complex object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because a - b will produce a different result than 2 * a, which will affect the calculation of the im and re properties of the Complex object.

DONE.
