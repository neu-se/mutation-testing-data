  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return `undefined`, which would cause the `writeFile` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return `null`, which would cause the `writeFile` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return an empty object, which would cause the `writeFile` function to fail.

DONE.
