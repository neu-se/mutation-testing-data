  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters the ops array by retaining only the elements that satisfy the predicate, while the modified code fragment filters the ops array by retaining only the elements that do not satisfy the predicate.
