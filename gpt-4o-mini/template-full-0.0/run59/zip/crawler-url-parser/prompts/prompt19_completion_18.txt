Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the entire `baseUrlStr` to lowercase, which may alter the case sensitivity of the URL and potentially lead to incorrect parsing or resolution of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/http:\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from `http` to `https`, which could lead to incorrect URL resolution if the original URL was intended to be `http`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/\/$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes a trailing slash from `baseUrlStr`, which could affect the resolution of relative URLs that depend on the presence of that trailing slash.

DONE.
