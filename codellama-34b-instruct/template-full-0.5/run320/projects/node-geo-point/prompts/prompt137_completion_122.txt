  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + precision
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a fixed value to the latitude, whereas the original code fragment would round the latitude to the specified precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - precision
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract a fixed value from the longitude, whereas the original code fragment would round the longitude to the specified precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * precision
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the latitude by a fixed value, whereas the original code fragment would round the latitude to the specified precision.

DONE.
