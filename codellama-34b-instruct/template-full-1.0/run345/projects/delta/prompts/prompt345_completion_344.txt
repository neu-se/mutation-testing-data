  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(otherOp.insert, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the invert method is receiving the wrong arguments. The original code was passing the correct arguments, but this mutation would cause an error due to incorrect arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(otherOp.insert, thisOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the invert method is receiving different arguments. The original code was passing the correct arguments, but this mutation would cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const inverted = handler.invert(otherOp.insert, thisOp.insert)
return inverted !== otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the return statement is checking if the inverted result is equal to the input, but this mutation would return the opposite result.

DONE.
