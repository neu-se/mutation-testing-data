  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect(true).state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for any promise, not just pending promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect(false).state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for any fulfilled promise, not just pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect(!this.isRejected()).state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` for any promise that is not rejected, not just pending promises.

DONE.
