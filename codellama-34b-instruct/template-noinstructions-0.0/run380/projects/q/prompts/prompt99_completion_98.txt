  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run one less time, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, potentially causing an infinite loop.

DONE.
