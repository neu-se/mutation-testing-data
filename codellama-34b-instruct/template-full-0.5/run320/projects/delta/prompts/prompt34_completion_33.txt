  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` checks if `a` is null or undefined, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` checks if `a` is strictly equal to null, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== null && typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not null and not an object, while `typeof a !== 'object'` only checks if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
