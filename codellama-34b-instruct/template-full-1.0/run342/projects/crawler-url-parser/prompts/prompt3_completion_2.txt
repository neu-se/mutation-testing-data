  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof currentUrlStr !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `typeof currentUrlStr` is equal to `'undefined'`, while the mutated code fragment checks if it is not equal to `'undefined'`. If the `typeof currentUrlStr` is equal to `'undefined'`, the original code fragment would return `null`, while the mutated code fragment would continue executing the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.length >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `typeof currentUrlStr` is equal to `'undefined'`, while the mutated code fragment checks if the length of `currentUrlStr` is greater than or equal to 1. If the length of `currentUrlStr` is greater than or equal to 1, the original code fragment would continue executing the rest of the code, while the mutated code fragment would return `null`.
