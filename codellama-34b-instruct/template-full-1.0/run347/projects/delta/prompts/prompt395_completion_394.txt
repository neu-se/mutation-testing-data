  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` will always be `undefined` since `thisOp` is an insert operation, and `thisOp.retain` is only defined for retain and delete operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is an insert operation, and `otherOp.delete` is only defined for delete operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `!thisOp.insert` is always `true` for retain and delete operations, but `false` for insert operations.

DONE.
