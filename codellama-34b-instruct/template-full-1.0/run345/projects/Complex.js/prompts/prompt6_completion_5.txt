  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.exp` function is expecting a non-zero value for its argument, but `0` is a valid input for `Math.log`, and it would cause the function to return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a completely different value. The `cosh` function is expecting a value in the range of -π/4 to π/4, so `2` is outside of that range and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value. The `cosh` function is expecting a value in the range of -π/4 to π/4, so `-2` is outside of that range and would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
