  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is a `Delta` instance, while the buggy code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `delta` object, which is a `Delta` instance, but with a typo in the method name, resulting in a `TypeError` being thrown.
