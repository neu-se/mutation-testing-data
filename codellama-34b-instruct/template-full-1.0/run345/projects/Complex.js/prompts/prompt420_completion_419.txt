  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` and `isZero` are different functions that check for different conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] === Infinity` is a different condition than `this['isZero']()`, and would result in a different branch of the if-statement being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] === Infinity` is a different condition than `this['isZero']()`, and would result in a different branch of the if-statement being executed.

DONE.
