  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) will always return 0, regardless of the values of `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK`, whereas the bitwise OR operator (`|`) will return a non-zero value if either of the operands is non-zero.

DONE.
