  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception).then(resolve, resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected twice, once with the original exception and again with a new exception created by `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
().then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be immediately resolved with the value `undefined`, bypassing the `deferred.reject` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new promise object, rather than the original exception.

DONE.
