  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different object, and the `parsedUrl.protocol` property would be set to `null`, causing the function to return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different object, and the `parsedUrl.protocol` property would be set to `undefined`, causing the function to return `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would return a different object, and the `parsedUrl.protocol` property would be set to `null`, causing the function to return `null` instead of the expected object.

DONE.
