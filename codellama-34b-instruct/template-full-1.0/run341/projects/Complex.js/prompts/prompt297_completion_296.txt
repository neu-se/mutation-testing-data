  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.sinh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would have a different imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would have a different real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the complex number would have a different imaginary part.

DONE.
