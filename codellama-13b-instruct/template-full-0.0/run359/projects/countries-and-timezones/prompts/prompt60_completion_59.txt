  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is called with two arguments, while the original code only called it with one argument. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently and introduce a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is called with three arguments, while the original code only called it with two arguments. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently and introduce a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id, { includeTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is called with an additional argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently and introduce a bug.

DONE.
