  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` is the hyperbolic tangent function, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
csch
```
This would result in different behavior because `csch` is the hyperbolic cosecant function, whereas `cosh` is the hyperbolic cosine function.

DONE.
