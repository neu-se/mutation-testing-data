  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `module` is an object, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not an object. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `module` is not an object.

DONE.
