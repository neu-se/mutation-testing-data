  Sure, here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the result up to the next whole number, instead of down to the nearest whole number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the result to the nearest whole number, instead of down to the nearest whole number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(offset / 60.0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the offset by 60.0 instead of 60, resulting in a different result for the hours and minutes.

DONE.
