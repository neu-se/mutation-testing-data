  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to assume that the `options` parameter is always null, even when it is not. This would lead to a null pointer exception if the `options` parameter is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to assume that the `options` parameter is always an empty object, even when it is not. This would lead to unexpected behavior if the `options` parameter is not an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.foo !== 'bar'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to assume that the `options` parameter has a `foo` property that is not equal to `'bar'`, even when it is
