  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `Map` object, instead of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the key-value pairs of the `Map` object, instead of just the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of key-value pairs in the `Map` object, instead of iterating over them.

DONE.
