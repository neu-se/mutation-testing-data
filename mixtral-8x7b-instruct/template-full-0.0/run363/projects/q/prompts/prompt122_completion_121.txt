 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `keys` method to the prototype of all objects, not just enumerable own properties of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `object_keys` to return an empty array for any object, instead of an array of its own enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){ return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `42` instead of the keys of the object.

DONE.
