  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the second element of the array instead of the first, potentially missing the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the previous element of the array instead of the first, potentially iterating over the same element twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the last element of the array instead of the first, potentially iterating over the elements in reverse order.

DONE.
