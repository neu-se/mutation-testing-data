  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `diff` method to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `diff` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `diff` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
