  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This change will cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This change will cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This change will cause the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function to be called with an empty function as the first argument, which may cause the function to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
