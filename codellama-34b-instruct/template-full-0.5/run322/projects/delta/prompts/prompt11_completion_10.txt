  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the key is in the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which could lead to different results if the objects have different keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in a && !(key in b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the key is in the `a` object and not in the `b` object, which could lead to different results if the objects have different keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b && !(key in a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the key is in the `b` object and not in the `a` object, which could lead to different results if the objects have different keys.

DONE.
