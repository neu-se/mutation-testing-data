  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, so the `once` function would be called if `end` is `false`, instead of when it is `true` as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate to `true` if both `end` and `onEnd` are truthy, so the `once` function would only be called if both conditions are met, instead of just `end` as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if either `end` or `onEnd` are truthy, so the `once` function would be called if either condition is met, instead of just `end` as intended.

DONE.
