Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the argument passed to the callback from the error object (or message) to a boolean `false`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the error case in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('An error occurred'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly creates and passes an Error object to the callback, which may change how the error is handled compared to passing the original `end` value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a string 'error' as the second argument to the callback instead of the expected value, which could lead to confusion or incorrect processing in the callback function.

DONE.
