Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip adding the new operation to the `ops` array, effectively ignoring the `retain` operation and not modifying the state of the `Delta` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, regardless of the logic that checks for merging with the last operation, potentially leading to incorrect operation sequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the correct position, which could disrupt the intended order of operations and lead to incorrect processing of the operations.

DONE.
