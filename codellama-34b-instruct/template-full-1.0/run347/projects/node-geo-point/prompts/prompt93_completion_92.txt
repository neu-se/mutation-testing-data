  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `θ` represents the bearing between two points, and `θ + 180` represents the bearing in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * θ
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `θ` represents the bearing between two points, and `2 * θ` represents the bearing between two points that are twice as far apart.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `θ` represents the bearing between two points, and `θ - 90` represents the bearing between two points that are 90 degrees away from each other.

DONE.
