  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `path` string to lowercase, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `path` string into an array of substrings using `/` as the separator, and then return the first element of the array. This could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy requires a specific format for the `path` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the number of characters in the `path` string, which could cause the `query()` method to return incorrect results if the policy requires a specific length for the `path` parameter.
