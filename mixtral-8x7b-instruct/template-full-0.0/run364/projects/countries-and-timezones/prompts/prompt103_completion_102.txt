 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, prev)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of mutating the existing one, which might cause inconsistencies in the data used by other parts of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object when `prev` is falsy, which might cause issues if other parts of the code expect a non-empty object or specific properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't copy the `prev` object, so any modifications to `prev` after this line would also affect the returned object, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
