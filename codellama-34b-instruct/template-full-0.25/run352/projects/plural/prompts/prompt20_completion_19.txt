  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the word with an additional "s" at the end, regardless of whether the word already ends in "s" or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the word with an additional "es" at the end, regardless of whether the word already ends in "s" or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
