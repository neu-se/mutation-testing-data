  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index - end` expression would produce a negative number, which would cause the `while` loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index + end` expression would produce a large number, which would cause the `while` loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index + 1` expression would produce a different number than `end - index`, which would cause the `while` loop to run a different number of times.

DONE.
