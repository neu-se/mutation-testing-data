  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` pops from the front of the array, while `pop` pops from the back.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new copy of the array, while `pop` mutates the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops = this.ops.filter((_, i) => i < this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new copy of the array, while `pop` mutates the original array.

DONE.
