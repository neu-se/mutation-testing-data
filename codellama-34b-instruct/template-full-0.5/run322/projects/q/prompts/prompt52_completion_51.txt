  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a callback function to call `flush` after a task is completed, while this modified code fragment uses an empty function, which would not call `flush` and therefore not execute the task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick(function() { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a callback function to call `flush` after a task is completed, while this modified code fragment uses a callback function that throws an error, which would not call `flush` and therefore not execute the task.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick(function() { setTimeout(flush, 0); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a callback function to call `flush` after a task is completed, while this modified code fragment uses a callback function that schedules `flush` to be
