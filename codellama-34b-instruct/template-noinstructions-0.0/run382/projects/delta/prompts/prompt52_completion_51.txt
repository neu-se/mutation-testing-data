  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as `a` is not an object and does not have a `keys` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as `b` is not an object and does not have a `keys` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error, as `c` is not an object and does not have a `keys` method.

DONE.
