  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to return `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to return `undefined` instead of a rejected promise, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses this method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thenReject` method to return a rejected promise instead of the original promise, which could lead to unexpected results in the code that uses this method.

DONE.
