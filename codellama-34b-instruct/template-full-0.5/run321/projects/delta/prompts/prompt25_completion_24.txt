  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] > b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the original code fragment checks for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator performs addition, whereas the original code fragment checks for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the original code fragment checks for equality using the `==` operator.

DONE.
