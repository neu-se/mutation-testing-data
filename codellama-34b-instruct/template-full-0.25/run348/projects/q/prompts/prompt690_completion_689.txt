  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to include all arguments, while the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)` to exclude the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to include all arguments, while the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)` to include only the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments)` to include all arguments, while the new code fragment uses `array_slice(arguments, 2)` to
