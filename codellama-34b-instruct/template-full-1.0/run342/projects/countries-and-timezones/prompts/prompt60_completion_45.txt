  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.min()` returns the smallest number in the list, whereas `buildCountry()` is expected to return a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.timezones[id]` may not exist, and `buildCountry()` is expected to return a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildTimezone()` returns a timezone object, whereas `buildCountry()` is expected to return a country object.

DONE.
