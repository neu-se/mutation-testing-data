  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` refers to a different array than `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `Q.nextTick.runAfter` would not be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would throw an exception when trying to access the `length` property of `null`.

DONE.
