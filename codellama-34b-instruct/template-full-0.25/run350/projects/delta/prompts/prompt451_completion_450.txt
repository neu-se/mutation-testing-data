  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, while the `!this.hasNext()` method returns the opposite boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property is used to keep track of the current position in the iterator, while the `ops.length` property is used to get the length of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset < Op.length(this.ops[this.index])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` property is used to keep track of the current position in the current operation, while the `Op.length()` method is used to get the length of the current operation.

DONE.
