  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(1)` would return a new array with the element `1` appended to the end, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.pop()` would remove and return the last element of the array, whereas `array_slice` would return a shallow copy of the array.

DONE.
