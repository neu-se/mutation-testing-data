 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is passed to the callback immediately, instead of waiting for the next iteration of the map function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is explicitly set to null, discarding any error that occurred in the map function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the data is passed to the callback instead of the error, even if an error occurred in the map function.

DONE.
