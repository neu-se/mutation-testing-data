  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn(name + " is deprecated, use " + alternative + " instead.", new Error("").stack);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would no longer contain a stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn(name + " is deprecated, use " + alternative + " instead.", new Error("").stackTrace);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object does not have a `stackTrace` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn(name + " is deprecated, use " + alternative + " instead.", new Error("").stack.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object does not have a `slice` method.

DONE.
