  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This is the correct replacement for the `Math.atan2` function, which calculates the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b / a)
```
This is an alternative way to calculate the arctangent of the ratio of `b` and `a`, but it may not be as accurate as `Math.atan2` for certain values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b) / Math.atan(a)
```
This is a different way to calculate the arctangent of the ratio of `b` and `a`, but it may not be as accurate as `Math.atan2` for certain values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
