  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is not a function and would throw an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array and would be passed as a single argument to the function, rather than being spread as individual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would throw an error when called.

DONE.
