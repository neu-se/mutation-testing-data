  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` will immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` will wait for any buffered data to be flushed before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end(null)` will immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` will wait for any buffered data to be flushed before closing the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `end('')` will immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` will wait for any buffered data to be flushed before closing the stream.

DONE.
