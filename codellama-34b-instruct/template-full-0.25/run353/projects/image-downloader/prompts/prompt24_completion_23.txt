  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while the new code fragment `options.dest.split('/').pop()` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/[^\/]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while the new code fragment `options.dest.replace(/[^\/]+$/, '')` is a string with the last segment removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while the new code fragment `options.dest.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/')` is a string with the last segment removed.
