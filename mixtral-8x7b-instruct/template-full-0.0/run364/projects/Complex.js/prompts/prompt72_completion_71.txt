 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method would not be called on `a` if `tokens` is `undefined`, and the loop that processes the tokens would not execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop that processes the tokens would not execute if `tokens` has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof tokens === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method would not be called on `a` if `tokens` is `undefined`, and the loop that processes the tokens would not execute.

DONE.
