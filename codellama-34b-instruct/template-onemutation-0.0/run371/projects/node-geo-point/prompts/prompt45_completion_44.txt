  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r < 1 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the greater-than operator, while the mutated code fragment uses the less-than operator. This would cause the function to return a different value when the input is outside the range of -1 to 1.

DONE.
