  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.push` is a different method than `ref.unshift`, and it would not have the same effect on the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` would return a new array that has the same elements as `ref`, but with the first element removed. This would have a different effect on the code than `ref.unshift`, which would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop` is a different method than `ref.unshift`, and it would not have the same effect on the array.

DONE.
