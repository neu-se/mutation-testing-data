  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ops` property is an array, but replacing it with `null` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ops` property is an array, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ops` property is an array, but replacing it with an empty array would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
