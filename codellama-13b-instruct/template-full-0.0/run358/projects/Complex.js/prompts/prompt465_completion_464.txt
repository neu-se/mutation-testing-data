  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

DONE.
