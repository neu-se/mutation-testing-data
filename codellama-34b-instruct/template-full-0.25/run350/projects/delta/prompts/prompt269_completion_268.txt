  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one character from the delta, which would cause the resulting delta to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(1, { bold: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a bold attribute to the first character of the delta, which would cause the resulting delta to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert('X')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the character 'X' into the delta, which would cause the resulting delta to be different from the original.

DONE.
