 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[data, end]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to the callback function is changed, which might cause issues if the tests or the code that uses this module relies on the specific order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `null` value is being passed to the callback function, which might cause issues if the tests or the code that uses this module does not expect an additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an unexpected value (`1`) is being passed to the callback function, which might cause issues if the tests or the code that uses this module relies on the specific value of the arguments.

By introducing these changes, we can test the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior caused by changes in the order, number, or value
