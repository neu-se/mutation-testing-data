  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() - 1
```
This change will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` when the `peekLength()` method returns a value greater than or equal to 1, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() + 1
```
This change will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` when the `peekLength()` method returns a value greater than or equal to 1, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength() * 2
```
This change will cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` when the `peekLength()` method returns a value greater than or equal to 2, which is not the intended behavior of the method.

DONE.
