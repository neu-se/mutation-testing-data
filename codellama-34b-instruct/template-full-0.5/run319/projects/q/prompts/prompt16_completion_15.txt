  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" && typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the code inside the `if` statement run when `window` and `self` are undefined, rather than when they are defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require both `window` and `self` to be defined, rather than just one of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof self !== "undefined" && typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require all three variables to be defined, rather than just two of them.

DONE.
