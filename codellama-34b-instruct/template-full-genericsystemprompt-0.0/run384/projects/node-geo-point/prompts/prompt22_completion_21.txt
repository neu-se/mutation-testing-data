  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method of `Object.prototype`, and using `call` or `apply` to invoke it would change the value of `this` inside the method, potentially causing it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.bind(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context and arguments, which can affect the behavior of `hasOwnProperty` when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `hasOwnProperty` directly on the `Object.prototype` object, rather than on the `object` itself. This could potentially cause
