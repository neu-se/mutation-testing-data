 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to an abstract equality comparison, which may not behave the same way as the original strict equality comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'!=='
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the equality comparison to an abstract inequality comparison, which may not behave the same way as the original strict equality comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'>'
