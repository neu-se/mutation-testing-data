  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.replaceAll` would replace all occurrences of the search value, whereas `str.replace` would only replace the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace('\\n', EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.replace('\\n', EOL)` would only replace the first occurrence of the search value, whereas `str.replace(/\n/g, EOL)` would replace all occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/\r\n/g, EOL)
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.replace(/\r\n/g, EOL)` would replace all occurrences of the search value, whereas `str.replace(/\n/g, EOL)` would only replace the first occurrence.

DONE.
