  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates the `acc` variable with the value of `data`, while this new code fragment updates `acc` with the value of `data + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates the `acc` variable with the value of `data`, while this new code fragment updates `acc` with the value of `data * 2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment updates the `acc` variable with the value of `data`, while this new code fragment updates `acc` with the value of `data - 1`.

DONE.
