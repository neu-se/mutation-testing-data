  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called with the new op, and the op would not be added to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called with the new op, and the op would not be added to the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called with the new op, and the op would not be added to the `ops` array.

DONE.
