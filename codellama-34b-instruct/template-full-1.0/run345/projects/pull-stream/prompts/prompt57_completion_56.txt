  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the `item` onto the array, but the modified code pushes `item * 2` onto the array, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the `item` onto the array, but the modified code pushes `item + 1` onto the array, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the `item` onto the array, but the modified code pushes `item || null` onto the array, which is a different value.

DONE.
