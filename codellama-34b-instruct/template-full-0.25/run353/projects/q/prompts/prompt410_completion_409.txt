  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses to call the `inspect` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `call` method to bind the `inspect` method to the `value` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `apply` method to bind the `inspect` method to the `value` object.

DONE.
