  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the parsed URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the formatted URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
