 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` resolves when all input promises are fulfilled, while `Q.allResolved` waits for all promises to be settled, regardless of their fulfillment or rejection status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.all
