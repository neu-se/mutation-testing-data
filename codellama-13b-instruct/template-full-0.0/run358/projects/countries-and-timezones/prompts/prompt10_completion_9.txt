  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the `Object.assign` method to be called even if the `result[country]` object already exists. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `Object.assign` method is not idempotent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!result[country] && Object.assign(result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is added, which would cause the `Object.assign` method to be called only if the `result[country]` object does not already exist. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `Object.assign` method is not idempotent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] || Object.assign(result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } })
```
This would result in different
