  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass an extra argument to `dispatch()`, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the same value for both the `name` and `args` parameters, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args].concat([0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append an extra value to the `args` array, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
