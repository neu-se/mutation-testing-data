  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/o/, 'u') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match and replace "wo" with "wu" instead of "wo" with "we".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^man$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match and replace "man" with "mans" instead of "man" with "men".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^wo?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/n/, 'd') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match and replace "man" with "mad" instead of "man" with "men".

DONE.
