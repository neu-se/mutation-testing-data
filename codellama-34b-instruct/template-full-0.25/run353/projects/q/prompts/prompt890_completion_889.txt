  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfcall(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nbind(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nbind` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
