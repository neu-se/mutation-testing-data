  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `test` function, potentially causing the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && test
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `cb` function if both `cb` and `test` are truthy, which could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && !cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `cb` function if `test` is truthy and `cb` is falsy, which could cause the `cb` function to be called with a different set of arguments or not at all.

DONE.
