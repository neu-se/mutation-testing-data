  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `path` variable directly, while the new code fragment is using the last segment of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[^\/]+/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `path` variable directly, while the new code fragment is using a regular expression to remove all non-slash characters from the path.

DONE.
