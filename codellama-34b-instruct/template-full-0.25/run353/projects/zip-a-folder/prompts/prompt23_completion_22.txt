  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create('zip')
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create('zip')` creates a new archive, whereas `archiver` is an existing archive that has already been created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create('tar')
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create('tar')` creates a new archive with a different format than the original code, which is `archiver.create('zip')`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.create('zip', { store: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.create('zip', { store: true })` creates a new archive with a different compression level than the original code, which is `archiver.create('zip')`.

DONE.
