  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve()` would be called with the rejected value, whereas the original code would call `reject()` with the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (exception) { 
  reject(exception); 
 } else { 
  resolve(value); 
 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `reject()` if there is an exception and would otherwise call `resolve()`, whereas the original code would always call `reject()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof value === "object") { 
  reject(new Error("Cannot resolve object")); 
 } else { 
  resolve(value); 
 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call `reject()` if the value is an object and would otherwise call `resolve()`, whereas the original code would always call `reject()`.

DONE.
