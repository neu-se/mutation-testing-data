  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && function () {}
```
This change will cause the `sink.abort` function to always return a function, even if `cb` is not provided. This could potentially cause issues if the function is expected to return a value other than a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function (err) { throw err; }
```
This change will cause the `sink.abort` function to throw an error if `cb` is not provided. This could potentially cause issues if the function is expected to return a value other than a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb || function (err) { console.error(err); }
```
This change will cause the `sink.abort` function to log an error to the console if `cb` is not provided. This could potentially cause issues if the function is expected to return a value other than a function.

DONE.
