 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object using the `[].slice` method, while the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object using the `Array.prototype.slice` method, while the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.apply.call([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object using the `Function.prototype.apply` method and passing an empty array as the context, while the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have different behavior.

DONE
