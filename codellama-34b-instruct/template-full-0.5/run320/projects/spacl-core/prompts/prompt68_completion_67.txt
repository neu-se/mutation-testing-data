  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first rule in the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the rules in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter(r => r.query(path, verb, ctx) === true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider rules that explicitly allow the action.

DONE.
