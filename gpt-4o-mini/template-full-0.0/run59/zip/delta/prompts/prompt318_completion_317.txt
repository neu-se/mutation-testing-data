Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string' && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is a string and if `op.attributes` is not null, which would cause the logic to skip over certain operations that should be retained, leading to incorrect inversion behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.retain` is strictly undefined, which would bypass the condition for retaining operations that have a numeric value for `op.retain`, potentially causing loss of data during the inversion process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' && op.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `op.attributes` is strictly not undefined, which would allow operations with undefined attributes to be incorrectly processed, potentially leading to unexpected results in the inverted delta.

DONE.
