  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance to the next operation, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next operation without advancing the iterator, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

DONE.
