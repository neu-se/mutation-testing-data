  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.log` function returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to raise a number to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Math.log` function to return the natural logarithm of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to raise a number to a power.

DONE.
