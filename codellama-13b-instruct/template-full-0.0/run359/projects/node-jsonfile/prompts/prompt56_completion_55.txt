  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) from the beginning of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) with a space character, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace(/^\uFEFF/, '\\uFEFF')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the Unicode byte order mark (BOM) with the Unicode byte order mark character itself, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
