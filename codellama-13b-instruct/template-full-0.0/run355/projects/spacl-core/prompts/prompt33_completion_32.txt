  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the string `'foo'` instead of the array of path segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the number `1` instead of the array of path segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over `undefined` instead of the array of path segments.

DONE.
