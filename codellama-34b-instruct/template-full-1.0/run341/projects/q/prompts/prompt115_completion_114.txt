  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the array instead of the current one, which could cause the `map` function to skip over elements or potentially throw an error if the current element is the first one in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the element before the current one, which could cause the `map` function to skip over elements or potentially throw an error if the current element is the first or second one in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] = value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value to the current element in the array instead of returning it, which could cause the `map` function to not work correctly if the intention is to modify the array.

DONE.
