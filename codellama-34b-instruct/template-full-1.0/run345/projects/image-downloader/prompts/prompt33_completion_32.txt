  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(console.log('Resume called'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include any logging or side effects, while this replacement includes a call to `console.log` which would print a message to the console whenever the `resume` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (res.statusCode === 404) {
  res.resume();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include any conditional logic for handling specific status codes, while this replacement includes a check for the `404` status code and calls `resume` only in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume(res.json());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include any JSON parsing or processing, while this replacement includes a call to `res.json()` which would parse the response body as JSON and pass
