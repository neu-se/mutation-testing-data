  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str + '}'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the JSON string to be malformed, leading to a parse error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the writeFile function to return null instead of the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the writeFile function to return 0 instead of the expected result.

DONE.
