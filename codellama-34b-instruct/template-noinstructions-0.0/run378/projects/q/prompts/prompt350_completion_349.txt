  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `self` is an object that contains the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch()` is a function that returns a promise, whereas `self` is an object that contains the `promiseDispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)` is a function that returns a bound version of the `promiseDispatch` method, whereas `self` is an object that contains the `promiseDispatch` method.

DONE.
