  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the value of options.dest, which would change the destination path of the file being downloaded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value of options.dest to uppercase, which could change the case of the destination path of the file being downloaded.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the path segments in options.dest, which could change the destination path of the file being downloaded.

DONE.
