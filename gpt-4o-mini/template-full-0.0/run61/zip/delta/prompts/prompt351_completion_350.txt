Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes from `baseOp`, potentially leading to incorrect attribute inversion or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object instead of the actual attributes would result in the `AttributeMap.invert` function not having the necessary data to perform a proper inversion, which could lead to loss of attribute information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because using `baseOp.insert` instead of `baseOp.attributes` would pass the insert data to the `AttributeMap.invert` function, which is not intended and could lead to incorrect handling of attributes during the inversion process.

DONE.
