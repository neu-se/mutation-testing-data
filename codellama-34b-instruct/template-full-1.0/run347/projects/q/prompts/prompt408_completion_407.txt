  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a constructor, and replacing it with a function expression would cause the code to fail to construct an instance of `Promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a function, and replacing it with the number `1` would cause the code to fail to call the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` is a function, and replacing it with a string would cause the code to fail to call the function.

DONE.
