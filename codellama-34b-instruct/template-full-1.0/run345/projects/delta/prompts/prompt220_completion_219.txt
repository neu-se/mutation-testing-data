  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op['insert'] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `invert` method to delete insertions and retain deletions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op['delete'] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the op is a deletion, instead of an insertion or a retention with an integer value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op['retain'] === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the op is a retention with a numeric value, instead of an insertion or a deletion.

DONE.
