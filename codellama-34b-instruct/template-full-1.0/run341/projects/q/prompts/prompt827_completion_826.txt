  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `onUnhandledError` function to never be called, even if there is an unhandled error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `onUnhandledError` function to be called every time there is an unhandled error, even if the error is caught and handled by the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` method would be called every time there is an unhandled error, even if the error is caught and handled by the `then` method.

DONE.
