  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes a string with the rest of the part, while this replacement pushes a substring starting from the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.substr(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes a string with the rest of the part, while this replacement pushes a substring starting from the second character and ending at the end of the part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes a string with the rest of the part, while this replacement pushes a string with the characters of the part in reverse order.

DONE.
