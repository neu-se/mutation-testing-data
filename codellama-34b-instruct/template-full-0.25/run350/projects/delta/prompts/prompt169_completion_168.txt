  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to move forward, potentially skipping over important operations in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` iterator to move forward by `length` operations, potentially skipping over important operations in the `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to move forward by `length` operations, potentially skipping over important operations in the `other` delta.

DONE.
