  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetBasePath.slice(1)` would return a new string that is a substring of `targetBasePath`, starting from the second character. This could potentially cause the `access` method to fail, as it may be trying to access a file or directory that does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetBasePath.toUpperCase()` would return a new string that is the uppercase version of `targetBasePath`. This could potentially cause the `access` method to fail, as it may be trying to access a file or directory that does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/').reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because `targetBasePath.split('/').reverse().join('/')` would return a new string that is the
