Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect` method as a function, which may lead to a runtime error if `inspect` is not defined as a callable method on the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `state` property directly on the `inspect` method instead of calling it, which would result in `undefined` if `inspect` is a function, leading to incorrect evaluation of the promise state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `reason` property of the result of the `inspect` method, which may not exist if the promise is not rejected, leading to potential errors or incorrect state evaluations.

DONE.
