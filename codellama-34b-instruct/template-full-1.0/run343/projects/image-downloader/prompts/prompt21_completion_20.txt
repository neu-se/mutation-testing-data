  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is not defined in the function signature and would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid path and would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call `path.isAbsolute(null)`

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is not an absolute path and would evaluate to `false` when passed to `path.isAbsolute()`.

DONE.
