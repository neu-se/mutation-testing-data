  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is both zero and infinite.

DONE.
