  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the input, whereas `JSON.parse` parses a string representation of JSON and returns the corresponding object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a constructor function that returns a number object, whereas `JSON.parse` returns a string representation of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a constructor function that returns a string object, whereas `JSON.parse` returns a string representation of the input.

DONE.
