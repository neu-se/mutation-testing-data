  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor()` function would cause the result to always be rounded down to the nearest integer, whereas the original code would preserve the decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil()` function would cause the result to always be rounded up to the nearest integer, whereas the original code would preserve the decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round()` function would cause the result to be rounded to the nearest integer, whereas the original code would preserve the decimal places.

DONE.
