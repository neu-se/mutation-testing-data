 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'').concat(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it unconditionally prepends an empty string to `currentUrlStr`, which may not be desired.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http:') || currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator (`||`) to return `currentUrlStr` if the replacement operation returns a falsy value (e.g., an empty string).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http:').replace(/^https?:/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the scheme (`http://` or `https://`) from the beginning of `currentUrlStr` if it's present, which may not be desired.

DONE.
