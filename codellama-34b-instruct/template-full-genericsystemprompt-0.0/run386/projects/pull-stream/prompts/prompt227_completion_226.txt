  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `filter` function to return `false` if `test` is truthy, regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `filter` function to return `true` if `test` is falsy, regardless of the value of `data`.

DONE.
