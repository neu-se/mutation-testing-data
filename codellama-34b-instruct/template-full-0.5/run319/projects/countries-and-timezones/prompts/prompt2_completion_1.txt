  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap = data.timezones[id] || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new value to `tzMap` based on the `data.timezones` object, rather than using the `buildTimezonesMap` function to construct the `tzMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap = data.timezones[id] || { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new value to `tzMap` based on the `data.timezones` object, but would also include an empty `current` and `all` array in the new object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzMap = data.timezones[id] || { current: data.timezones[id].current, all: data.timezones[id].all };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new
