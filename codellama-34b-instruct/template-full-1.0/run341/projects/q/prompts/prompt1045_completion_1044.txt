  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get("head")` would return `end.head` instead of `end.tail`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"end"
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get("end")` would return `undefined` instead of `end.tail`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise.get("next")` would return `undefined` instead of `end.tail`.

DONE.
