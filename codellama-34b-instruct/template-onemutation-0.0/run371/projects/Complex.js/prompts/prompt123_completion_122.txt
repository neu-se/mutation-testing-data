  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. In this case, the code is checking if the divisor is infinite, so using `isNaN` instead would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
