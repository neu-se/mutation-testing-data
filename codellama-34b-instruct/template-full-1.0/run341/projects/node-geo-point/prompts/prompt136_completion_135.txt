  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds the number down to the nearest integer, while `precision` is expected to be a floating-point number. Using `Math.floor()` would potentially cause the latitude and longitude to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round()` rounds the number to the nearest integer, while `precision` is expected to be a floating-point number. Using `Math.round()` would potentially cause the latitude and longitude to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds the number up to the nearest integer, while `precision` is expected to be a floating-point number. Using `Math.ceil()` would potentially cause the latitude and longitude to be
