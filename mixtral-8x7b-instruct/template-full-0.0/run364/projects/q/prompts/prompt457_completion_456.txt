 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` method would not be able to find the `promise` in the empty array, and the unhandled rejection would not be reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{push: function() {}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would not grow when tracking rejections, and the `array_indexOf` method would always return -1, preventing the unhandled rejection from being reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a global variable instead of the local one, and the `array_indexOf` method would always return -1, preventing the unhandled rejection from being reported.

DONE.
