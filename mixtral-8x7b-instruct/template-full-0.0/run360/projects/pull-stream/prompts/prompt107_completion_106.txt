 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would not receive the `done` callback as its second argument, and might not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, () => done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would receive an anonymous function as its second argument, which would immediately call `done()` when executed, rather than waiting for the `drain` function to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would receive `undefined` as its second argument, which might not behave as expected.

DONE.
