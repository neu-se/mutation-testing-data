  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the value of the promise to the `thenResolve` method, while the new code fragment `null` would pass `null` to the method, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the value of the promise to the `thenResolve` method, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass `undefined` to the method, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` would pass the value of the promise to the `thenResolve` method, while the new code fragment `0` would pass `0` to the method, which may cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
