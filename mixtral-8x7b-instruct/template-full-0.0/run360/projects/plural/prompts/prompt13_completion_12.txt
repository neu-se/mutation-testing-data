 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.slice(0, -1), 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `concat()` instead of `substr()` to build the resulting string, and `slice()` instead of `substr()` to extract the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.slice(0, -1) + 'y'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `slice()` instead of `substr()` to extract the substring, and it appends 'y' instead of 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `concat()` instead of `substr()` to build the resulting string.

DONE.
