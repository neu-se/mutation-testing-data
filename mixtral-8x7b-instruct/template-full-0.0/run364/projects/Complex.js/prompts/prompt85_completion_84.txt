 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'j'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat 'j' as a string literal instead of a variable representing the imaginary unit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1j
```
This would result in different behavior because it would represent the imaginary unit using a complex number instead of the variable 'j'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] || '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value '1' as the default value for the imaginary part of the complex number even if the input string does not contain an imaginary part.

DONE.
