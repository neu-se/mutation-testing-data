  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, and the function would return "external" for links that are actually internal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host && linkurl.subdomain != pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "subdomain" for links that are actually on the same subdomain, but with a different subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host == pageurl.host && linkurl.subdomain == pageurl.subdomain && linkurl.path != pageurl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return "samelevel" for links that are actually on the same level, but with a different path.

DONE.
