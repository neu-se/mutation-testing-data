  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to the `Math.sin()` function, which would affect the result of the `Complex` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to the `Math.cos()` function, which would affect the result of the `Complex` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the argument passed to the `Math.sin()` function, which would affect the result of the `Complex` constructor.

DONE.
