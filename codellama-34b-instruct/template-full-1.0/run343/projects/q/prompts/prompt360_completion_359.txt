  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which would negate the boolean value of `done`. If `done` was previously set to `true`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`, and the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, and `done` is already a boolean value. This would create a redundant condition that would always evaluate to `false`, and the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator is an assignment operator, which would set the value of `done` to `false`. The code inside the `if` statement would not be executed, but the value of `done` would now be `false`.
