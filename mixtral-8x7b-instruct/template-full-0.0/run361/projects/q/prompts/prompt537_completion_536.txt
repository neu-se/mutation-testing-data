 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would not pass the `value` to the `fulfilled` callback as an array, but instead pass `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would pass an empty array to the `fulfilled` callback, even if the `value` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{then: function() {}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would treat the `value` as a promise and wait for its resolution, even if it is not a promise.

DONE.
