  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start from the last rule in the `rules` array, instead of starting from the first rule. This may cause the loop to skip over some rules, depending on the specific rules that are defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length
```
This change will cause the loop to start from the last rule in the `rules` array, and then iterate backwards through the array. This may cause the loop to skip over some rules, depending on the specific rules that are defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length + 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start from the last rule in the `rules` array, and then iterate backwards through the array, skipping over the first rule. This may cause the loop to skip over some rules, depending on the specific rules that are defined.

DONE.
