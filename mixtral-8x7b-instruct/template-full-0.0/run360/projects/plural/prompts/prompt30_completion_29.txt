 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thes|cris/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly match words like "thespian" and "crisp" due to missing the last characters of the original regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/thesis|crisis|analysis/i
