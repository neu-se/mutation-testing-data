  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty or if the write stream is waiting for a drain, while this new code fragment checks if the queue is not empty and if the write stream is not waiting for a drain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0 || this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty or if the write stream is waiting for a drain, while this new code fragment checks if the queue has at least one element or if the write stream is waiting for a drain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0 && !this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the queue is empty or if the write stream is waiting for a drain,
