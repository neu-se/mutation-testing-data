  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which could cause the algorithm to skip over a necessary operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which could cause the algorithm to include an unnecessary operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the next operation in the other iterator, which could cause the algorithm to include twice as many operations as necessary.

DONE.
