  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being passed to the original `writeFileSync` method, which could lead to incorrect encoding of the written data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, 'utf16')
```
This would result in different behavior because the encoding option is explicitly set to `'utf16'`, which could lead to incorrect encoding of the written data if the original method is expecting a different encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options.encoding ? options.encoding : 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because the encoding option is only set if it is defined in the `options` object, which could lead to incorrect encoding of the written data if the encoding is not specified.

DONE.
