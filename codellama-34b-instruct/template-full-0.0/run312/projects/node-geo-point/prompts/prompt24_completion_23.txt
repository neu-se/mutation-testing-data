  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has the specified property as its own property. By using `call`, we are binding the function to the `object` context, which means that the function will check if the `object` has the property `'longitude'` as its own property, rather than checking if the property exists in the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has the specified property as its own property. By using `hasOwnProperty`, we are checking if the `object` has the property `'longitude'` as its own property, rather than checking if the property exists in the prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
