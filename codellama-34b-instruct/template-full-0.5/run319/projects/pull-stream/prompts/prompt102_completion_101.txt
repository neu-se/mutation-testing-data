  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different function than `console.log`, and it would cause the `log` function to output error messages instead of regular log messages.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log.bind(console)
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log.bind(console)` is a bound function that logs messages to the console, but it would also bind the `this` context to the `console` object, which could cause issues if the function is called with a different `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log.bind(null)` is a bound function that logs messages to the console, but it would also bind the `this` context to `null`, which could cause issues if the function is called with a different `this` context.
