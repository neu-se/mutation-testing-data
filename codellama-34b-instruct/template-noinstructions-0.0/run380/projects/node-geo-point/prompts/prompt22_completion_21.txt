  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has a property with the given name. However, `object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')` will return `true` if the object has a property with the name `'latitude'`, regardless of whether it is an own property or an inherited property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has a property with the given name, and it is the same function that is used by the `hasOwnProperty` method. However, `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')` will return `true` if the object has a property with the name `'latitude'`, regardless
