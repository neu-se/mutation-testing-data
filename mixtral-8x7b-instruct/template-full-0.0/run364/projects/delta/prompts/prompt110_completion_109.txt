 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the absence of `op` as an empty object, potentially causing unexpected results in the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always refer to the first operation in the `ops` array, regardless of the current index, potentially causing incorrect filtering or iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ ...op, insert: op.insert || '' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `insert` property with an empty string if it's not defined, potentially causing issues in the length calculation or other operations that rely on the `insert` property.

DONE.
