  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with buggy code fragments that have different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the new op at the beginning of the `this.ops` array, rather than at the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never insert the new op at the end of the `this.ops` array, causing the `push` method to fail to add any new ops when `this.ops.length` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only insert the new op if `index` is even, causing the `push` method to only add new ops in even-numbered indices.

DONE.
