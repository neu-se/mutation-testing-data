  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite(a)` would return `false` for `NaN` and `Infinity`, causing the function to exit early without checking for other invalid inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid input for the function, but `a === null` would not allow it to be parsed correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would only parse strings, skipping over other valid input types like numbers and arrays.

DONE.
