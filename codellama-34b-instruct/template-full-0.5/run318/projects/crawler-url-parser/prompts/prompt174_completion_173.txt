  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comment and the new code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comment and the new code fragment is a string literal with a concatenated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"for testing purpose" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a comment and the new code fragment is a string literal with a concatenated value that is not a string.

DONE.
