  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the attributes of `thisOp` and `otherOp`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the attributes of `thisOp` and the `retain` property of `otherOp`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.attributes, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to compare the attributes of `thisOp` and the `delete` property of `otherOp`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
