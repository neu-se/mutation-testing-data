  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(Math.random())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a random number, which would cause the iterator to return a random set of operations, rather than the next operation in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with the `retain` property of the current operation, which would cause the iterator to return the next operation in the sequence, but with a different `retain` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with the `retain` property of a different operation, which would cause the iterator to return a different set of operations.

DONE.
