Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'-' + sw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefix the switch with a single hyphen, regardless of whether the character is a letter or a digit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'--' + sw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefix the switch with two hyphens, regardless of whether the character is a letter or a digit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
sw.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the switch to uppercase, potentially changing its meaning or behavior in certain contexts.

DONE.
