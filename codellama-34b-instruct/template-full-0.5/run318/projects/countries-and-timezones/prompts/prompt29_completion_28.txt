  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the remainder of dividing `offset` by 60, rather than the quotient, which is what the original code fragment returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of `offset` and 60, rather than the quotient, which is what the original code fragment returns.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the difference between `offset` and 60, rather than the quotient, which is what the original code fragment returns.

DONE.
