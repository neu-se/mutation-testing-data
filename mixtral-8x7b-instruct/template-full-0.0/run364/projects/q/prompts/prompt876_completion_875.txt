 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the actual implementation of `array_slice`, but using the array literal every time could lead to unnecessary object creation, slightly affecting performance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.slice
