  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating an empty string to `path` will cause the `matches` method to return `true` for any input query, regardless of whether the policy matches the path or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path * ''
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `path` by an empty string will cause the `matches` method to return `null` for any input query, regardless of whether the policy matches the path or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path - ''
```
This would result in different behavior because subtracting an empty string from `path` will cause the `matches` method to return `true` for any input query, regardless of whether the policy matches the path or not.

DONE.
