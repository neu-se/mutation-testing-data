  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.on('end', done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `drain` function, while this code fragment calls the `drain.on` method with the `'end'` event and the `done` callback. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `drain` function has side effects or if the `drain.on` method has different behavior than the original `drain` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.on('error', done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `drain` function, while this code fragment calls the `drain.on` method with the `'error'` event and the `done` callback. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `drain` function has side effects or if the `drain.on` method has different behavior than the original `drain` function.
