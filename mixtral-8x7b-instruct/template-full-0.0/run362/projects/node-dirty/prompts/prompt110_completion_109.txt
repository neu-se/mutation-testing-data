 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event is being listened to and handled, while 'warn' is not. This change would cause the code to ignore warnings during the execution of the `_load` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'customError'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'customError' event is not emitted by the `_readStream` in the `_load` method. This change would cause the code to ignore any errors that might occur during the execution of the `_load` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
