  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z` variable is a different object, and the `isInfinite` property may have a different value than `this['isInfinite']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['ZERO']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['ZERO']` is a different value than `this['isInfinite']`, and may lead to different code execution paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isZero']()` is a function that may have a different implementation than `this['isInfinite']`, and may lead to different code execution paths.

DONE.
