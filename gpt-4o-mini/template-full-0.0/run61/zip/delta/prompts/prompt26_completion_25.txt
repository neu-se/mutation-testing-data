Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, which would not correctly check the length of the keys in the `attributes` object, potentially leading to incorrect results when determining if there are any differences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the condition to check for equality to zero would return `attributes` when it is empty, which is the opposite of the original logic that returns `undefined` when there are no keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because checking if the length is less than zero is logically impossible (length cannot be negative), which would always evaluate to `false`, thus incorrectly returning `attributes` even when it is empty.

DONE.
