 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the second argument to `getCountryForTimezone`, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable, which might contain custom values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the second argument to `getCountryForTimezone`, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable, which might contain custom values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.someNonExistentProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the property `someNonExistentProperty` from the `options` object, which would result in `undefined` if the property doesn't exist. The original code simply passes the `options` variable as the second argument to `getCountryForTimezone`.

DONE.
