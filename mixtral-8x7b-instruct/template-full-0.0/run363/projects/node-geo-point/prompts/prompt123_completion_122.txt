 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to use the coordinates of the current instance instead of the provided `point`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same constant bearing value (North), regardless of the provided `point`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * 360
