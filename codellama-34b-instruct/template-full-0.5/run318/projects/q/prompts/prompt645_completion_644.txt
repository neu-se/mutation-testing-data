  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.mapply` would receive `null` as the first argument, which is not a promise or an immediate reference for a target object, and would therefore throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.mapply` would receive `undefined` as the first argument, which is not a promise or an immediate reference for a target object, and would therefore throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.mapply` would receive `1` as the first argument, which is not a promise or an immediate reference for a target object, and would therefore throw an error.

DONE.
