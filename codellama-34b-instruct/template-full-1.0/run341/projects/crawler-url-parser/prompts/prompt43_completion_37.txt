  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function expects the second argument to be a boolean value indicating whether to parse the query string, and passing `false` would cause the query string to be ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function expects the second argument to be a boolean value or `undefined`, and passing `undefined` would cause the function to use the default value of `true` for parsing the query string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function expects the second argument to be a boolean value or `null`, and passing `null` would cause the function to use the default value of `true` for parsing the query string.

DONE.
