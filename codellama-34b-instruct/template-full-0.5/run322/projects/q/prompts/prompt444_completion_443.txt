  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit()` function to be called with `null` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit()` function to be called with `undefined` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `process.emit()` function to be called with `0` as the second argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
