  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [void 0, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
