  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of an object's properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.` is a syntax error and would cause the code to fail to compile.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a, b) => Object.keys(a) + Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string concatenation of the keys of the `a` and `b` objects, while the original code Fragment returns an array of the keys.

DONE.
