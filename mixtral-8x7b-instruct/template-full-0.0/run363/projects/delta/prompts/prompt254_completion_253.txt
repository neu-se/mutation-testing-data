 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop in certain conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the previous operation, which is not equivalent to the next operation in the context of the diff algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext ? otherIter.next() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a null check, which is not present in the original code. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the `otherIter` does not have a next operation.

DONE.
