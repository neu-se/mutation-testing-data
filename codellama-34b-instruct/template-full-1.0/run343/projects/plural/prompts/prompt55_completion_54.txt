  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/f/g, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the character "f" with "ves" only if it is the last character of the word, while this replacement would replace all occurrences of "f" with "ves," resulting in different outputs for words like "buffalo" and "flamingo."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/f/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the character "f" with "ves" only if it is the last character of the word, while this replacement would replace the first occurrence of "f" with "ves," resulting in different outputs for words like "bottlef" and "cuff."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/.+/g, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the character "f"
