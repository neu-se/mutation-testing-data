  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` would return the first character of the word, while the new code fragment `1` would return the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` would return the first character of the word, while the new code fragment `-1` would return the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `0` would return the first character of the word, while the new code fragment `word.length - 1` would return the last character of the word.

DONE.
