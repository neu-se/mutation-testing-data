  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition, making the `if` statement always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.call === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `callback` is a function, but it would use the `call` method instead of the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.bind === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `callback` is a function, but it would use the `bind` method instead of the `apply` method.

DONE.
