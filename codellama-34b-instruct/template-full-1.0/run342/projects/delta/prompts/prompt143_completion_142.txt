  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra operation in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the operation twice.

DONE.
