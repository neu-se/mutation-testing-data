  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\//g, '\\');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is looking for forward slashes (`/`) and replacing them with backslashes (`\`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\//g, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is looking for forward slashes (`/`) and replacing them with an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\//g, ' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is looking for forward slashes (`/`) and replacing them with a space.

DONE.
