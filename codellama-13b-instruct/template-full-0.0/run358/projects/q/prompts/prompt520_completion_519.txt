  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid way to resolve, reject, and notify a deferred object, while the buggy code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid way to resolve, reject, and notify a deferred object, while the buggy code fragment is not.
