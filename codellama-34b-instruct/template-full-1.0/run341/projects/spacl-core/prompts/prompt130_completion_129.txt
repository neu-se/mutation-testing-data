  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index <= count; index
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count + 1; index
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count; index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other iteration of the loop.

DONE.
