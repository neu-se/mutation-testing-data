 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function checks if the rejected argument is truthy, and if not, it does not remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array. By replacing `reason` with `null`, the function will not remove the rejection from the array, and it will still be treated as unhandled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function checks if the rejected argument is truthy, and if not, it does not remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array. By replacing `reason` with `undefined`, the function will not remove the rejection from the array, and it will still be treated as unhandled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function
