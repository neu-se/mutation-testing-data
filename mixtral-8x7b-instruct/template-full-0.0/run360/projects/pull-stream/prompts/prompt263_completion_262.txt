 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data.slice())
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a copy of the `data` array, which may not be expected by the test suite. The original code just passes the `data` array itself, so any modifications to it further down the line will affect the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
