 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the currentUrlStr to lowercase, which might not match the expected behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the currentUrlStr to a string, which might not match the expected behavior of the original code fragment if the input is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty string if currentUrlStr is falsy, which might not match the expected behavior of the original code fragment if the input is expected to be a non-empty string.

DONE.
