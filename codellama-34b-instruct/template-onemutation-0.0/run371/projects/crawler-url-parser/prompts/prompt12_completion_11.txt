  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `http` protocol, while the new code fragment uses the `https` protocol. This could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the `https` protocol.
