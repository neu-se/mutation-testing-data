  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(v => v !== null).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` will remove any null values from the array before mapping, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(1).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will return a new array with the first element removed, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reverse().map
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` will reverse the order of the array, which may not be desirable.

DONE.
