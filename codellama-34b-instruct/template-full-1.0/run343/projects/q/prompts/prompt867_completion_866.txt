  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
return deferred.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the Error object instead of resolving it with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value instead of rejecting it with the Error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
throw new Error("This is a different error");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different Error message.
