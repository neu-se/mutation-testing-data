  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInternalFrame` function would now check if the stack line is in uppercase, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInternalFrame` function would now check if the stack line is in lowercase, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substring(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInternalFrame` function would now check if the first 10 characters of the stack line match the expected pattern, which could potentially cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
