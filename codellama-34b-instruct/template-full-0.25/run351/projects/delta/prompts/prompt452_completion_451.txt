  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this.hasNext` would always return the opposite of `this.hasNext`, which means that if `this.hasNext` returns `true`, `!this.hasNext` would return `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to always execute the `else` block, even if there are more operations to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext && this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasNext` would only return `true` if there are more operations to be processed, but `this.index < this.ops.length` would always return `true` if `this.index` is less than the length of `this.ops`. This would cause the `if` statement to always execute the `else` block, even if there are more operations to be processed.
