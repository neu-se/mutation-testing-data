 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the exponential function, which is not the same as raising a number to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
10 ** places
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the exponentiation operator (`**`) instead of the `Math.pow` function. The behavior may differ for negative exponents.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.LN10 * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the natural logarithm of 10 (`Math.LN10`) instead of the base 10 logarithm. This would lead to incorrect results when calculating the power of a number.

DONE.
