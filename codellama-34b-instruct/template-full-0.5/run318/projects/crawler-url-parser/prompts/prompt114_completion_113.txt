  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `urlMap` object instead of the values, which could lead to unexpected results in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `urlMap` object in reverse order, which could lead to unexpected results in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values().slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the `urlMap` object starting from the second element, which could lead to unexpected results in the `gettype` function.

DONE.
