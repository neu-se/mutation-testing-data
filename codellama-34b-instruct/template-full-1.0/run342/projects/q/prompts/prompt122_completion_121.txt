  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `for...in` loop would iterate over all enumerable properties of the object, while in the mutated code, the loop would not iterate at all since `undefined` is not an object and it does not have any enumerable properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: value}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `for...in` loop would iterate over all enumerable properties of the object, while in the mutated code, the loop would only iterate over the `key` property since the `value` property is not enumerable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Symbol('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `for...in` loop would iterate over all enumerable properties of the object, while in the mutated code, the loop would not iterate at all since `Symbol` properties are not
