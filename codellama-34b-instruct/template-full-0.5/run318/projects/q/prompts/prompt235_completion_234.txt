  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `args` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat(args, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_concat` returns a new array containing the elements of the original array, whereas `args` is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice(args, 0, args.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` removes elements from the original array and returns a new array containing the removed elements, whereas `args` is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
