  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `resolvedPromise` variable, potentially allowing the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise && resolvedPromise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled()` method would check if the promise has already been fulfilled, and if so, would not allow the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise && resolvedPromise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending()` method would check if the promise is still pending, and if so, would allow the `deferred.fulfill` method to be called.

DONE.
