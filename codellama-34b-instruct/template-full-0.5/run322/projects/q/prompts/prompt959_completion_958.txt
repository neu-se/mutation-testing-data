  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` returns a reversed version of the original array, which would cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.shift()` removes the first element of the array and returns it, which would cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.pop()` removes the last element of the array and returns it, which would cause the function to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
