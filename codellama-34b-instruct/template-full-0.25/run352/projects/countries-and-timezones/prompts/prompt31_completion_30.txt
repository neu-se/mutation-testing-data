  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
minutes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function expects the `offset` parameter to be a number of hours, but `minutes` would be a number of minutes. This would cause the function to return an incorrect offset string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function expects the `offset` parameter to be a number of hours, but `offset / 60` would be a number of minutes. This would cause the function to return an incorrect offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset % 60
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function expects the `offset` parameter to be a number of hours, but `offset % 60` would be the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, which would be a number of minutes. This would cause the function to return an
