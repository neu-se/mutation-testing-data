 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior when the input is 0, causing division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an exponential function, which is not present in the original code, and may cause unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the 're' property of the current object, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

DONE.
