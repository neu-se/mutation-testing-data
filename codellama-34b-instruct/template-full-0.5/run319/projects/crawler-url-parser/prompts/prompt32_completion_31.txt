  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while 'https://' would replace the protocol with 'https'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while 'ftp://' would replace the protocol with 'ftp'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'javascript:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while 'javascript:' would replace the protocol with 'javascript'.

DONE.
