  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "samelevel" for links with the same domain and path, regardless of the subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "samelevel" for links with the same domain and path, regardless of the subdomain, and would also include the placeholder text in the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return "samelevel" for links with the same domain and path, regardless of the subdomain, and would also return null for links with a different domain.

DONE.
