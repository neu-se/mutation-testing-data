  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` as an array of arguments to `nodeArgs`, while the mutated code would pass an empty array as the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` as an array of arguments to `nodeArgs`, while the mutated code would pass an empty function as the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes `args` as an array of arguments to `nodeArgs`, while the mutated code would pass `undefined` as the arguments.

DONE.
