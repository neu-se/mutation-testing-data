Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially changing the calculated hours in the `getOffsetStr` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset => offset / 60
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would not perform any rounding, resulting in a floating-point number for hours, whereas `Math.floor` returns an integer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, which could produce different results than `Math.floor` when the fractional part of the offset is exactly 0.5, due to the way `Math.round` handles this case (it rounds to the nearest even integer).

DONE.
