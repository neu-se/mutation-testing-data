  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a plus sign between `r` and `a`, while the new code fragment has a minus sign. This would cause the result of the expression to be different, which could potentially cause the `sqrt` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
