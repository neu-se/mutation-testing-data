  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
