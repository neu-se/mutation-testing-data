  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra newline character at the end of the string, which may not be desired in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the newline character at the end of the string, which may not be desired in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL.repeat(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add two newline characters at the end of the string, which may not be desired in some cases.

DONE.
