  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl` and `baseUrl` are different objects, and `currentUrl.baseurl` would return `undefined`, whereas `baseUrl` would return the base URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.url` would return the URL string, whereas `currentUrl` would return the URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse(currentUrl.url)` would return a URL object, whereas `baseUrl` would return the base URL object.

DONE.
