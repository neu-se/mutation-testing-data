Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `query` method instead of the `matches` method, potentially leading to unexpected results since `query` is designed to check permissions based on action verbs, not just path matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the result of the `matches` method, meaning that if the policy does match the path, the method will incorrectly return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return `false` regardless of whether the policy matches the path or not, effectively rendering the matches check useless.

DONE.
