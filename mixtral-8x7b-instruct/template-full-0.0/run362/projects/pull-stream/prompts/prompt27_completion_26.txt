 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 1 instead of the `read` value in the case where there are exactly 3 arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a random value instead of the `read` value in the case where there are exactly 3 arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value of the loop variable `i` instead of the `read` value in the case where there are exactly 3 arguments.

DONE.
