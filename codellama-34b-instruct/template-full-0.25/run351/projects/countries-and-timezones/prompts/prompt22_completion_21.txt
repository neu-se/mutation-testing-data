  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `tz.d` value, which could change the result of the `Number.isInteger()` check and affect the calculation of the `dstOffset` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the `tz.d` value, which could change the result of the `Number.isInteger()` check and affect the calculation of the `dstOffset` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.d - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the `tz.d` value, which could change the result of the `Number.isInteger()` check and affect the calculation of the `dstOffset` value.

DONE.
