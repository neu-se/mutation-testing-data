  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the result of the `all()` function, which would then be passed to the `spread()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the result of the `all()` function, which would then be passed to the `spread()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the result of the `all()` function, which would then be passed to the `spread()` function.

DONE.
