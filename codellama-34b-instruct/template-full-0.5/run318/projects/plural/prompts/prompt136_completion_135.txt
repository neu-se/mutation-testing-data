  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function defined in the code that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof Object` is an expression that returns the type of the `Object` constructor, which is different from the type of an object created with the `Object` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.call(Object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `type.call(Object)` is a function call that returns the type of the `Object` constructor, which is different from the type of an object created with the `Object` constructor.

DONE.
