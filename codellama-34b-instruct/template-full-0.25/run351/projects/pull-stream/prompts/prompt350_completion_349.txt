  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function, while `prop` is an object. The `test` function is expecting an object, so passing a function would cause it to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test()` is a function call, while `prop` is an object. The `test` function is expecting an object, so passing a function call would cause it to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.bind(prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test.bind(prop)` is a bound function, while `prop` is an object. The `test` function is expecting an object, so passing a bound function would cause it to fail.

DONE.
