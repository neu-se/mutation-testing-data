  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the negated value would be `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `shouldThrow` is not strictly equal to `true`, the condition would evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `shouldThrow` is strictly equal to `false`, the condition would evaluate to `true`, even if `shouldThrow` is falsy.

DONE.
