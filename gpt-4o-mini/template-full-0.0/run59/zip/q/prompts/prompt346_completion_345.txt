Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of the caught `exception` would cause the promise to resolve successfully instead of being rejected, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string instead of the actual `exception` would not provide the original error context, making it harder for the caller to understand what went wrong.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because returning the `value` instead of the `exception` would cause the promise to resolve with the fulfilled value instead of rejecting, which could lead to incorrect handling of errors in the promise chain.

DONE.
