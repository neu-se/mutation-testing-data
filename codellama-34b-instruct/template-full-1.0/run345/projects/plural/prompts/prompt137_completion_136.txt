  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a different variable than `rule[1]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0][1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rules[0][1]` is a different variable than `rule[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function() {}` is a different type of object than `rule[1]`.

DONE.
