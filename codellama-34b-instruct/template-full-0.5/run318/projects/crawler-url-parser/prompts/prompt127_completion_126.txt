  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.href` is a string representing the URL of the link, whereas `linkurl` is an object containing information about the link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the link (e.g., "http" or "https"), whereas `linkurl` is an object containing information about the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.host` is a string representing the hostname of the link (e.g., "www.example.com"), whereas `linkurl` is an object containing information about the link.

DONE.
