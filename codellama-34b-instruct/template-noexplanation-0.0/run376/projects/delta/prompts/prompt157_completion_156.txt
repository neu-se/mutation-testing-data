  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will always push the next operation from the `other` iterator, regardless of whether it is an insert or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will always push the next operation from the `other` iterator, regardless of whether it is a delete or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This change will cause the `compose` method to behave differently than the original code, as it will always push the next operation from the `other` iterator, regardless of whether it is a retain or not.

DONE.
