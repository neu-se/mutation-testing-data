  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would empty the entire array instead of just removing the element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport - 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the wrong element from the array, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.push("");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an empty string to the array instead of removing an element, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
