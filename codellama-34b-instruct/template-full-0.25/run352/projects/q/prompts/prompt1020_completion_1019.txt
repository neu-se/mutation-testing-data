  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a different method than "post" and would cause the code to execute a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because "dispatch" is a different method than "post" and would cause the code to execute a different function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is a different method than "post" and would cause the code to execute a different function.

DONE.
