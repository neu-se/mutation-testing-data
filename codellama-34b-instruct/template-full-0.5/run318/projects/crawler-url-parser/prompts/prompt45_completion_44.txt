  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would not be parsed with `true` and `true` as the second and third arguments, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be treated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would not be parsed with `true` as the second argument, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be treated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would not be parsed with `true` as the third argument, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be treated differently.

DONE.
