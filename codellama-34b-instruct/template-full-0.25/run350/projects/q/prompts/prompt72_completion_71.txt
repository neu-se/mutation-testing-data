  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain time interval, and it would cause the `flush` function to be executed after 0 milliseconds, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain time interval, and it would cause the `flush` function to be executed after 1000 milliseconds, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
