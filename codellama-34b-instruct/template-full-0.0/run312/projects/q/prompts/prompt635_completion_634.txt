  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `null`, whereas the original code would have thrown an error if `object` was not a promise or an immediate reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `undefined`, whereas the original code would have thrown an error if `object` was not a promise or an immediate reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.del` would throw an error when trying to access the `dispatch` method of `0`, whereas the original code would have thrown an error if `object` was not a promise or an immediate reference.

DONE.
