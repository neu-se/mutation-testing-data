  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'object' && newOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is an object and has a length greater than 0, which would be a more robust check than just checking if it is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null && typeof newOp.attributes === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is not null and is an object, which would be a more robust check than just checking if it is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes != null && typeof newOp.attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `attributes` property of `newOp` is not
