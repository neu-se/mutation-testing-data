  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var qFileName = captureLine();
```
This would result in different behavior because `qFileName` would be assigned the value of the current line number, rather than the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var qFileName = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because `qFileName` would be assigned the string "foo", rather than the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var qFileName = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `qFileName` would be assigned the value `null`, rather than the file name.

DONE.
