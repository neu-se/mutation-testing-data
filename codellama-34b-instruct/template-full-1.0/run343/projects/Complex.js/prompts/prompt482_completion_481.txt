  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this['im']`, which is used in the `isInfinite` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this['re']`, which is used in the `isFinite` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of `this['re']` and `this['im']`, which are used in both the `isFinite` and `isInfinite` methods.

DONE.
