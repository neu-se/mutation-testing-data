Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of `this` to the current element in the jQuery iteration, which may not be the same as the intended element, potentially leading to incorrect href values being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(el).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the variable `el`, which refers to the current element in the iteration, instead of `this`, which may lead to different href values being accessed if the context of `this` is not the same as `el`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').eq(i).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly selects the anchor element at index `i` in the jQuery collection, which may not correspond to the current element in the iteration, potentially leading to incorrect href values being retrieved.

DONE.
