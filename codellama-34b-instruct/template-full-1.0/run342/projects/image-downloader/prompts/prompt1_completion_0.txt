  Please let me know if these comply with the prompt:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `!!` is the negative operator, and it would always evaluate to `false`, even if `options.url` exists. In the original code, `!options.url` would evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` would always evaluate to `false` regardless of its value. In the original code, `!options.url` would evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 options.url === undefined || options.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.url` would always evaluate to `true` if `options.url` is undefined or null. In the original
