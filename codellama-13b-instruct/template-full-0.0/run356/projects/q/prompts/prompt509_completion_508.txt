  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword refers to the global object in the context of the `rejected` function, whereas in the original code, it refers to the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `thisp` is not a valid identifier and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value that can be used as a placeholder, whereas `thisp` is not a valid identifier and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
