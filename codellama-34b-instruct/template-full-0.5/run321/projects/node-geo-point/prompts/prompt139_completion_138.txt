  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the result of the `adjust` function, which would cause the `longitude` value to be incremented by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the result of the `adjust` function by 2, which would cause the `longitude` value to be doubled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the result of the `adjust` function, which would cause the `longitude` value to be decremented by 1.

DONE.
