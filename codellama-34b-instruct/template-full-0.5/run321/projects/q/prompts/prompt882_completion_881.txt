  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called twice, which could cause the promise to be rejected twice, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method would be called instead of `fail`, which could cause the promise to be rejected in a different way, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called instead of `fail`, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected in a different way, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
