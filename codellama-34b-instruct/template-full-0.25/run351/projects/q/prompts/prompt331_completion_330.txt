  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `resolve`, so the promise would be resolved even if the original code would have rejected it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the promise would be resolved with the value `false` even if the original code would have rejected it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, so the promise would be resolved with the value `true` even if the original code would have rejected it.

DONE.
