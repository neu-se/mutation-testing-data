  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, which may not exist or may have a different value than the original `baseOp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof baseOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to the type of the `baseOp` object, which may not be the same as the expected type of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to the length of the `baseOp` object, which may not be the same as the expected length of the expression.

DONE.
