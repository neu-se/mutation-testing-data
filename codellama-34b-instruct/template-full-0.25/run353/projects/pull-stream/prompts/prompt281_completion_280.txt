  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `mapper` function, causing it to always return `false` regardless of its original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `mapper` function, potentially causing it to return a different value than it would have without the mutation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the context of the `mapper` function, potentially causing it to behave differently than it would have without the mutation.

DONE.
