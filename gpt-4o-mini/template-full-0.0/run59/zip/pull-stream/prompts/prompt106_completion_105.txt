Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of the `done` function would lead to a runtime error when `drain` attempts to invoke it, as `undefined` is not a callable function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `done` with an empty arrow function means that the original functionality of `done` will not be executed, potentially leading to incomplete operations or unhandled states in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'completed'
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string instead of the `done` function would likely cause `drain` to treat it as a non-function value, leading to unexpected behavior or errors when it tries to call it as a function.

DONE.
