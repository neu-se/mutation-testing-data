  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an "s" to the end of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in a "ch" sound. In the original code, the "ch" rule only applies when the word ends in "ch" or "s."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the letter "e" followed by the number 1 to the end of the word, regardless of whether the word ends in "ch" or "s." In the original code, the "ch" rule only applies when the word ends in "ch" or "s."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w[0] + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only add "es" to
