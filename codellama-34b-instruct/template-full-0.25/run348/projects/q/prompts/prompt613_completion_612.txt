  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` operation would be performed with `undefined` as the value, which would overwrite the existing value of the property with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would be performed on the property, which would remove it from the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` operation would be performed with an additional argument `0`, which would cause the method to return the first element of the property value, rather than the value itself.

DONE.
