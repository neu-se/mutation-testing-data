  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', err);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the error object, while the buggy code fragment emits an error event with the error object and a stringified version of the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the error object, while the buggy code fragment emits an error event with a new error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', err.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the error object, while the buggy code fragment emits an error event with the error message.

DONE.
