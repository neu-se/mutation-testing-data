  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that holds the current value of the accumulator, while the new code fragment `acc + 1` increments the accumulator by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that holds the current value of the accumulator, while the new code fragment `acc - 1` decrements the accumulator by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is a variable that holds the current value of the accumulator, while the new code fragment `acc * 2` multiplies the accumulator by 2.

DONE.
