  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because "del" is a different operator than "delete", and it would cause the code to use the "del" operator instead of the "delete" operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because "remove" is a different method than "delete", and it would cause the code to use the "remove" method instead of the "delete" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to concatenate the string "foo" to the string "delete", resulting in the string "deletefoo", which is a different operator than "delete".

DONE.
