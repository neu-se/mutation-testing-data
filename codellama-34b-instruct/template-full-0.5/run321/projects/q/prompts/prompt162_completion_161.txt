  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `split` have different purposes and usage. While `split` is used to split a string into an array of substrings, `slice` is used to extract a subset of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `split` have different purposes and usage. While `split` is used to split a string into an array of substrings, `substring` is used to extract a subset of a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` and `split` have different purposes and usage. While `split` is used to split a string into an array of substrings, `substr` is used to extract a subset of a string.

DONE.
