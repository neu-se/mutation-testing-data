  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  [embedType]: handler.transform(
    thisData[embedType],
    otherData[embedType],
    !priority,
  ),
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `priority` parameter is negated, which would cause the transformation to be applied in the opposite order.
