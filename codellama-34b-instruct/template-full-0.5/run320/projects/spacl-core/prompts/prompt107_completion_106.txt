  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method changes the case of the string to lowercase, which could cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace('a', 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method replaces all occurrences of the letter 'a' with the letter 'b', which could cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods change the order of the characters in the string, which could cause the `matches` method to return a different result.

DONE.
