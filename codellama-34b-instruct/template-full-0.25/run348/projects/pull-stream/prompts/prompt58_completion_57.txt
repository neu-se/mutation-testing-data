  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done === undefined` would always be false, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof done` would always be `'function'`, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done.length` would always be 1, even if `done` is not provided as an argument.

DONE.
