 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('../url_parser_mutation_test/bad_parse')
```
This would result in different behavior because `bad_parse` is a hypothetical module that does not properly parse URLs, unlike the original `URL.parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse('javascript:...')
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows JavaScript URLs, which are not allowed by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(href, true, false)
