  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether the "insert" property of "otherOp" is a string, and if it is, it is using it to slice the "strings" array. If "otherOp" is null, the "insert" property will also be null, and the slice will result in an empty string, which is likely to cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking whether the "insert" property of "otherOp" is a string, and if it is, it is using it to slice the "strings" array. If "otherOp" is a string, the "insert" property will also be a string, and the slice will result in a non-empty string, which is likely to cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
