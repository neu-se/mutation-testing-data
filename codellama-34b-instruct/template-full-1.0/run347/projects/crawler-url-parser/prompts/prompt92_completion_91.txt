  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
el.attr('cy')
```
This would result in different behavior because `cy` is a different attribute than `href`, and the `attr` function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
el.text()
```
This would result in different behavior because `text()` would return the text content of the element, whereas `href` would return the URL of the link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
el.attr('href', 'javascript:void(0)')
```
This would result in different behavior because `javascript:void(0)` is a different URL than the original link, and the modified link would not work as intended.

DONE.
