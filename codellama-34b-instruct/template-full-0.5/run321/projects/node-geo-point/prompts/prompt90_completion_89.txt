  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, whereas `sin` is the sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is the sine function from the `Math` class, whereas `sin` is the sine function from the global scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(θ)` is the sine function applied to the angle `θ`, whereas `sin` is the sine function applied to the angle `θ` in the global scope.

DONE.
