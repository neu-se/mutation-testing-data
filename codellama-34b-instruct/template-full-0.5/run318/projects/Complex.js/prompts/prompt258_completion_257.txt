  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true only when `b` is equal to 0 and `a` is less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true only when `a` is equal to 0 and `b` is less than 0.

DONE.
