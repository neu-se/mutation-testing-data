  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` is a method that removes elements from an array, while `array_slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` returns the number of elements in an array, while `array_slice` returns a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to represent the `undefined` value in JavaScript, while `array_slice` is a method that takes an array as an argument.

DONE.
