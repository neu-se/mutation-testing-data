  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array, while `promises` references the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `promises` array, while `promises` references the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function (promise) { return promise.state === "fulfilled"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out any promises that are not in the "fulfilled" state, while `promises` references the complete array of promises.

DONE.
