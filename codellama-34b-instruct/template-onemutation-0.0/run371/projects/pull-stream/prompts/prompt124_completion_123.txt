  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, which is a function. In the original code, `cb` is called if it is defined, but with the modified code, `cb` is called if it is not defined. This change in behavior could potentially cause the code to fail if the `cb` function is not defined.

DONE.
