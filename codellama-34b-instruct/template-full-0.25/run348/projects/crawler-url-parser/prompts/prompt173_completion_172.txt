  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Testing mutation testing");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the result of the `gettype` function, while this modified code logs a hardcoded string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(gettype(linkurl, pageurl));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the result of the `gettype` function, while this modified code logs the result of the `gettype` function with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(gettype(linkurl, pageurl) + " " + gettype(pageurl, linkurl));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code logs the result of the `gettype` function with one set of arguments, while this modified code logs the result of the `gettype` function with two sets of arguments.

DONE.
