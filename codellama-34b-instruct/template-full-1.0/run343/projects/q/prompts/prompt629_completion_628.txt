  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the positional arguments are swapped, which could cause issues if the function is relying on the specific order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [object, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the object being set is passed as the first argument, which could cause issues if the function is relying on a specific object being passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is null, which could cause issues if the function is relying on a specific value being set.

DONE.
