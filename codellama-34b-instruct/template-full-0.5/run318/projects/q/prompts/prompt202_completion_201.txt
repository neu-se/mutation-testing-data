  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks for the presence of a substring within a string, while `length` returns the length of a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks for the presence of a substring within a string, while `charAt(0)` returns the character at the specified index within a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].replace(lines[0], " ")
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` checks for the presence of a substring within a string, while `replace` replaces all occurrences of a substring within a string.

DONE.
