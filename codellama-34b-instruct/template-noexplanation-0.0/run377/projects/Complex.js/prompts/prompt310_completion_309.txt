  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This change will cause the `cos` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
