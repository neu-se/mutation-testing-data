  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort;
```
This would result in a syntax error because the semicolon at the end of the line would be treated as a statement, rather than part of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would only evaluate to `true` if `abort` is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would evaluate to `abort` regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort; cb(aborted);
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment would execute two statements, `abort;` and `cb(aborted);`, whereas the original code fragment would only execute one statement, `abort;`.

DONE.
