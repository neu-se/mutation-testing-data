  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `aborted` if it is truthy, but this code fragment would always return `aborted` regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `aborted` if it is truthy, but this code fragment would return `aborted` only if it is exactly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `aborted` if it is truthy, but this code fragment would return `aborted` if it is falsy.

DONE.
