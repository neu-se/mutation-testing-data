 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an empty object, which would not have the same properties as `pageurl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window.pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `pageurl` property of the `window` object, which may not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"pageurl"
