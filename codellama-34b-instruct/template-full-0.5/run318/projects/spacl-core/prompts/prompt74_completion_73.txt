  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the policy to return `true` for actions that were previously denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the policy to return `false` for actions that were previously allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the policy to return `null` for actions that were previously governed by the policy.

DONE.
