  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the value of `val`, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `val` to the `fn` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always double the value of `val`, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `val` to the `fn` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `val` array to the `fn` function, whereas the original code fragment simply passes the value of `val` to the `fn` function.

DONE.
