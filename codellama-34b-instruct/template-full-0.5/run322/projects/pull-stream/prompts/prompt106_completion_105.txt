  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function call, while the new code fragment `done(null)` is a function call with a null argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function call, while the new code fragment `done(undefined)` is a function call with an undefined argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function call, while the new code fragment `done(new Error())` is a function call with a new Error object as an argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
