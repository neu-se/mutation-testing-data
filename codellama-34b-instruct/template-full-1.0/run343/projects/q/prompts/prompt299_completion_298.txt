  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++y
```
This would result in different behavior because `++y` is a prefix increment operator, which increments the value of `y` and then returns the new value, while `y++` is a postfix increment operator, which returns the value of `y` and then increments it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y = y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `y += 1` is short hand for `y = y + 1`, but `y = y + 1` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `y + 1` is the same as `++y`, but it does not increment the value of `y`.

DONE.
