  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds the number to the nearest integer, while `parseFloat` rounds to the nearest decimal place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` converts the input to a number, while `parseFloat` extracts the floating-point number from the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` converts the input to a string, while `parseFloat` extracts the floating-point number from the input.

DONE.
