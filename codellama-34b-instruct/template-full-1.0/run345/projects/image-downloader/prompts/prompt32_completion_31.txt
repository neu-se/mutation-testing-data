  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would not trigger the `reject` function on status codes between 201 and 299, which may be legitimate status codes but were not accounted for in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would trigger the `reject` function on status code 300, even though this status code is typically used for redirection and may not indicate an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode >= 500 && res.statusCode < 600
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would trigger the `reject` function on status codes between 500 and 599, which are typically used for server errors.

DONE.
