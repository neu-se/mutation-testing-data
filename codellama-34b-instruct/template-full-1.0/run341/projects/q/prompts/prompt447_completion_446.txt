  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise, which is different from the original code that used `reject` as a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.fulfill(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.fulfill` creates a fulfilled promise, which is different from the original code that used `fulfill` as a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, which is different from the original code that used `reject` as a variable.

DONE.
