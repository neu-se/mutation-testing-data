  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TypeError()
```
This would result in different behavior because `TypeError` is a different error type than `TimeoutError`, and it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different error message than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request failed')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a different error message than the original code.

DONE.
