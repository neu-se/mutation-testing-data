Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join
```
This would result in different behavior because `join` concatenates the elements of the array into a single string without any accumulator function, which would not produce the intended regex pattern but rather a simple string representation of the parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.map(seg => seg.toUpperCase()).reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because this change transforms each segment to uppercase before concatenating them, which would alter the regex pattern to match uppercase segments instead of the original case-sensitive matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.filter(seg => seg.length > 1).reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, '$')
```
This would result in different behavior because this change filters out segments that are one character or less before reducing, potentially omitting valid segments from the final regex pattern, leading to incorrect matching behavior.

DONE.
