 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['query']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `query` method using bracket notation instead of dot notation, which can lead to issues if the `query` property is not defined or is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx || {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the optional `ctx` parameter by providing an empty object if it is not provided, potentially causing issues if the `rule.query` method relies on `ctx` being `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.execute(path, verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method called on the `rule` object from `query` to `execute`, which is not a method defined in the `Rule` class, leading to a method not found error.

DONE.
