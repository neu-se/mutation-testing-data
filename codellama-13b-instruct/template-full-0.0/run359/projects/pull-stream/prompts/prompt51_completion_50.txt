  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `==` operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used instead of the `==` operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator is used instead of the `==` operator, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
