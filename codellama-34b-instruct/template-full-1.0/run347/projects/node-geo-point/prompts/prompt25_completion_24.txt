  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the existence of the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the value of the `longitude` property in the `point` object, instead of checking for its presence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of the `latitude` property in the `point` object, instead of checking for its value.

DONE.
