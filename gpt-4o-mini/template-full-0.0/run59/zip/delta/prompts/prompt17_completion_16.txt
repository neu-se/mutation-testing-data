Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would lead to incorrect comparisons in the `reduce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs, which would change the structure of the data being processed and potentially lead to incorrect attribute mapping.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because filtering the keys to only those that start with 'a' would exclude any other keys from `b`, leading to incomplete or incorrect attribute differences being calculated.

DONE.
