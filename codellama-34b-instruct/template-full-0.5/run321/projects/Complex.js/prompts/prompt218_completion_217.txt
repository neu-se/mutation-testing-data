  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different output values for the same input values, which means that the resulting complex number would have a different real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` returns the arccosine of a number, which is different from the cosine of a number. The resulting complex number would have a different real part and a different imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it has a different value than the output of `Math.cos`. The resulting complex number would have a different real part and a different imaginary part.

DONE.
