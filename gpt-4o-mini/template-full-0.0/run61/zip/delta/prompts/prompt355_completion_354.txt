Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof arg === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat a string as a valid argument type, causing the function to attempt to transform a string instead of a number or Delta, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg instanceof Delta
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow instances of Delta to pass through, rejecting numbers and potentially causing the function to skip necessary transformations for numeric indices, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat a null value as a valid case, causing the function to attempt to process a null argument instead of handling it as an invalid input, which could lead to null reference errors or incorrect processing logic.

DONE.
