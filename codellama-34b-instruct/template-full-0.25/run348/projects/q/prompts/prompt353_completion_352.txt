  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a new error, regardless of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error synchronously, rather than returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a new error, rather than throwing an error synchronously.

DONE.
