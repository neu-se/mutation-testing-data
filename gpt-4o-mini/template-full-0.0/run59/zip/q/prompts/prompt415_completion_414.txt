Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly identify any object as a pending promise, including non-promise objects, leading to false positives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true for null values, thus failing to identify any actual promise objects as pending, which would lead to incorrect handling of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify fulfilled promises as pending, which would disrupt the intended logic of distinguishing between promise states.

DONE.
