 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function would return true, causing the function to exit prematurely, whereas the original code would treat NaN values as valid and continue processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parser_exit()` function would not be called, and the function would continue processing, whereas the original code would exit the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
