  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is used in the `nextTick` function, and replacing it with `null` would cause the function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is used in the `nextTick` function, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is used in the `nextTick` function, and replacing it with a string would cause the function to fail.

DONE.
