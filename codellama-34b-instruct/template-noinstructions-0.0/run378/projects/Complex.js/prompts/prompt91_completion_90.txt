  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would parse the next token as a float, whereas the original code fragment would parse the current token as a float.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the next token as the argument to `parseFloat`, whereas the original code fragment would use the current token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current token as the argument to `parseFloat`, whereas the original code fragment would use the next token.

DONE.
