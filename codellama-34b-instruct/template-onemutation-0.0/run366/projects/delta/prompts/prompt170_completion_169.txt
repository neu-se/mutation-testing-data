  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `next` method to be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the `next` method and the rest of the code that follows.

DONE.
