  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` would return a new array with the transformed elements, while `filter` would return a new array with the elements that passed the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` would execute the provided function once for each element in the array, while `filter` would return a new array with the elements that passed the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` would return a single value that is the result of combining the elements of the array using the provided function, while `filter` would return a new array with the elements that passed the test implemented by the provided function.

DONE.
