  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code fragment uses the `text` property, which returns the text content of the element, including any child elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).html().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code fragment uses the `html()` method, which returns the HTML content of the element, including any child elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).val().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code fragment uses the `val()` method, which returns the value of the element, which may be different from the text content
