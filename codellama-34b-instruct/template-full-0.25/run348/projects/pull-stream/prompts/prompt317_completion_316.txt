  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `null` as the first argument, even if the `ended` variable is set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with the `ended` variable as the first argument, even if the `ended` variable is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
