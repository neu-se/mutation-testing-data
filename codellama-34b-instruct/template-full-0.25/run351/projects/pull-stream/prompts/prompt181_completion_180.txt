  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment simply references the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with a `null` context, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a context for the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.apply(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with a `null` context and no arguments, whereas the original code fragment does not specify a context or arguments for the function call.

DONE.
