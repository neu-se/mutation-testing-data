  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects a promise or an immediate value as its first argument, but `null` is neither of those. If `null` is passed, `Q.when` will throw a `TypeError` because it cannot determine the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects a promise or an immediate value as its first argument, but `undefined` is neither of those. If `undefined` is passed, `Q.when` will throw a `TypeError` because it cannot determine the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` expects a promise or an immediate value as its first argument, but `Promise.reject()` is a rejected promise. If a rejected promise is passed, `Q.when` will
