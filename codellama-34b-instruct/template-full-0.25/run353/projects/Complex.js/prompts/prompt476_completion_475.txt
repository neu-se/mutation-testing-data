  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` is the negation of `isFinite`, which means that the function would return `true` if the number is not finite, rather than `false` if the number is not finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a function that checks if a value is not a number, whereas `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a function that checks if a value is infinite, whereas `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite.

DONE.
