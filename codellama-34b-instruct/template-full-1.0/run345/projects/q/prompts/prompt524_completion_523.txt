  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise({
    "isDef": function () {}
}, function fallback() {
    return object;
}, function inspect() {
    return { state: "fulfilled", value: object };
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isDef` method would not be called on the placeholder object, and the placeholder object would not be logged as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isDef` method would be called on `null`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isDef` method would be called on `undefined`, which would cause an error.

DONE.
