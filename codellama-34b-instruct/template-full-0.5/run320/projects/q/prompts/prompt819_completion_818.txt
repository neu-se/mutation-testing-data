  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would not be called, and the progress notification would not be forwarded to the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with an empty function as the argument, which would not have the same effect as the original `progress` function.

DONE.
