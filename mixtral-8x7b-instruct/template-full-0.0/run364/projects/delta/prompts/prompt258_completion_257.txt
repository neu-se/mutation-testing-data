 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because if `thisOp.insert` is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string), it will now return an empty string instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `delete` property of the `thisOp` object instead of the `insert` property, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if the `delete` property does not exist or has an inappropriate value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp['insert']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation instead of dot notation to access the `insert` property. While this is functionally equivalent in most cases, it can lead to different behavior if the `insert` property is shadowed by another property with the same name in the object's prototype chain
