  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Incorrect Parameter'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would still throw an error, but with a different message, which could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Parameter'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would still throw an error, but with a different message that is still grammatically correct, but has a different meaning than the original message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Parameters'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would still throw an error, but with a different message that indicates that multiple parameters are invalid, rather than just one.

DONE.
