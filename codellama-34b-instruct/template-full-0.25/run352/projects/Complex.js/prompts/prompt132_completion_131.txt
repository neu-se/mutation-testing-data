  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `||` operator, which checks if either `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()` is true, while the new code fragment uses the `&&` operator, which checks if both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `&&` operator, which checks if both `this['isInfinite']()` and `z['isInfinite']()` are true, while the new code fragment uses the `||` operator, which checks if either `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()` is true.
