  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, if `line.pop` was used instead of `line.push`, the `concat` function would end up with one fewer element in `delta.ops` than it should have.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array containing the concatenation of the two input arrays, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, if `delta.concat(line)` was used instead of `line.push`, the `concat` function would end up with two copies of `line` in `delta.ops`, which would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because
