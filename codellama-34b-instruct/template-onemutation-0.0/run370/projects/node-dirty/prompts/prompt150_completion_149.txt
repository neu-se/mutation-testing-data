  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object to the callback function, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the callback function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
