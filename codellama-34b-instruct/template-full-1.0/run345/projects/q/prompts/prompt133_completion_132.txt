  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math` is a built-in object in JavaScript that provides mathematical constants and functions, and it is not a valid replacement for `Object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that represents the absence of a meaningful value, and it is not a valid replacement for `Object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `function () {}` is a function expression that creates a new function, and it is not a valid replacement for `Object`.

DONE.
