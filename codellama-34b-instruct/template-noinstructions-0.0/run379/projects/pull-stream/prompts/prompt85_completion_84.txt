  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb || function () {}` checks if `cb` is a function and returns it if it is, while the new code fragment `function () {}` always returns a new function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb || function () {}` checks if `cb` is a function and returns it if it is, while the new code fragment `null` always returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb || function () {}` checks if `cb` is a function and returns it if it is, while the new code fragment `undefined` always returns `undefined`.

DONE.
