  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.length` would return the length of the string `part`, whereas `part` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `part[0]` would return the first character of the string `part`, whereas `part` would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.split('')` would return an array of single-character strings, whereas `part` would return the entire string.

DONE.
