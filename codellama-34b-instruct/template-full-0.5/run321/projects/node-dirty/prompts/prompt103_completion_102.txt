  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` is the value of the key-value pair, while `row.key` is the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key + 1` would add 1 to the key, which could result in a different key being used for the lookup.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(row.key)` would retrieve the value associated with the key from the `this._data` map, while `row.key` would simply return the key itself.

DONE.
