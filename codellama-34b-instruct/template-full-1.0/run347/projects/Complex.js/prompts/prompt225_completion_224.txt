  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is equal to 0, whereas the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause the code to skip the calculation of `Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a))` when `b` is 0, which could result in wrong calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the condition and skip the calculation when `b` is not equal to 0. This would mean that the calculation of the square root would be skipped when `b` is not 0, which could result in wrong calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check that `b` is less than 0, whereas the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0. This change would cause
