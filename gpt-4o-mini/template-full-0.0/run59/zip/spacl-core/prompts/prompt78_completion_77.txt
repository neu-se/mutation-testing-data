Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first rule in the `rules` array, potentially leading to a situation where the policy does not consider the first rule when checking if a path is governed by the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.concat(new Rule('dummy', () => false))
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a dummy rule that always returns false, which could cause the `matches` method to return false even if there are valid rules that should match the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter(r => r.isActive)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only iterates over rules that are marked as active, potentially ignoring inactive rules that may still govern the path, leading to incorrect results in the `matches` method.

DONE.
