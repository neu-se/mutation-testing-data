  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be `null`, which is not an object, and would throw an error when trying to access the `apply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and would throw an error when trying to access the `apply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a number, and would throw an error when trying to access the `apply` method.

DONE.
