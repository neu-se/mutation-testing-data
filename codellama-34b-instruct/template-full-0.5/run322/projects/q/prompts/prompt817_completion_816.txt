  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is used to handle the rejection of a promise, rather than the fulfillment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is used to handle the progress of a promise, rather than the fulfillment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would not be called at all, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
