  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. The `stringify` function would throw an error when trying to access the `reviver` property of `null`, whereas the original code would use the `reviver` property of the `options` object.

DONE.
