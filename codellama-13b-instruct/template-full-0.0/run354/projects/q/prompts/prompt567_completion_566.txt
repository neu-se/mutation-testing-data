  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `result` object, while this code fragment only returns the `value` property of the `result` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `result` object, while this code fragment only returns the `value` property of the `result` object after it has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.catch(function (error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `result` object, while this code fragment only returns the `value` property of the `result` object after it has been resolved, and throws an error if the `result` object is rejected.

DONE.
