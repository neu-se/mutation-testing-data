  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the longitude values instead of calculating the difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the longitude values instead of calculating the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the longitude values instead of calculating the difference.

DONE.
