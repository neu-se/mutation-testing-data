  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['abs']` is a different property than `a['arg']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `b['arg']` is a different property than `a['arg']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents a different value than `a['arg']`.

DONE.
