  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sinh` to calculate the hyperbolic sine, while the mutated code uses `cosh` to calculate the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sinh` to calculate the hyperbolic sine, while the mutated code uses `tanh` to calculate the hyperbolic tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sinh` to calculate the hyperbolic sine, while the mutated code uses `coth` to calculate the hyperbolic cotangent.

DONE.
