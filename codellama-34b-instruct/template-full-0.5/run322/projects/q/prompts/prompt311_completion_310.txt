  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not being called with any arguments, so it would not be able to resolve or reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not being called with any arguments, so it would not be able to resolve or reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "Q"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not being called with any arguments, so it would not be able to resolve or reject the promise.

DONE.
