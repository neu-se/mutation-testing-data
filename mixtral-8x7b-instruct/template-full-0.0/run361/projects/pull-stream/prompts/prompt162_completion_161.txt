 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer return an error when there is no value to return, instead it would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would try to return the value that was passed to it, instead of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would pass the value to the callback function, instead of an error. This would also cause the function to behave differently if the value is not null or undefined.

DONE.
