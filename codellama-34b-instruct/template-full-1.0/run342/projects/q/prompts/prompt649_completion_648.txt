  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the HTTP method is changed from "POST" to "PUT", which can cause the server to interpret the request differently and potentially return a different response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are reversed, which could cause the server to interpret the request differently and potentially return a different response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "name" argument is removed, which could cause the server to interpret the request differently and potentially return a different response.

DONE.
