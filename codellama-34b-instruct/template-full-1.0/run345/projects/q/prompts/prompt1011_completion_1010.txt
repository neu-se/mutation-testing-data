  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var message = "Hello World!";
deferred.resolve(message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not have a variable `message` declared, and the `deferred.resolve` method is not called with any specific value, while this replacement code resolves the promise with a specific value, which may change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not have an error handling mechanism, while this replacement code explicitly rejects the promise with an error, which may change the way the program handles errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not use the `apply` method on the `deferred.makeNodeResolver` function, while this replacement code does, which may change the
