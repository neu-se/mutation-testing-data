  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and start with the second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start with the first argument and skip all the others, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start with the last argument and skip all the others, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
