  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the original `item` onto the array, while this mutant pushes `item + 1` onto the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + arr.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the original `item` onto the array, while this mutant pushes `item + arr.length` onto the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the original `item` onto the array, while this mutant pushes the first element of `item` onto the array.

DONE.
