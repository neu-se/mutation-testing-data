  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of π is used instead of the function `deg2rad`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of π/2 is used instead of the function `deg2rad`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of 2π is used instead of the function `deg2rad`.

DONE.
