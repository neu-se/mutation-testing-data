  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.prise
```
This would result in different behavior because "prise" is not a valid method for the URL object, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is set to `false`, which would cause the parser to ignore the second argument and use the default value of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(result_normalize_options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument is set to `result_normalize_options`, which is an object that contains options for normalizing URLs, rather than a string containing the URL to be parsed.

DONE.
