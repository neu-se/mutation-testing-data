  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the `baseUrlStr` has illegal characters, but this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`, which may not be the case if the function returns a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `baseUrlStr` has illegal characters, but this new code fragment checks if it does not have illegal characters, which may not be the case if the function returns a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `baseUrlStr` has illegal characters, but this new code fragment checks if it
