  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is an empty array, but this replacement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `for` loop to never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is an empty array, but this replacement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `for` loop to always execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cbs` is an empty array, but this replacement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `for` loop to never execute.

DONE.
