  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the second part, `b == 0`, if `this['isZero']` were `true`, while the original code fragment would execute it regardless.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of `this['isZero']`, causing the code to behave differently for different inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `b` as an argument to `this['isZero']`, which would cause the function to behave differently for different inputs.

DONE.
