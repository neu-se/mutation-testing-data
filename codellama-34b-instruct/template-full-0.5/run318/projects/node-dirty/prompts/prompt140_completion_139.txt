  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `_emit` is a different method than `emit`, and it may not have the same side effects or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a different `this` context, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the `this` context of the function to `null`, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
