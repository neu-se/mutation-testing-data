  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the generator tries to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and it would cause a `TypeError` when the generator tries to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and it would cause a `TypeError` when the generator tries to call it.

DONE.
