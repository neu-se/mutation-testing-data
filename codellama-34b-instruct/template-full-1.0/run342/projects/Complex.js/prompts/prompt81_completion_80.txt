```
c === ' -'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code treated the minus sign as a separate token, while this code fragment treats it as part of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code treated the minus sign as a separate token, while this code fragment treats it as part of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' - '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code treated the minus sign as a separate token, while this code fragment treats it as part of the number.

DONE.
