  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the EOL constant, which is a newline character, to separate the lines in the stringified object. Replacing it with a space character would cause the lines to be separated by a space instead, which could cause issues if the string is later parsed or processed in a way that relies on the newline characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the EOL constant, which is a newline character, to separate the lines in the stringified object. Replacing it with a backslash and the letter "n" would cause the lines to be separated by a backslash and the letter "n" instead, which could cause issues if the string is later parsed or processed in a way that relies on the newline characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\r\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because
