  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `reason`, which could cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the promise fulfill with a value of `null`, rather than the original value of `reason`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the promise fulfill with a value of `undefined`, rather than the original value of `reason`.

DONE.
