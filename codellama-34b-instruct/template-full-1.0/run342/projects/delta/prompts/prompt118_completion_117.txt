  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an op would be increased by 1, which could cause an off-by-one error in certain operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an op would be decreased by 1, which could cause an off-by-one error in certain operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of an op would be multiplied by 10, which could cause an overflow in certain operations.

DONE.
