  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from `word`. This could potentially change the output of the `plural` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the case of `word`, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase` method to convert `word` to upper case. This could potentially change the output of the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.concat('s')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends the string 's' to `word` using the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `concat` method to concatenate the string 's' to `word`. This could potentially change the output of the `pl
