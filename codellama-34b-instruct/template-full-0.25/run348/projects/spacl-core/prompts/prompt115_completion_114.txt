  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `verbs` is the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.concat()` creates a new array, whereas `verbs` is the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(v => v !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.filter(v => v !== 'GET')` filters out the verb 'GET' from the array, whereas `verbs` is the original array.

DONE.
