  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be initialized to `1` instead of `0`, which could lead to off-by-one errors in the for loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be initialized to `-1` instead of `0`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the for loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var j = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `j` would be initialized to `0` instead of `i`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the for loop.

DONE.
