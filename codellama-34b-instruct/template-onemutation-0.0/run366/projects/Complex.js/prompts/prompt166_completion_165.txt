  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isZero']()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero, but the replaced code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is not zero. This change would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this` is infinite and `z` is not zero, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
