  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` property is not defined in the `options` object, so the `JSON.parse` method will use the default reviver function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` property is defined in the `options` object, so the `JSON.parse` method will use the custom reviver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver || (() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.reviver` property is defined in the `options` object, so the `JSON.parse` method will use the custom reviver function. However, the custom reviver function is an empty function, so it will not modify the parsed JSON object.
