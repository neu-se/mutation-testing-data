  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to `makeNodeResolver`, but this code fragment passes `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to `makeNodeResolver`, but this code fragment passes `undefined` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment did not pass any arguments to `makeNodeResolver`, but this code fragment passes a placeholder argument.

DONE.
