  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` would create a new promise that would be resolved with the value, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the deferred promise with the value directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(value)` would create a new promise that would be resolved with the value, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the deferred promise with the value directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject(value)` would create a new promise that would be rejected with the value, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the deferred promise with the value directly.

DONE.
