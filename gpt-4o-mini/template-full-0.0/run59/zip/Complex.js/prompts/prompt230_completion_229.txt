Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of the imaginary part `b` instead of the absolute value of the complex number, which could lead to incorrect results when `b` is negative or when `a` is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the imaginary part `b` instead of calculating the absolute value, which would yield incorrect results in the context of calculating the square root of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) + Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sums the absolute values of the real part `a` and the imaginary part `b`, rather than calculating the overall magnitude of the complex number, which could lead to incorrect results in the square root calculation.

DONE.
