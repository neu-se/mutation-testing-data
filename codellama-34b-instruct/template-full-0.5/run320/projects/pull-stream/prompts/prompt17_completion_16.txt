  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `pull` function with a single argument, while this replacement uses the `pull` function with multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `pull` function with a single argument, while this replacement uses the `pull` function with multiple arguments, including an additional argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4], ref[5])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `pull` function with a single argument, while this replacement uses the `pull` function with multiple arguments, including additional arguments
