  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This change will cause the `continuer` function to throw an error instead of returning a value, which will result in the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This change will cause the `continuer` function to return a value instead of throwing an error, which will result in the promise being fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "next"
```
This change will cause the `continuer` function to return a value instead of throwing an error, which will result in the promise being fulfilled.

DONE.
