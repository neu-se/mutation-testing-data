Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop by repeatedly calling `nextStream` without handling the abort condition, leading to a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly signal the callback with a `true` value, which may not be handled properly by the calling function, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the stream processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(false, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `false` instead of `true`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the stream's abort state, potentially allowing data to be processed when it should not be.

DONE.
