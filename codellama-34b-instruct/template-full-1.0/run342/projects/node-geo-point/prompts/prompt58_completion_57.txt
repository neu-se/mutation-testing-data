  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because cos is the cosine function, which returns a different value than sin for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin^2
```
This would result in different behavior because sin^2 is the square of the sine function, which returns a different value than sin for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because tan is the tangent function, which returns a different value than sin for the same input.

DONE.
