  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, so it would not have the `postMessage` method, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, so it would not have the `postMessage` method, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object does not have the `postMessage` method, which would cause an error.

DONE.
