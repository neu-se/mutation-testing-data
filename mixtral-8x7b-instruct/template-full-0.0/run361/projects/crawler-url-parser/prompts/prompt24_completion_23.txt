 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the negated character set from `_has_illegal_chars` function, which is more restrictive than the original regex and may cause some valid URLs to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character after the '#' symbol, not just the ones that are not part of the URL. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing URLs with fragments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('[^a-z0-9\\:\\/\\?\\#\\[\\]\\@\\!\\$\\&\\'\\(\\)\\*\\+\\,\\;\\=\\.\\-_\\
