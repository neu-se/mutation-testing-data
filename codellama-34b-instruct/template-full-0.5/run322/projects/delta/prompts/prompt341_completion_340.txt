  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the iterator, which would advance the iterator and return the next element in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method is called on the iterator, which would return the next element in the sequence without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is called on the iterator, which would return a boolean value indicating whether there are more elements in the sequence.

DONE.
