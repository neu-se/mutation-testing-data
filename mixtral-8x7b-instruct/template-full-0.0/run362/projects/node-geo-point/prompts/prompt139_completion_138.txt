 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.round(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjusted latitude would keep its original precision, while the longitude would be rounded to the nearest integer, which is not consistent with the original behavior of keeping the same precision for both latitude and longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.longitude * precision
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be multiplied by the precision, instead of adjusting the precision of the longitude value. This would lead to significantly different values for the adjusted longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.altitude || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjustPrecision` method is only designed to handle latitude and longitude. Introducing `this.altitude` would cause the method to return a `GeoPoint` with an altitude, even if the
