  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function expects an array of arguments, but `null` is not an array and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function expects an array of arguments, but `[]` is an empty array and would not provide any arguments to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfcall` function expects an array of arguments, but `[1, 2, 3]` is an array of numbers and would not be a valid set of arguments for the callback function.

DONE.
