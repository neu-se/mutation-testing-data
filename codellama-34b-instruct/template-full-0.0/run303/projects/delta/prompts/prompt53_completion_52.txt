  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this code checks if it is not a function.

DONE.
