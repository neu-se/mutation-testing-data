  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the text is not included in the `tmpUrl.text`, while this replacement checks if the text is included in the `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the text is not included in the `tmpUrl.text`, while this replacement checks if the text is not included at the beginning of the `tmpUrl.text`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.lastIndexOf(text) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the text is not included in the `tmpUrl.text`, while this replacement checks if the text is not included at the end of the `tmpUrl.text`.

DONE.
