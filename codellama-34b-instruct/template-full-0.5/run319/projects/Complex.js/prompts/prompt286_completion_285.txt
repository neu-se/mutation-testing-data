  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator changes the sign of the value, which would affect the calculation of the complex exponential.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is increased by 1, which would affect the calculation of the complex exponential.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is multiplied by 2, which would affect the calculation of the complex exponential.

DONE.
