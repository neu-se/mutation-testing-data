  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function, causing the code to execute the `return null` statement if the `currentUrlStr` does not contain any illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the code to execute the `return null` statement regardless of the result of the `_has_illegal_chars` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr) && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the code to execute
