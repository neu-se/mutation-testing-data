  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry({})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new, empty country object, rather than using the country data from the imported JSON file. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return an empty object, instead of the country object returned by the original `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry({ name: "InvalidCountry" })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new country object with an invalid name, rather than using the country data from the imported JSON file. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null`, instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `buildCountry` function to return `null`, rather than the expected country object. This would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null`, instead of the expected country object.
