  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is a space or a number, while the new code fragment checks if the next token is a space and if the number is not a NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && tokens[i + 1] !== '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is a space or a number, while the new code fragment checks if the next token is a space and if the number is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && tokens[i + 1] !== '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is a space or
