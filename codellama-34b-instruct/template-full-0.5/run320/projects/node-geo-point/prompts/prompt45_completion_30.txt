  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 0 ? 1 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `> 0` check would cause the function to return 1 for any positive value of `r`, rather than only for values greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 2 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because the `> 1` check would cause the function to return 2 for any value of `r` greater than 1, rather than only for values greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 0 ? r : 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `> 0` check would cause the function to return the value of `r` for any positive value of `r`, rather than only for values greater than 1.

DONE.
