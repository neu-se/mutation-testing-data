  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the destination point would be incorrect, as the sum of the coordinates would not be a valid coordinate pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the destination point would be incorrect, as the product of the coordinates would not be a valid coordinate pair.

DONE.
