  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the `get` method to fail with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve(error)` would resolve the promise with an error, which would cause the `get` method to return the error instead of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve("error")` would resolve the promise with a string "error" instead of an error object, which would cause the `get` method to return the string "error" instead of the value.

DONE.
