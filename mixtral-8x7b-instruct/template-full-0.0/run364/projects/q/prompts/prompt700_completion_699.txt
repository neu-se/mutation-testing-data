 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array each time, while `args.concat` uses the existing array and appends the new elements to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new array, while `concat` modifies the existing array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.concat.apply([], args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method to spread the `args` array as separate arguments, which could lead to different behavior in some cases.

DONE.
