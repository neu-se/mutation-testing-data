  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove one more character from the end of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add one more character to the end of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the word, resulting in a different plural form.

DONE.
