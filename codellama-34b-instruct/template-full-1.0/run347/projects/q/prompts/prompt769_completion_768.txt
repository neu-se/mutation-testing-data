  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise for an array of states, while `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` waits for the first resolved promise, while `allResolved` waits for all promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` waits for all promises to be resolved, while `allResolved` waits for all promises to settle.

DONE.
