  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` are different arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejectedPromises
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejectedPromises` is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is a different array than `unhandledRejections `.

DONE.
