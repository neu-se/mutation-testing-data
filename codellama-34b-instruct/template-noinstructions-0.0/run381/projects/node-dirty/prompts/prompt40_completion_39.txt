  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is not called, and the `forEach` method would not iterate over the keys in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, and the `forEach` method would not iterate over the keys in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fn` function is called with the wrong number of arguments, and the `this` context is not passed to the function.

DONE.
