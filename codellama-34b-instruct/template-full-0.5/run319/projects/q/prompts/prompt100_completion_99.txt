  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be true, regardless of whether the index exists in the array or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always be false, regardless of whether the index exists in the array or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be true if the index exists in the array and false if it does not, which is the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
