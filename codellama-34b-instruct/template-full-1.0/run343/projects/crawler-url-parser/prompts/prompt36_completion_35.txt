  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value would make the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement not execute, potentially leaving the URL hash in the parsed URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would make the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement not execute, potentially leaving the URL hash in the parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` value would make the `delete parsedUrl.hash` statement execute, potentially removing the URL hash from the parsed URL object.

DONE.
