  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key];
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value would be swapped, causing the data to be stored in the database with the wrong key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, undefined];
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be set to undefined, causing the data to be deleted from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, key];
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be set to the same as the key, causing the data to be stored in the database with the wrong value.

DONE.
