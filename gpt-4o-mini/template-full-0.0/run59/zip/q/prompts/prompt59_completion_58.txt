Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof document === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `document` object instead of the `window` object, which would be true in environments like Node.js where `document` is not defined, leading to the `requestTick` function being set incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `window` is an object rather than checking if it is defined. In some environments, `window` could be defined but not be an object (e.g., if it is overridden), which would change the logic flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof global !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `global` object, which is specific to Node.js environments. If `global` is defined, it would incorrectly assume that the code is running in a Node.js environment, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in browser contexts.

DONE.
