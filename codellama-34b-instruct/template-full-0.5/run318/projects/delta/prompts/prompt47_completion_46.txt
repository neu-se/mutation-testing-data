  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not equal to `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `a` by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not equal to `b`.

DONE.
