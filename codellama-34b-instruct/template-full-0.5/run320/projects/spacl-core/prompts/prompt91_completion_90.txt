  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, so the `for...of` loop would iterate over a different array than the one used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== 'default')
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, it would filter out any policies with the name 'default'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, it would return an array of policy names.

DONE.
