  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname == linkurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the hostname portion of the URL only, rather than the entire host.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.href == linkurl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the full URL, including the protocol, hostname, and path, rather than just the host.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname == linkurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the path portion of the URL only, rather than the entire host.

DONE.
