  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is incorrect and there is no event listener attached to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"process.emit('unhandledRejection', reason, promise)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly call the `emit` method and `reason` and `promise` would be passed as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => { console.log(reason, promise) })"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a listener for the `unhandledRejection` event and log the `reason` and `promise` every time the event is emitted.

DONE.
