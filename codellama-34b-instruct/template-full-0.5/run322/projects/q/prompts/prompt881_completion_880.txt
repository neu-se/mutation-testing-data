  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would call `deferred.reject()` with the error as an argument, while this replacement code fragment would call `deferred.reject()` directly, which would result in the error being passed as the value of the promise, rather than being passed as an argument to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that would call `deferred.resolve()` with the value as an argument, while this replacement code fragment would call `deferred.resolve()` directly, which would result in the value being passed as the value of the promise, rather than being passed as an argument to the callback function.
