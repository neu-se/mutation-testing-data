  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code iterate over the previous element instead of the current one, potentially skipping some elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code iterate over the previous element instead of the current one, potentially skipping some elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = thisIter.next();
if (nextOp.retain) {
  const newOp: Op = {
    retain: typeof nextOp.retain === 'number' ? nextOp.retain : nextOp.retain.retain,
  };
  retDelta.push(newOp);
} else if (nextOp.delete) {
  retDelta.push(nextOp);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the code create a new `
