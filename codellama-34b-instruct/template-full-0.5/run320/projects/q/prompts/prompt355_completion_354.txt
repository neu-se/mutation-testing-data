  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the original exception as its message, rather than using the original exception object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw the original exception object directly, rather than creating a new error object with the exception as its message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the original exception object directly, rather than creating a new error object with the exception as its message.

DONE.
