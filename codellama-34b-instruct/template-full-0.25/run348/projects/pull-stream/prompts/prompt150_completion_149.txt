  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, which means that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `if` statement, so the expression would be evaluated as `(abort && value) != null`, which would always be `false` if `value` is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, not identity, so the expression would be evaluated as `value == null`, which would be `true` if `value` is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
