  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.resolve(promises)` only when `pendingCount` is 0, but this code would resolve the promise unconditionally, potentially causing the promise to be resolved before all promises in the array have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.reject(promises)` only when `pendingCount` is 0, but this code would reject the promise unconditionally, potentially causing the promise to be rejected before all promises in the array have been rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: promises });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.notify({ index: index, value: promises })` only when `pendingCount`
