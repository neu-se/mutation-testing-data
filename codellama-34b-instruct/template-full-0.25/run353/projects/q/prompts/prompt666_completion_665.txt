  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1`, which is a constant value, while `1 + 1` is an expression that evaluates to `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1`, which is a number, while `"hello"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1`, which is a defined value, while `undefined` is an undefined value.

DONE.
