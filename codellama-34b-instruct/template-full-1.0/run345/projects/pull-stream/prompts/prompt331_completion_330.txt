  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none()
```
This would result in different behavior because `none()` is not a defined function, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data, 'abort')
```
This would result in different behavior because `op(data, 'abort')` is a different call than what is currently in the code, and it would cause the `op` function to be applied to the `data` argument as well as the string `'abort'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `onEnd` to be called with two arguments, `null` and `abort`, instead of just `abort` as currently.

DONE.
