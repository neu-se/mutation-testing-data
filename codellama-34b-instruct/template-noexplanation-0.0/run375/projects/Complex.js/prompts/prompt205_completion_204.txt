  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This will cause the `pow` function to return a different result, as the `atan2` function will be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + 1
```
This will cause the `pow` function to return a different result, as the `exp` function will be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This will cause the `pow` function to return a different result, as the `atan2` function will be called with a different argument.

DONE.
