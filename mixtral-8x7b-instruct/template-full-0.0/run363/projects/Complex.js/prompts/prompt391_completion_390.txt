 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a real number (1) instead of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the real part of the complex number, ignoring the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the sine function instead of the cosine function, which would change the result significantly.

DONE.
