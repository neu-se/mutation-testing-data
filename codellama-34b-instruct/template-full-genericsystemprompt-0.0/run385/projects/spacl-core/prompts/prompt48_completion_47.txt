  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire part string to the props array, instead of just the part after the colon.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1).toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string to the props array in lowercase, instead of the original case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part.slice(1).replace(/[A-Z]/g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the part string to the props array with all uppercase letters removed, instead of the original case.

DONE.
