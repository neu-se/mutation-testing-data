  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `nodeback` argument is not a function, while this new code fragment would throw an error regardless of the type of `nodeback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error when the `nodeback` argument is not a function, while this new code fragment would call the `nodeback` function with `error` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error when the `nodeback` argument is not a function, while this new code fragment would call the `nodeback` function with `error` as the first argument and `undefined` as the second argument.

DONE.
