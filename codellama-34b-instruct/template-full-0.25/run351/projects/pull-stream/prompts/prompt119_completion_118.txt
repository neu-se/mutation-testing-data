  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which could cause the program to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which could cause the program to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, which could cause the program to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
