  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator will return `currentUrl` if it is truthy, and `currentUrl.url` if `currentUrl` is falsy. In the original code, the `&&` operator is used, which will return `currentUrl.url` if `currentUrl` is truthy, and `undefined` if `currentUrl` is falsy.

DONE.
