  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be decremented by the `length` of the operation, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over the current line and move to the previous line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be incremented by the `length` of the operation plus one, which would cause the `eachLine` method to move to the next line and skip over the current line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be incremented by the `length` of the operation multiplied by two, which would cause the `eachLine` method to move to the next line and then back to the current line, effectively skipping over the current line.

DONE.
