 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `push` method to add `newOp` to the `ops` array regardless of the previous `lastOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `push` method to add `newOp` to the `ops` array regardless of the previous `lastOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
