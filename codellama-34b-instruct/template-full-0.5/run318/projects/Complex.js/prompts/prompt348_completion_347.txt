  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the negative of a complex number is still a complex number. However, the new code fragment uses the unary minus operator on `b`, which is a real number, and the result of this operation is a real number, not a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the sum of a complex number and a real number is still a complex number. However, the new code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a real number, and the sum of a real number and a real number is still a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `b` variable, which is
