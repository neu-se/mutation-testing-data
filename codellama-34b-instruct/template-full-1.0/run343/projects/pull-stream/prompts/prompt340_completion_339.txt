  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` function is called with a different argument, which may produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` property is accessed directly on the `data` object, instead of being called as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` object is passed as the argument to the `field` function, whereas the original code passed the result of `field(data)` as the argument to the `filter` function.

DONE.
