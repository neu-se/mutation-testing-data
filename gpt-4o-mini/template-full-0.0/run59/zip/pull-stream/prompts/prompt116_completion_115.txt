Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the error instead of the actual error object, potentially leading to incorrect handling of errors in the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the accumulator instead of the actual accumulated value, which could cause the callback to behave incorrectly when trying to access the accumulated result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Custom error'), acc
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original error with a new custom error object, which may not accurately represent the original error context, leading to misleading error handling in the callback.

DONE.
