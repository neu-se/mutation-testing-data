  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(.+?)e[+-]?(\d+)|^(.+?)(\d+)|^(.+?)(\.\d+)|^(.+?)($)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex uses a lazy quantifier `+?` in the first and third alternations, which matches as few digits as possible, while the new regex uses a greedy quantifier `+` in the first and third alternations, which matches as many digits as possible. This would change the behavior of the regex in the case when the input string has more than one exponential number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(.+?)e[+-]?(\d+)|^(.+?)(\d+)|^(.+?)(\.\d+)|^(.+?)($)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex is case-sensitive, while the new regex is case-insensitive. This would affect the matching behavior of the regex in the case when the
