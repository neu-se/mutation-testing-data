  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` would return a substring starting from the specified index (1), whereas `slice` would return a substring starting from the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(0, part.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` would return a substring ending at the specified index (0), whereas `slice` would return a substring starting from the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring(part.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` would return a substring starting from the specified index (0), whereas `slice` would return a substring starting from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
