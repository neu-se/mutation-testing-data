  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0] !== word
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the word matches the rule, while this new fragment checks if the word does not match the rule. This would cause the plural function to return a different result for words that should not be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].length === word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the word matches the rule, while this new fragment checks if the word has the same length as the rule. This would cause the plural function to return a different result for words that have the same length as the rule but are not the same word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'String' && rule[0].toLowerCase() === word.toLowerCase()
```
