  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `length` parameter, which would cause the `next()` method to return the next `length` characters in the iterator, rather than the entire remaining string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `length` parameter, which would cause the `next()` method to return the next `length` characters in the iterator, rather than the entire remaining string.
