  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the `read` variable, which would change the value of the variable and potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the `read` variable, which would also change the value of the variable and potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the `read` variable by 2, which would change the value of the variable and potentially cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
