Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` changes the context in which the function is called, potentially leading to different behavior in how `this` is handled within the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing the `arguments` object directly instead of using `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would include the first argument in the array, altering the expected parameters for the function being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of the sliced arguments means that the function will be called with no arguments, which could lead to unexpected results if the function expects certain parameters.

DONE.
