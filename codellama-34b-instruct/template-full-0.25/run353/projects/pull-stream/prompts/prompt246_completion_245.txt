  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expected to be called with an error object or `null`, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to be called with no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expected to be called with an error object or `null`, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to be called with no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is expected to be called with an error object or `null`, but replacing it with an empty object would cause the function to be called with a non-null value, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
