  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment first adds 360 to θ, then takes the remainder of the result when divided by 360. The new code fragment, on the other hand, takes the remainder of θ plus 360 directly, which could result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment first adds 360 to θ, then takes the remainder of the result when divided by 360. The new code fragment, on the other hand, takes the remainder of θ plus 180 directly, which could result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 90) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
