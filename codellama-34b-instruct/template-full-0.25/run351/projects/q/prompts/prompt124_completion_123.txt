  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the "prototype" property from the keys array, which could cause issues if the "prototype" property is being used or referenced in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || key === "prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the "prototype" property in the keys array, which could cause issues if the "prototype" property is not being used or referenced in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && key !== "length"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the "length" property from the keys array, which could cause issues if the "length" property is being used or referenced in the code.

DONE.
