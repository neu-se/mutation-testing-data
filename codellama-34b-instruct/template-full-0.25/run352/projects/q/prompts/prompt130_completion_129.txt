  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property with the given key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the key plus one, rather than the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the key in uppercase, rather than the key itself.

DONE.
