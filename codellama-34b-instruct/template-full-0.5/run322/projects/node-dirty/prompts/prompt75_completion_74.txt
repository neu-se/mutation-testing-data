  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be replaced with the `error` event, which would cause the code to emit an error event instead of the `load` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be replaced with the `drain` event, which would cause the code to emit a `drain` event instead of the `load` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be replaced with the `close` event, which would cause the code to emit a `close` event instead of the `load` event.

DONE.
