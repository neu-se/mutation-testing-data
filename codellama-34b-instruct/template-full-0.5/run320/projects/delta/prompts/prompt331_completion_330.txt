  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.insert` is a different object than `baseOp`, and it may have different properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.length` is a different value than `baseOp`, and it may affect the behavior of the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOp.attributes` is a different object than `baseOp`, and it may have different properties or methods.

DONE.
