 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be changed to a rejected value, potentially causing the promise chain to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be sent as a progress notification instead of a resolved value, potentially causing the promise chain to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { /* do nothing */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value would be completely ignored, potentially causing the promise chain to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
