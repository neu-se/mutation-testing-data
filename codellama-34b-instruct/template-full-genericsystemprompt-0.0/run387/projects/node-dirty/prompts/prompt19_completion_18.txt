  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[]` array would always be empty, even if the `cbs` array has values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used as the callback function, even if the `cbs` array has values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be used as the callback function, even if the `cbs` array has values.

DONE.
