  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the third argument instead of the second, potentially changing the values passed to the `post` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only take the first two arguments instead of all the arguments, potentially changing the values passed to the `post` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would take all the arguments except the last one, potentially changing the values passed to the `post` method.

DONE.
