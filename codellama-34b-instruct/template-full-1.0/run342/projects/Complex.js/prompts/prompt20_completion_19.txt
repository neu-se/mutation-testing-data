  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 3000 || b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `||` instead of `&&` would cause the function to return a different value for larger arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the product of the arguments would be checked against 3000 instead of each argument individually.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a) < 30 || Math.sqrt(b) < 30
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of each argument is being checked against 30 instead of the arguments themselves.

DONE.
