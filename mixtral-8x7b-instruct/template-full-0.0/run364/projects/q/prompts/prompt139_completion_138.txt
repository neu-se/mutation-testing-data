 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = promise.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the `source` property of the `promise` object to the `p` variable, instead of the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = promise.constructor.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the prototype of the `promise` constructor to the `p` variable, instead of the `promise` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = promise.constructor
