  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than operator, while this replacement uses the greater than or equal to operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than zero, while this replacement checks if `b` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is less than zero, while this replacement uses the `not` keyword to check if `b` is truthy.

DONE.
