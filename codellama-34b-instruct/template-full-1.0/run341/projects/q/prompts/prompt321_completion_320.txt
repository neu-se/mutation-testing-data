  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `undefined`:
```
var promise = object_create(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function would return an object with the prototype of `undefined`, which is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `null`:
```
var promise = object_create(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function would return an object with the prototype of `null`, which is not a function and cannot be called.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with `Q.resolve()`:
```
var promise = object_create(Q.resolve());
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, which is not a function and cannot be called.

DONE.
