  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `arguments` object, while the modified code fragment returns the first element of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `arguments` object, while the modified code fragment returns the second element of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `arguments` object, while the modified code fragment returns the third element of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
