 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `new URL` creates a `URL` object, while `URL.parse` returns a parsed object. This could lead to differences in behavior when accessing properties or methods of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('url').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly requires the `url` module and calls the `parse` function, while the original code uses the `URL` object which may have different behavior due to differences in the implementation of the `url` module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `URL` object on the `global` object, which may not be the same as the `URL` object used in the original code. This could lead to differences in behavior when accessing properties or methods of the object
