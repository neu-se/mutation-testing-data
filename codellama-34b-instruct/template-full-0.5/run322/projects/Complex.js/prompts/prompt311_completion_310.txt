  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would flip the sign of the result, causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would return a different value than the cosine function, causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the tangent function would return a different value than the cosine function, causing the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
