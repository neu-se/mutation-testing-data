  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the `unhandledRejections` array to 0, instead of removing the specified element from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the `unhandledReasons` array to 0, instead of removing the specified element from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to 0, instead of removing the specified element from the array.

DONE.
