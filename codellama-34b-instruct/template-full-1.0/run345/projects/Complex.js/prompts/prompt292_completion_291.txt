  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a constant value, but the modified code fragment has a variable value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a single variable, but the modified code fragment has two variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has no multiplication, but the modified code fragment has multiplication.

DONE.
