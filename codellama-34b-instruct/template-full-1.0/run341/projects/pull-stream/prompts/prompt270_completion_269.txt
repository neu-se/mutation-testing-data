  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!stream || 'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stream is falsy or if it is an object, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'object' !== typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the stream is an object, regardless of its falsy or truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'object' !== typeof stream && stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stream is an object and if it is truthy, which is a combination of the checks in the original code fragment.

DONE.
