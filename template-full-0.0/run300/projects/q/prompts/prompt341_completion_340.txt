  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a different variable than `defer`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a different object than `defer`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a different function than `defer`, and it is not clear what the intended behavior of the code is.

DONE.
