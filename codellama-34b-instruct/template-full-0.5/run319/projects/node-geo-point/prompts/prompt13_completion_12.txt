  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with only one element, which is not a valid geographic coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with any number of elements, not just two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for a non-array object with a length of 2, which is not a valid geographic coordinate.

DONE.
