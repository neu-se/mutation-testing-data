  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager" + ".com.au";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append ".com.au" to the parsed URL, potentially leading to a different domain being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager".split("").reverse().join("");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the characters in the URL, potentially leading to a different domain being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-window-manager".toUpperCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would uppercase the URL, potentially leading to a different domain being extracted.

DONE.
