  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles the rejection of the promise, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that handles the fulfillment of the promise, whereas `_progressed` is a function that handles the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("test"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that handles the rejection of the promise, and passing an error to it would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
