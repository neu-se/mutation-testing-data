  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called on the `rule` object, which would create a new instance of the `rule` object, rather than returning the original instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with the `deep` parameter set to `true`, which would create a deep copy of the `rule` object, rather than a shallow copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with the `deep` parameter set to `false`, which would create a shallow copy of the `rule` object, rather than a deep copy.

DONE.
