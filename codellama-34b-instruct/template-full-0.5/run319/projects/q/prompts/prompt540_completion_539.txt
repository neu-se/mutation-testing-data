  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` are different methods of the `Function` object, and they have different effects on the `this` context and the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that, when called, will have a specific `this` context and arguments, whereas `apply` and `call` simply call the function with the specified context and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a different function than `fulfilled`, and it would have a different effect on the promise chain.

DONE.
