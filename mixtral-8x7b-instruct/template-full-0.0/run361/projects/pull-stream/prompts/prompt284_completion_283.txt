 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Intentionally inserted error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object with a specific message, whereas the original code simply passes the `err` object without modification. This change could expose tests that do not handle errors correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the error object with a null value. This could expose tests that do not handle the absence of an error object correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the error object with an empty object. This could expose tests that do not handle unexpected object types correctly.

These mutations would help to ensure that the test suite accounts for different types of errors and unexpected values, making it more robust and effective.

DONE.
