  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash and is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash and is not equal to itself.

DONE.
