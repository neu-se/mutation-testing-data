  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && 1 == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `1 == 0` would always evaluate to `false`, causing the entire expression to evaluate to `false` even if `define` is a function and `define['amd']` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && typeof exports === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `typeof exports === 'object'` would only be `true` if `exports` is an object, which is not always the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && typeof module === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `typeof module === 'object'` would only be `true` if `module` is an object, which is not always the case.
