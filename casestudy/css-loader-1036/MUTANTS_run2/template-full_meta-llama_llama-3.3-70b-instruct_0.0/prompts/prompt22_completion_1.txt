Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${source} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `cssMapping.sourceRoot` prefix from the source URL, potentially changing how the source map is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(source) => `/*# sourceURL=${cssMapping.sources[0]} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the first source in the `cssMapping.sources` array instead of the current source, potentially causing incorrect source mapping.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => `/*# sourceURL=${cssMapping.sourceRoot} */`
```
This would result in different behavior because it ignores the current source and always uses the `cssMapping.sourceRoot` as the source URL, potentially causing incorrect source mapping.

DONE.
