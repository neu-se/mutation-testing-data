  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would pass the original `data` value to the callback function, while the new code fragment `data = null` would pass `null` to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would execute the callback function with the original value of `a`, while the new code fragment `a = true` would execute the callback function with `a` set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would execute the callback function with the original value of `read`, while the new code fragment `read = null` would execute the callback function with `read` set to `null`.

DONE.
