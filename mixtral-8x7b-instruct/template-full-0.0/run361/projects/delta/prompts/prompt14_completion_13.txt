 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the number of keys in `a` instead of the resulting `attributes` object. This might cause the function to return `undefined` even if there are keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes || undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `undefined` if `attributes` is falsy, even if there are keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign({}, attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the same keys and values as `attributes`, but it doesn't check if there are any keys before returning it. This might cause the function to return an empty object even if there are no keys in the `attributes` object.
