  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is passed as an argument to the `dispatch` method, which would result in a dispatch to the current object. With `undefined`, no dispatch would be made.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is passed as an argument to the `dispatch` method, which would result in a dispatch to the current object. With `this`, the dispatch would be made to the object that the `fbound` function was called on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `object` is passed as an argument to the `dispatch` method, which would result in a dispatch to the current object. With `null`, the dispatch would be made to the global object.

DONE.
