  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to iterate more times than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement instead of incrementing, potentially causing the loop to never iterate or to iterate forever.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would reset the counter to 0 on each iteration, potentially causing the loop to iterate indefinitely or to stop prematurely.

DONE.
