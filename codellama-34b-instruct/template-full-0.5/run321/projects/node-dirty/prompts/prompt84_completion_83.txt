  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a newline character to separate the data in the database, while the new code uses a tab character. This could cause the data to be parsed incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values being stored or retrieved from the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a newline character to separate the data in the database, while the new code uses an empty string. This could cause the data to be parsed incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values being stored or retrieved from the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a newline character to separate the data in the database, while the new code uses a space character. This could cause the data to be parsed incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values being stored or retrieved from the database.

DONE.
