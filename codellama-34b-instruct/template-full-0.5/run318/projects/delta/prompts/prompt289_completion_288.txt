  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to skip over the next two elements in the iterator, rather than just the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to move backward by one element, rather than forward.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to move to the next element with the key 'foo', rather than just the next element.

DONE.
