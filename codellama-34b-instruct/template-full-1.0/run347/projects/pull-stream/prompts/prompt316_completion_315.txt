  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `terminate(null)` will call the `terminate` function with `null` as the first argument, which may have different effects than passing `ended` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `terminate(false)` will call the `terminate` function with `false` as the first argument, which may have different effects than passing `ended` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `terminate(undefined)` will call the `terminate` function with `undefined` as the first argument, which may have different effects than passing `ended` as in the original code.

DONE.
