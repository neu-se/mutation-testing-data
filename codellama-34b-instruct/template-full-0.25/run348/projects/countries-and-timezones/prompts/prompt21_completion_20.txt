  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(tz.d) ? tz.d : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` if `tz.d` is not an integer, whereas the original code would return `utcOffset` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(tz.d) ? tz.d : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` if `tz.d` is not an integer, whereas the original code would return `utcOffset` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(tz.d) ? tz.d : NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `NaN` if `tz.d` is not an integer, whereas the original code would return `utcOffset` in that case.

DONE.
