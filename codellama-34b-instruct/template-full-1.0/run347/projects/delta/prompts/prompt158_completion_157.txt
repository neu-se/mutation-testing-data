  Sure, here are my suggested code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to never evaluate to `true` and the `forEach` loop to never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `forEach` loop to always execute, regardless of the actual type of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to never evaluate to `true` and the `forEach` loop to never execute.

DONE.
