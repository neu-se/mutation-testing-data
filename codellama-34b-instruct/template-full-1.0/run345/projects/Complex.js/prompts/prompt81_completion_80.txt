  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, whereas the `!=` operator checks for strict inequality, including type differences. This means that `c !== '+'` would return `true` for cases where `c` is a different type, such as a number or an object, in addition to cases where `c` is not equal to `'+'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for less-than, whereas the `>` operator checks for greater-than. This means that `c < '0'` would return `true` for cases where `c` is less than `'0'` in terms of ASCII ordering, which would include negative numbers and letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, whereas the `==
