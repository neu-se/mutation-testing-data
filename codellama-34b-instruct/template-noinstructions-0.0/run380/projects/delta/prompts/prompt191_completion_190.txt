  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be overwritten with the value of `otherOp.retain`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be overwritten with the value of `thisOp.retain`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of `newOp` would be set to `null`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
