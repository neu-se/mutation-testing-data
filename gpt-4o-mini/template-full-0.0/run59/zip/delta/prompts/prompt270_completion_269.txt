Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `retDelta` without calling the `chop()` method, potentially leaving the delta unoptimized and including unnecessary operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return retDelta.chop(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `chop()` with a parameter of `true`, which may alter the behavior of the `chop()` method if it is designed to handle the boolean argument differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new empty `Delta` object instead of the processed `retDelta`, effectively discarding all the operations that were computed in the `diff` method.

DONE.
