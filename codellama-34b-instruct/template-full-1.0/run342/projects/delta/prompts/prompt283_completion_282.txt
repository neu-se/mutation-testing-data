  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
insert.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for a character within a string, rather than the index of a substring within a string.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would look for a character within a string, rather than the index of a substring within a string.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of a string, rather than the index of a substring within a string.

DONE.
