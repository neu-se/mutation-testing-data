  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is removed, which means that the regular expression will no longer match words that end with "ics" regardless of the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, which means that the regular expression will match all occurrences of "ics" in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression is added, which means that the regular expression will match words that end with "ics" regardless of the case.

DONE.
