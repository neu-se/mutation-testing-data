Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the URL from being parsed correctly, leading to potential errors or unexpected results when handling URLs that require parsing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the URL parsing to fail, resulting in an error or returning an invalid URL object, which would disrupt the flow of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would lead to the same outcome as the original code, but it could introduce ambiguity in the code logic, potentially causing issues in other parts of the application that rely on a defined boolean value.

DONE.
