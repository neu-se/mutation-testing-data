  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/akerix/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches a different set of words, including "appendix" and "index" with a "k" instead of a "c".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/akeyrix/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches a different set of words, including "appendix" and "index" with a "ky" instead of a "c".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ake(rix|ix)/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern matches
