  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `start` variable, which is not defined in the provided code snippet, while the replacement code fragment uses the `index` variable, which is defined in the `forEach` method. Using `start - index + 1` would result in a different value being passed to the `predicate` function, which could potentially cause the `forEach` method to behave differently.
