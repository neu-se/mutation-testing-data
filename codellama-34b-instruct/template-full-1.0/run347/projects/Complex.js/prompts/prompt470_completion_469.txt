  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b >= 1
```
This would result in a different behavior because `a + b` will never be negative, while the original code fragment will evaluate to `true` for negative values of `b` that are less than `-1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1 > a + b
```
This would result in a different behavior because the original code fragment will evaluate to `true` for any negative value of `b`, while the patched code will only evaluate to `true` for negative values of `b` that are greater than `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b < -1
```
This would result in a different behavior because the original code fragment will evaluate to `true` for any negative value of `b`, while the patched code will only evaluate to `true` for negative values of `b` that are less than `-1`.

DONE.
