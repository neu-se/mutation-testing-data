  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `process.emit` property is equal to the string `"function"`, which is not the same as checking if `process.emit` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `process.emit` property is undefined, which is not the same as checking if `process.emit` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `process.emit` property is not equal to the string `"function"`, which is not the same as checking if `process.emit` is a function.

DONE.
