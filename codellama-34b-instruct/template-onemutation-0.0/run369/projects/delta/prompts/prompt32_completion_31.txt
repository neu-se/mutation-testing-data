  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is an object, and `attr` is a property of `base`. In the original code, `attr` is being used as a key in the `baseInverted` object, but if we replace it with `base`, we would be using the entire `base` object as a key, which would likely cause errors.
