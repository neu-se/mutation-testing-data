  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a`, which is the real part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` separately, while the replaced code fragment adds them together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` and `b` separately, while the replaced code fragment multiplies them together.

DONE.
