  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+?\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` in the middle of the regex makes the `+` non-greedy, allowing it to match fewer characters. With the original code, the `+` is greedy and matches as many characters as possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^. +\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the space in the middle of the regex forces the `+` to match at least one space character, whereas the original regex allows any number of characters before the final `/`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^. +\\/\\$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `\\` in the middle of the regex escapes the `/` literal, allowing it to match a literal `/` character in the input string, whereas the original regex matches a literal `/` character.

DONE.
