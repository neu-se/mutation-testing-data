  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.insert` would add a new element to the beginning of the array, while `inverted.push` adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.unshift` adds a new element to the beginning of the array, while `inverted.push` adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inverted.pop()` removes the last element of the array, while `inverted.push` adds a new element to the end of the array.

DONE.
