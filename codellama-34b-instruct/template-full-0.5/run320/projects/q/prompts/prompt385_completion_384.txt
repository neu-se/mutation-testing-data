  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, which is different from the original behavior where the value of the resolved promise is the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, which is different from the original behavior where the value of the resolved promise is the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a rejected promise with an error message of "something went wrong", which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the original value.

DONE.
