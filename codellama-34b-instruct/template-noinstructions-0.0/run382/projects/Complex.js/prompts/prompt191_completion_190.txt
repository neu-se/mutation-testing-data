  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a function that calculates the logarithm of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number, while `Math.pow` is a function that calculates the power of a number.

DONE.
