  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` and `otherIter` are different iterators, and `peekLength` would return the length of the next operation in `thisIter`, which may not be the same as the next operation in `otherIter`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the next operation in `otherIter`, which may not be the same as the type of the next operation in `thisIter`.

DONE.
