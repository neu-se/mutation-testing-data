  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) * (minus % 2 ? -1 : 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `(minus % 2 ? -1 : 1)` would always result in a positive value, even if the token is a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) * (minus % 2 ? -1 : 1) + z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of `z['im']` would always result in a different value, even if the token is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) * (minus % 2 ? -1 : 1) - z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of `z['im']` would always result in a different value, even if
