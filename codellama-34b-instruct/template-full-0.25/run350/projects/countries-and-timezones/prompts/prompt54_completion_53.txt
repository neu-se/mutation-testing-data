  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(tz => tz.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the deprecated timezones, whereas the original code fragment returns all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(tz => tz.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone names, whereas the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reduce((acc, tz) => acc + tz.offset, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the total offset of all timezones, whereas the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values.

DONE.
