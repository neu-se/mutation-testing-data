  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diff(new Delta(["Hello"]), new Delta(["World"]), false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `diff` method, which would cause it to use a different delta value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diff(new Delta(), new Delta(), false);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `diff` method, which would cause it to use a different delta value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
diff(new Delta(["Hello"]), new Delta(["World"]), true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `diff` method, which would cause it to use a different delta value.

DONE.
