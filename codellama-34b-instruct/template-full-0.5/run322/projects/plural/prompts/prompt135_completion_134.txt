  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of the word's pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(0, -1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last letter of the word and add 'ies', regardless of the word's pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the last letter of the word with 'ies', regardless of the word's pluralization rules.

DONE.
