  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array.length` to determine the length of the array, while this replacement uses `array.length - 1`, which would result in the last element of the array being skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array[i++]` to access the elements of the array, while this replacement uses `array[0]`, which would always access the first element of the array, regardless of the value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `array[i++]` to access the elements of the array, while this replacement uses `array[i - 1]`, which would access the previous element of the array instead of the current element.

DONE.
