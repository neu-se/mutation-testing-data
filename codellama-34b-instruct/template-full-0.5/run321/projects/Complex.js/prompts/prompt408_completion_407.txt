  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `temp` variable, which is a complex number, while the new code fragment uses a different complex number, which may not have the same properties or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(temp.re, temp.im)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `temp` variable, which is a complex number, while the new code fragment creates a new complex number with the same real and imaginary parts, which may not have the same properties or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.ONE
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `temp` variable, which is a complex number, while the new code fragment uses the complex number one, which may not have the same properties or behavior.

DONE.
