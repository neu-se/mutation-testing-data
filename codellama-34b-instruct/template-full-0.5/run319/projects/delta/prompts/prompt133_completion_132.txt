  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be incremented by one, which would result in incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be decremented by one, which would result in incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be doubled, which would result in incorrect behavior in certain scenarios.

DONE.
