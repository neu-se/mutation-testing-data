  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would define a new property `__esModule` on the `Complex` object, which is not present in the original code. This could potentially cause issues with the code that uses the `Complex` object, as it may not be expecting this new property.

DONE.
