  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `domain`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` is not necessarily equal to `null`, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.exit` is not necessarily a function, and the code would throw an error if it is not.

DONE.
