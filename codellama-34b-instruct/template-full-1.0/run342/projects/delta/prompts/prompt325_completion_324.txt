  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be incremented by one, which would cause the `slice` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be decremented by one, which would cause the `slice` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseIndex` would be incremented by one, which would cause the `slice` function to return a different result.

DONE.
