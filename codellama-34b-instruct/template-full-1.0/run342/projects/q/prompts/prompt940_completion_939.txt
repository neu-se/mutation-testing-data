  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` method reverses the order of elements in an array, which would cause the arguments to be passed in a different order to the underlying function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` method removes the first element of an array, which would cause the first argument to be missing in the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).splice(1, 0, "foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` method adds an element to an array at a specified index, which would cause an extra argument to be passed to the function with the value "foo".

DONE.
