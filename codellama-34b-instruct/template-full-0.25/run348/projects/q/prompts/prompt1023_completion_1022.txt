  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `null` instead of the original value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined` instead of the original value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method is called with a function as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the function instead of the original value of `object`.

DONE.
