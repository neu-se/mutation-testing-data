  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call(promise, exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `resolve` instead of `call`, which would not call the `fulfilled` function with the `promise` and `exception` arguments, leading to a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.call(promise, exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `reject` instead of `call`, which would not call the `rejected` function with the `promise` and `exception` arguments, leading to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed.call(promise, exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `progress` instead of `call`, which would not call the `progressed` function with the `promise` and `exception` arguments, leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
