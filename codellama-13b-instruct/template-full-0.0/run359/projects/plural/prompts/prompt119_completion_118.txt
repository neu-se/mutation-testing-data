  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-z]ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches words ending in "ics" that have a lowercase letter before the "ics" (e.g. "mathics", "statics", "linguistics", "classics", "acoustics").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[A-Z]ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches words ending in "ics" that have an uppercase letter before the "ics" (e.g. "Mathics", "Statics", "Linguistics", "Classics", "Acoustics").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches words ending in "ics" regardless of the case of the letter before the "ics" (e.g. "mathics", "Mathics", "statics", "Statics", "linguistics
