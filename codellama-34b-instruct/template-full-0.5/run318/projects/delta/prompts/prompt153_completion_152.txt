  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to terminate as soon as `otherIter` has no more elements, regardless of whether `thisIter` has more elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext || otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to terminate only when both `thisIter` and `otherIter` have no more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext && otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to terminate only when both `thisIter` and `otherIter` have more elements.

DONE.
