  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the next operation to be one more than it should be, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or double-count operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the next operation to be one less than it should be, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or double-count operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the next operation to be twice what it should be, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or double-count operations.

DONE.
