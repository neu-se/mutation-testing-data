  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the `cb` function with the `abort` argument, while the new code fragment `null` calls the `cb` function with `null` as the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the `cb` function with the `abort` argument, while the new code fragment `undefined` calls the `cb` function with `undefined` as the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the `cb` function with the `abort` argument, while the new code fragment `() => {}` calls the `cb` function with an empty function as the argument.

DONE.
