  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] === base[key] && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and `base[key]` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is equal to `base[key]` and `base[key]` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and `base[key]` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not equal to `base[key]` and `base[key]` is not undefined.
