  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 + domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `0 + domain` would always evaluate to `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.somethingOtherThanExit
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` would no longer be in its exit state, so any code that depends on that state would run differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(domain - 1).exit
```
This would result in different behavior because the domain would be one less than the original value, so any code that depends on the specific value of the domain would run differently.

DONE.
