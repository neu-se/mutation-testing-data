  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildTimezone` is a different function than `buildCountry`, and it would cause the `getCountry` function to return a timezone object instead of a country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return a country object that is not the same as the one returned by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return a country object that is not the same as the one returned by the original code fragment, and it would also cause the `getTimezone` function to return a timezone object that is not the same as the one returned by the original code fragment.

DONE.
