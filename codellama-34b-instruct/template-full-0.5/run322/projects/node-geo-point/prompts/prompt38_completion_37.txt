  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they have different properties and applications.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function that is not used in the original code, and it has a different range of values than `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse function of `cos`, and it has a different range of values than `cos`.

DONE.
