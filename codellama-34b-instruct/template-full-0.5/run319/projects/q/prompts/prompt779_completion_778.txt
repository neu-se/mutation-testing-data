  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method that returns the state of a promise, whereas `then` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value of a promise, whereas `then` is a method that returns the value of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value of an array of promises, whereas `then` is a method that returns the value of a promise.

DONE.
