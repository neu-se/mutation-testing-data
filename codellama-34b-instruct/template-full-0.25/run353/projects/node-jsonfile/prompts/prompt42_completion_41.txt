  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passed one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is a function that takes two arguments, but the original code fragment only passed one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed two arguments to `stringify`, but the new code fragment passes three arguments.

DONE.
