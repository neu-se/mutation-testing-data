  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value 0, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "hello", which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
