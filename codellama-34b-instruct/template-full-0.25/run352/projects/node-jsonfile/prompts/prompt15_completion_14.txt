  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it has a different signature. The `fromCallback` function expects a callback function as its first argument, while the `fromPromise` function expects a promise as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` is a different function than `universalify.fromPromise`, and it has a different signature. The `fromCallback` function expects a callback function as its first argument, while the `fromPromise` function expects a promise as its first argument. Additionally, the `fs.readFile` function is not the same as the `fs.readFileSync` function, which is used in the original code.
