  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be incremented by 1, which could cause the algorithm to skip over certain operations or include extra operations in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be decremented by 1, which could cause the algorithm to miss certain operations or include extra operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the op would be doubled, which could cause the algorithm to include extra operations in the delta or miss certain operations altogether.

DONE.
