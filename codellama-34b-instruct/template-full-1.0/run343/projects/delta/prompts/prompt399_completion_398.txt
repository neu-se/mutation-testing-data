  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'function' &&
            thisData !== null &&
            typeof otherData === 'function' &&
            otherData !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the typeof operator from 'object' to 'function', which will cause the code to evaluate to false even if the data is of type object, and the null check will also fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' &&
            thisData !== null &&
            typeof otherData === 'object' &&
            otherData !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second check from 'object' to 'number', which will cause the code to evaluate to false even if the data is of type number, and the null check will also fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' &&
            thisData !== null &&
            typeof otherData === 'number' &&
            otherData !== null
