  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any input, regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any input, regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.includes('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if the input contains the string "http", regardless of whether it contains illegal characters or not.

DONE.
