  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextChunk()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextChunk()` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream, whereas `nextStream` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` is a function that reads the next stream from the stream of streams, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that reads the next chunk from the current stream.

DONE.
