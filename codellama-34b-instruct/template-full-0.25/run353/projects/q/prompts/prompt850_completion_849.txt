  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(error && "string") === typeof error`, which would always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `error || ("string" !== typeof error)`, which would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator has higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `error || ("string" === typeof error)`, which would always be true.

DONE.
