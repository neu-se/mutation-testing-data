  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is asynchronous, while `universalify.fromCallback` is synchronous, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallbackAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallbackAsync` is asynchronous, while `universalify.fromCallback` is synchronous, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async (fs.writeFile)(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is asynchronous, while `universalify.fromCallback` is synchronous, and vice versa.

DONE.
