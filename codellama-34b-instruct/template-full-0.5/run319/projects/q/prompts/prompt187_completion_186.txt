  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `stackLine` string to lowercase, which could potentially change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `stackLine` string, which could potentially change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/\d/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove all digits from the `stackLine` string, which could potentially change the output of the `getFileNameAndLineNumber()` function.

DONE.
