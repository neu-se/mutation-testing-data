  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `c`, and may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `c`, and may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a different value than `c`, and would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
