  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that adds a new operation to the delta, whereas `push` is a method that adds an operation to the end of the delta's `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` is a different delta object, and `push` is a method that adds an operation to the end of the delta's `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops` is an array of operations, and `push` is a method that adds an operation to the end of an array.

DONE.
