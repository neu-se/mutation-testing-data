  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the error to the nodeback, while this code passes both the error and the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error to the nodeback, while this code only passes the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error and the value to the nodeback, while this code passes the error and null to the nodeback.

DONE.
