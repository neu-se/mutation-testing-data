  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.slice()` always returns a new array, while `messages` may refer to the same array or a different array depending on the context. Replacing `messages` with `messages.slice()` would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to always attach a new message to a new array, which would break the logic of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.push(args)` always returns the new array, while `messages` may refer to the same array or a different array depending on the context. Replacing `messages` with `messages.push(args)` would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to always attach a new message to the end of the array, which would break the logic of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.replace(args)
```
This would result in
