  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'object' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is an object, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is a string, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'number' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is a number, whereas the original code fragment checks if `err` is a function.

DONE.
