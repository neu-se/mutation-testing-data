  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `.replaceAll()` replaces all occurrences of the given regular expression in the string, whereas `.replace()` only replaces the first occurrence. If the `linkurl_path` contains multiple occurrences of the regular expression, `.replace()` will not capture all of them, while `.replaceAll()` will.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\\/index\\.[a-z]+$/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different regular expression match pattern. The `/\\/index\\.[a-z]+$/` pattern matches a string that ends with `/index.` followed by one or more letters `a-z`, while the original pattern matches a string that ends with `/default.` followed by one or more letters `a-z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(index|default)\.[
