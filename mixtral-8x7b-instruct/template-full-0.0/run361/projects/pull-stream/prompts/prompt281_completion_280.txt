 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 * mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the mapper by 1, which doesn't change its value but adds an unnecessary operation. This could potentially cause issues if mapper is a complex expression or a function with side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * mapper
