  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be a guarded emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection123"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be a guarded emitted and because it would result in additional noise in the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejectionRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not be a guarded emitted and because it would result in additional noise in the event loop.

DONE.
