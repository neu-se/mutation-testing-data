  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a non-null value to `Q.defer()`, which would create a new promise that resolves with the given value. In contrast, passing `null` to `Q.defer()` would create a new promise that resolves with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a non-undefined value to `Q.defer()`, which would create a new promise that resolves with the given value. In contrast, passing `undefined` to `Q.defer()` would create a new promise that resolves with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed a non-zero value to `Q
