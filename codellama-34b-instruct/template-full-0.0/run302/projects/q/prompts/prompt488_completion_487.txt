  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called, which would reset the `unhandledRejections` array and the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array would be modified, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to `false`, potentially causing the test to fail.

DONE.
