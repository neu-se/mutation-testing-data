  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy. This could cause the `nextStream` function to be called with a different argument, which could lead to different behavior in the program.
