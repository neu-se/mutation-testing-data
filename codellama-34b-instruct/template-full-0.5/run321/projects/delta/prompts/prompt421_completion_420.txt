  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` returns the length of the current string, while `0` would return the number 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` returns the length of the current string, while `"length"` would return the string "length".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` returns the length of the current string, while `Math.PI` would return the mathematical constant pi.

DONE.
