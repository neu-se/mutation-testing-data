  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the test suite to fail if the test cases are not properly set up to handle variable references.
