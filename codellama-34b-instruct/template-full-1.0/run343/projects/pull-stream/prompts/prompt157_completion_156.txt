  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because `_value` is a different variable than `value`, and the function would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different result if the `value` argument is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different result if the `value` argument is not `null`.

DONE.
