  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while this new code fragment only checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number. If `nextOp.retain` is an object, the original code would return `retain: length`, while this new code would return `retain: nextOp.retain`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `nextOp.retain` is an object and not null, while this new code fragment only checks if `nextOp.retain` is a string. If `nextOp.retain` is an object, the original code would return `retain: length`, while this new code would return `retain: nextOp.retain`.
