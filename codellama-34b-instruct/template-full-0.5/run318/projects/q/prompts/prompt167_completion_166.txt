  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1; i <= lines.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at index 1 instead of 0, and the loop condition would check if i is less than or equal to the length of lines instead of less than the length of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < lines.length + 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, as the length of lines is incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = lines.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of lines instead of the first, and the loop condition would check if i is greater than or equal to 0 instead of less than the length of lines.

DONE.
