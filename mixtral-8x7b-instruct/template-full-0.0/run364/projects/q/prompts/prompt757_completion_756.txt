 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name is changed, and the original `allResolved` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return []; }
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is returned immediately, without waiting for the promises to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"spread"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name is changed, and an undefined function will be called instead of the original `allResolved` function.

DONE.
