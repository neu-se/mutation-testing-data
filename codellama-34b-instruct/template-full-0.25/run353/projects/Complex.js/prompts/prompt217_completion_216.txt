  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh + z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication order is reversed, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `1` is added to the result, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `2` is multiplied to the imaginary part of the result, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

DONE.
