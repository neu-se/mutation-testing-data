  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a function that is defined later in the code, and calling it directly would cause a reference error because the function is not yet defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay, whereas `flush` is a function that is expected to be called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after any pending I/O operations, whereas `flush` is a function that is expected to be called immediately after other tasks have been executed.

DONE.
