  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && "string" === typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(error && "string") === typeof error`, which would always be `false` because the string `"string"` is not the same type as the `typeof error` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error || "string" !== typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(error || "string") !== typeof error`, which would always be `true` because the string `"string"` is not the same type as the `typeof error` value.
