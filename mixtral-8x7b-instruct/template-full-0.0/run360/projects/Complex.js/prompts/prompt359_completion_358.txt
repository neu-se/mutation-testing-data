 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with the sine function, which calculates the trigonometric sine of a number rather than the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with a constant value of 1, which would always result in a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `cosh` method of the current object instead of the global `Math.cos` function. This could lead to different results if the object's `cosh` method behaves differently from the global `Math.cos` function.

DONE.
