  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["then"]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment uses bracket notation instead of dot notation to access the `then` method. This change would cause the promise's `then` method to be invoked as a property instead of a method, which would result in the promise being resolved immediately instead of waiting for the `then` method to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["then"] = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment overwrites the promise's `then` method with a new function that does nothing. This change would cause the promise to be resolved immediately instead of waiting for the original `then` method to be called, and it would also prevent any subsequent code from being executed because the `then` method is no longer defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment uses the `done` method
