  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would cause the code to always return `false`, even if the imaginary part of the complex number is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the code to always return `true`, even if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator would cause the code to always return `false`, even if the imaginary part of the complex number is undefined.

DONE.
