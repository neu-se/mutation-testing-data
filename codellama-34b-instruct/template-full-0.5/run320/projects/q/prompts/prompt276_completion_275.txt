  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the promise would be rejected with a different error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject("This is a different rejection reason");
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different reason, and the error message would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve("This is a different resolution value");
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with a different value, and the error message would be different.

DONE.
