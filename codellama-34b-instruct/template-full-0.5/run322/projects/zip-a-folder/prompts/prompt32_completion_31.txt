  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would not emit an `error` event, but rather an `end` event, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would not emit an `error` event, but rather a `finish` event, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output` stream would not emit an `error` event, but rather a `close` event, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of reject.

DONE.
