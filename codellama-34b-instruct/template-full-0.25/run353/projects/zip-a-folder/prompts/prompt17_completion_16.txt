  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetBasePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the file path is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would remove the first character of the `targetBasePath` string, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the file path is not valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` and `pop()` methods would extract the last part of the `targetBasePath` string, which could cause the `access()` method to fail if the file path is not valid.

DONE.
