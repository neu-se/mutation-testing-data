Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to only proceed if `abort` is falsy, which could prevent the function from executing when `abort` is true, leading to potential missed callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the default callback to `null`, which could lead to a situation where no callback is executed, potentially causing unhandled errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, done && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the first argument to always be `true`, which could lead to the `read` function being called with a constant value, ignoring the actual state of `abort`, and the second argument would only execute if `done` is truthy, potentially skipping necessary cleanup.

DONE.
