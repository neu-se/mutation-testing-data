  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be called after a specified number of milliseconds, while `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be called as soon as possible after the current JavaScript execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
async.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `async` is a library that provides a way to handle asynchronous tasks in a synchronous manner, and `nextTick` is a method that schedules a function to be called as soon as possible after the current JavaScript execution context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that schedules a function to be called as soon as possible after the current JavaScript execution context, and it is part of the Node.js runtime.

DONE.
