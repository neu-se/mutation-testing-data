 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the condition, causing the code block to execute when the `nextType` is not 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `nextType` being `undefined`, which might never be the case, causing the code block to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `nextType` being 'insert', which would cause the code block to execute only when the next operation is an insert, potentially skipping over 'delete' operations.

DONE.
