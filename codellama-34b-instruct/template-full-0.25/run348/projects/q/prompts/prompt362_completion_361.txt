  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be in the "pending" state instead of being fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a rejection reason instead of a fulfillment value.

DONE.
