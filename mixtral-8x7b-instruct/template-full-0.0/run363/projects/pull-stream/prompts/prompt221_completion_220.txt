 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value from the `asyncMap` function would change, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific return values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the value returned by the `asyncMap` function, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `prop` function with the `data` argument, potentially causing tests to fail that are checking for specific function calls or behavior.

DONE.
