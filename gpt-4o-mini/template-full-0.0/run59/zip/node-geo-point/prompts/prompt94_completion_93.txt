Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `acos` function instead of `asin`, which would lead to a different calculation of the latitude resulting in an incorrect destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine of the initial latitude instead of the correct calculation of the sine of the resulting latitude, leading to an incorrect destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + δ
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the angular distance directly to the initial latitude instead of calculating the new latitude based on the spherical trigonometry, which would yield an incorrect destination point.

DONE.
