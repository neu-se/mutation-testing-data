  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be replaced with a function that always returns a value greater than 1, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with a function that always returns a value greater than 1, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(θ) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function would be replaced with a function that always returns a value greater than 1, which would cause the `atan2` function to return a different value.

DONE.
