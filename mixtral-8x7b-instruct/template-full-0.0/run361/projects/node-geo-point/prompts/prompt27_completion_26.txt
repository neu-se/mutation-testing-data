 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the distance as if point1 has a latitude of 0, regardless of its actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the latitude value for the calculations, potentially leading to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the calculations, causing unpredictable and inconsistent results.

DONE.
