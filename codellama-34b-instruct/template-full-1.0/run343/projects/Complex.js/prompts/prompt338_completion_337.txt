  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which adds the constant `1` to `a`, while the substitute code fragment uses the `*` operator, which multiplies `a` by the constant `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which adds the constant `1` to `a`, while the substitute code fragment uses the `*` operator, which multiplies `a` by the constant `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which adds the constant `1` to `a`, while the substitute code fragment uses the `-` operator, which subtracts the constant `1` from `a`.

DONE.
