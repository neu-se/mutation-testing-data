Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the cosine of the argument instead of the sine, leading to incorrect results when calculating the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the tangent of the argument instead of the sine, which could produce significantly different values, especially for angles near Ï€/2 where the tangent function approaches infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a['arg'] + Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively compute the cosine of the original angle (due to the sine phase shift), thus altering the imaginary part of the complex number in a way that does not correspond to the intended calculation.

DONE.
