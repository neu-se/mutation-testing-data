  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`. In the original code, `value instanceof Promise` returns `true` if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` constructor. However, `value === Promise` compares `value` to the `Promise` constructor itself, and would only return `true` if `value` is the `Promise` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` constructor, but also if `value` is the `Promise` constructor itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is(value, Promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `value` is the `Promise` constructor. However, it would return `false` if `value` is an instance of the
