  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the value of `a`, which could change its magnitude and potentially cause the calculation to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could change its magnitude and potentially cause the calculation to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the value of `a` by the value of `b`, which could change its magnitude and potentially cause the calculation to fail.

DONE.
