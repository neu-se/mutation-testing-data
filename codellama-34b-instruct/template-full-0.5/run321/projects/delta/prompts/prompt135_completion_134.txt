  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return a different value, potentially causing the comparison to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return a different value, potentially causing the comparison to succeed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return a different value, potentially causing the comparison to fail.

DONE.
