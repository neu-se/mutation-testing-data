  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is `false`. If `end` is `true`, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is `null`. If `end` is `null`, the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === undefined ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `end` is `undefined`. If `end` is
