  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the value of the `deprecated` option. This will result in the `getAllTimezones` function returning an empty object, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to always return an object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, regardless of the value of the `deprecated` option. This will result in the `getAllTimezones` function returning an object with the `deprecated` property set to `true`, which is different from the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = !options.deprecated
```
This change will cause the `deliverTimezones` function to always return an object
