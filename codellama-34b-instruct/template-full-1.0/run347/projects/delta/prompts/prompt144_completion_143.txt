  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because iter.next() advances the iterator, so the next invocation of iter.peek() would return a different value, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = iter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because iter.peek() does not advance the iterator, so the next invocation of iter.peek() would return the same value as the previous invocation, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOp = {} as Op;
```
This would result in different behavior because {} as Op creates an empty object that does not have the same properties and methods as an Op object, potentially leading to a different execution path.

DONE.
