  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`thisData useful op.retain && otherData useful op.retain`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `useful` operator is not defined,
and would throw an error when the code is executed, causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`thisData.retain[0] && otherData.retain[0]`
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the `retain` property
of `thisData` and `otherData` has at least one element, but the original code checks
for more complex types and uses a nested expression to check if the `retain` properties
of `thisData` and `otherData` exist and are not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Object.getPrototypeOf(thisData.retain) !== Object.getPrototypeOf(otherData.retain)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it
