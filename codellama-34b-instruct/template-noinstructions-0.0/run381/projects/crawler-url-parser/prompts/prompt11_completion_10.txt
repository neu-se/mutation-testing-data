  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the pattern in a case-insensitive manner, which could result in different matches than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to match the pattern in a multi-line manner, which could result in different matches than the original code.

DONE.
