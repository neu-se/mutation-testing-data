  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected if the timeout is reached, but in the modified code, the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Failure")
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected with the error passed to the `timeout` method, but in the modified code, a new error is thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the promise is rejected with an error passed to the `timeout` method, but in the modified code, a new error is thrown that is not the same as the error passed to the `timeout` method.

DONE.
