  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter` is called instead of `domain.exit`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` is called instead of `domain.exit`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.enter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain.enter` is called instead of `domain.exit`.

DONE.
