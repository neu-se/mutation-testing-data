  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to always return without executing the code inside it, which means that unhandled rejections would no longer be tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to always return without executing the code inside it, which means that unhandled rejections would no longer be tracked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `trackRejection` function to always return without executing the code inside it, which means that unhandled rejections would no longer be tracked.

DONE.
