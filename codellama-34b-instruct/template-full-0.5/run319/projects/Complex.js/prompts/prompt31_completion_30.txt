  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator would cause the value of `b` to be negated, which would change the result of the `Math.abs()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the square of `b` would be used instead of the absolute value of `b`, which could change the result of the `Math.log()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` would be increased by 1, which could change the result of the `Math.log()` function.

DONE.
