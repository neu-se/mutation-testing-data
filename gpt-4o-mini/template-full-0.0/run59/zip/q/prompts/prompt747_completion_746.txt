Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is changed, which could lead to unexpected results if the promise is fulfilled before it is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onProgress, onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback is now called only after the `onProgress` callback, which may cause the rejection handling to be skipped or delayed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `onProgress` callback would mean that progress notifications are ignored, potentially leading to a lack of feedback on the promise's state.

DONE.
