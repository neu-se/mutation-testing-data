  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```iter.peekLength()```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` function returns the length of the next element in the sequence, whereas the `peekType()` function returns the type of the next element in the sequence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```iter.next()```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` function returns the next element in the sequence, whereas the `peekType()` function returns the type of the next element in the sequence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```otherIter.next()```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` function returns the next element in the other iterator, whereas the `peekType()` function returns the type of the next element in the current iterator.

DONE.
