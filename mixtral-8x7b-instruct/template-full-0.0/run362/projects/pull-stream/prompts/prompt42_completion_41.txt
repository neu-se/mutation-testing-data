 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which could cause issues if the function is not called as a method of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `apply` method, which expects a context object as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special identifier in JavaScript that provides access to the arguments passed to a function. Using it here would cause the function to use the arguments passed to the inner function, rather than the arguments passed to the outer function.

DONE.
