  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a callback to be called at the next possible opportunity, whereas `setTimeout` will wait for a minimum threshold before executing the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind(window, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind()` creates a new function that is bound to the specified context (in this case, `window`), with the first argument preserved. So the new function will always call `setTimeout` with the `window` context, even if it's called in a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(runSingle, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the execution of the `runSingle` function at the next possible opportunity, rather than the execution of the anonymous function defined in the original code.

DONE.
