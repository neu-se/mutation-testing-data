  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continue
```
This would result in different behavior because `continue` would skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one, whereas `next` would continue executing the loop from the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
break
```
This would result in different behavior because `break` would exit the loop entirely, whereas `next` would continue executing the loop from the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would exit the function entirely, whereas `next` would continue executing the loop from the beginning.

DONE.
