  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `process.stdout`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and potentially altered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `process.stderr`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and potentially altered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this replacement code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `null`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and potentially altered.

DONE.
