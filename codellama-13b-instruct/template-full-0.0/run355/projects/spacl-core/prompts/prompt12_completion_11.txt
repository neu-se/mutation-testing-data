  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be used to match the entire path specification, rather than just the individual path segments. This could potentially cause the matcher to fail to match valid paths, or to match invalid paths that contain characters that are not allowed in the path specification.
