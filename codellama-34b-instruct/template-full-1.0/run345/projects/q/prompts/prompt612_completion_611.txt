  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{<OPERATOR><BIF>
```

This would result in different behavior because {} is a code block, and replace would be trying to do a large string replace, which would return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q.promise;
```

This would result in different behavior because 'new' is a keyword, and replace would be trying to create a new object, which might not be what's intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234;
```

This would result in different behavior because 1234 is a number and not an expression, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
