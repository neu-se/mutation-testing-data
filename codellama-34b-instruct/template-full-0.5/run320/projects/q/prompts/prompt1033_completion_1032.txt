  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the nodeback function, while the replaced code fragment would pass null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the nodeback function, while the replaced code fragment would pass undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the error object to the nodeback function, while the replaced code fragment would pass the string "error".

DONE.
