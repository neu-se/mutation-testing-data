Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the second argument to the callback, regardless of the actual data read, potentially causing downstream consumers of the callback to behave incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, end
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to the callback, which could lead to confusion or errors in any code that expects the first argument to be `end` and the second to be `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the first argument to the callback instead of `end`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the callback relies on the `end` value to determine the state of the stream.

DONE.
