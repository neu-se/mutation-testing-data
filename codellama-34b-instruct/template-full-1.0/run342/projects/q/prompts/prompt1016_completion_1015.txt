  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("ERROR");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error string "ERROR" instead of the actual error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("OK");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the string "OK" instead of the actual value returned by the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("PROGRESS");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified with the string "PROGRESS" instead of the actual progress update.

DONE.
