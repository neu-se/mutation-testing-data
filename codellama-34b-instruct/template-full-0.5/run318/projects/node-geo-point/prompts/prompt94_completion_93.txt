  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, while `cos` is the cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, while `sin` is the sine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, while `tan` is the tangent function.

DONE.
