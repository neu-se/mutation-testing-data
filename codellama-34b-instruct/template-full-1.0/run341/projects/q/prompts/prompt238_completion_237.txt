  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string literal `<PLACEHOLDER>(resolvedPromise)` instead of evaluating the `resolvedPromise` property of the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate the `valueOf` method of the `resolvedPromise` object instead of the `valueOf` method of the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `resolvedPromise` property of the `promise` object, which may not exist if the promise has not been resolved yet.

DONE.
