Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of `point2` instead of `point1`, which would lead to incorrect bearing calculations between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of `point1` instead of the latitude, which would disrupt the calculation of the bearing, as the latitude is essential for the correct trigonometric calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
90
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the latitude value with a constant (90), which would yield a fixed bearing calculation regardless of the actual latitude of `point1`, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
