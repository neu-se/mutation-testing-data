  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` will resolve with the first promise that resolves, whereas `all` will wait for all promises to resolve before resolving the resulting promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` will reject if any of the promises in the array are rejected, whereas `all` will wait for all promises to resolve before resolving the resulting promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
race
```
This would result in different behavior because `race` will resolve or reject as soon as any of the promises in the array are resolved or rejected, whereas `all` will wait for all promises to resolve before resolving the resulting promise.

DONE.
