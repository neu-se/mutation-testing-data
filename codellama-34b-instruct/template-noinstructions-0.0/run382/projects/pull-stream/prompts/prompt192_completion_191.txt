  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, function (err, data) {
  busy = false
  if(aborted) {
    cb(aborted)
    abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
  }
  else if(err) next (err, cb)
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `busy` variable is not set to `false` before calling the `map` function, which could cause the `busy` variable to be `true` even if the `map` function has not completed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map(data, function (err, data) {
  if(aborted) {
    cb(aborted)
    abortCb && abortCb(aborted)
  }
  else if(err) next (err, cb)
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
