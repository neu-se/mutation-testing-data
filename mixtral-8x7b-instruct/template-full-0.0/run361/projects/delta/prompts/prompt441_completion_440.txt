 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have different behavior when the second argument is negative or greater than the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.toUpperCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase` returns a new string in uppercase, while `substr` returns a substring of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('')` returns an array of characters, while `substr` returns a substring of the original string.

DONE.
