  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to delete the wrong number of characters, leading to an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain one more character than it should, leading to an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to retain one fewer character than it should, leading to an incorrect result.

DONE.
