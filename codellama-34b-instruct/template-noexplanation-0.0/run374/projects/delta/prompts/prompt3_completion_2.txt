  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(b)
```
This code fragment will create a deep clone of the `b` object, which is the second argument passed to the `compose` function. This is the same behavior as the original code fragment, which called `cloneDeep` on the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(a)
```
This code fragment will create a deep clone of the `a` object, which is the first argument passed to the `compose` function. This is different behavior than the original code fragment, which called `cloneDeep` on the `b` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(a, b)
```
This code fragment will create a deep clone of both the `a` and `b` objects, which are the first and second arguments passed to the `compose` function. This is different behavior than the original code fragment, which called `cloneDeep` on only the `b
