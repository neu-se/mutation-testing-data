  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the function, which is undefined, rather than the original value.

DONE.
