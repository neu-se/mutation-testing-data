  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `href` attribute, even if the attribute is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the `href` attribute to `http://example.com`, even if the attribute is not present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', $(this).attr('href') + '#anchor')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the `#anchor` fragment to the value of the `href` attribute, even if the attribute is not present.

DONE.
