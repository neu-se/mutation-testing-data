  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Deprecation warning: Q.defer is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use Q.Promise instead.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a deprecation warning to the console, which would not occur with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn("Deprecation warning: Q.defer is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use Q.Promise instead.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a deprecation warning to the console using `console.warn`, which would not occur with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.defer is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Use Q.Promise instead.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, which would not occur with the original code.

DONE.
