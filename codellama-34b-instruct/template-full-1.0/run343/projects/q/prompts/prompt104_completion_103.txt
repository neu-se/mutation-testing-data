  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because the ++operator would increment the index by 1 before being used in the arguments array, whereas the original index is not modified and is used as-is in the arguments array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the index is set to 1, so the `array_reduce` function would only receive the first element in the array as its initial value, and the reduce function would only be applied to the first element, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `void 0` expression would evaluate to `undefined`, so the `array_reduce` function would treat the first element in the array as its initial value, rather than treating the index as the initial value.

DONE.
