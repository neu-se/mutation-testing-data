  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(5 - input)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs()` function is used to get the absolute value of the difference between `5` and `input`, whereas the original code fragment only used `Math.abs()` to get the absolute value of `input`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(input / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator is used to divide `input` by `2`, whereas the original code fragment used the `/` operator to divide `input` by `60`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(input - 5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator is used to subtract `5` from `input`, whereas the original code fragment used the `-` operator to subtract `utcOffset` from `input`.

DONE.
