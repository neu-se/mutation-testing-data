  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be treated as a literal, rather than as a reference to the `policy` object, which is likely to cause an error or unexpected behavior when the `policy.query()` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be treated as a literal, rather than as a reference to the `policy` object, which is likely to cause an error or unexpected behavior when the `policy.query()` method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, Policy.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Policy.prototype` object is used as the value for the `policy` object, rather than the actual `policy` object itself. This could cause errors or unexpected behavior when the `policy.query()` method is called, as it expects a `Policy`
