  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `arg` property instead of the `abs` property. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This code fragment uses the `re` property instead of the `abs` property. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['im']
```
This code fragment uses the `im` property instead of the `abs` property. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the specific values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
