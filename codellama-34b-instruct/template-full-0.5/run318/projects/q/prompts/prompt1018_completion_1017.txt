  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object, while the new code fragment `null` would resolve the promise with the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object, while the new code fragment `undefined` would resolve the promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the error object, while the new code fragment `throw new Error("test")` would throw an error with the message "test".

DONE.
