  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `const embedType = 'image';`
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return invalid embed type and data, leading to a crash or incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `const embedType = 'Embed';`
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return invalid embed type and data, leading to a crash or incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `const embedType = 'service';`
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return invalid embed type and data, leading to a crash or incorrect output.

DONE.
