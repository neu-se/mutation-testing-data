Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `end` is strictly equal to `null`, which would only pass if `end` is exactly `null`, ignoring other falsy values like `undefined` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `end` is not strictly equal to `false`, which would allow other truthy values to pass through, potentially leading to unintended behavior when `end` is a different falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `end` is greater than `0`, which would only pass for positive numbers, completely changing the logic and potentially causing the operation to be skipped for valid `end` values that are `0` or negative.

DONE.
