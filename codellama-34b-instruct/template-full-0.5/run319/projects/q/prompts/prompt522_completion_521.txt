  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would pass the exception to the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("This is a buggy code fragment"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with a different error message, whereas the original code fragment would return a rejected promise with the original error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise with the original error message, whereas the original code fragment would return a rejected promise with a different error message.

DONE.
