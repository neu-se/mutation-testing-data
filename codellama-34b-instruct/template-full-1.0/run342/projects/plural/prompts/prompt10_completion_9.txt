  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|qui$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `quy` substring is no longer matched, which would result in the rule being bypassed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|qw$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qw` substring is no longer matched, which would result in the rule being bypassed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|qupi$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qupi` substring is no longer matched, which would result in the rule being bypassed.

DONE.
