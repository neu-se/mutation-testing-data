  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the squared length of a complex number, whereas this modified code fragment is calculating the difference of the squared lengths of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the squared length of a complex number, whereas this modified code fragment is calculating the product of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calculating the squared length of a complex number, whereas this modified code fragment is calculating the ratio of the real part to the imaginary part.

DONE.
