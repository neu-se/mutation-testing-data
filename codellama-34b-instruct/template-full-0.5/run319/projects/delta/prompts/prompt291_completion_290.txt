  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different amount than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a fixed amount, rather than by the length of the current operation, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by the length of the current operation in the other iterator, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
