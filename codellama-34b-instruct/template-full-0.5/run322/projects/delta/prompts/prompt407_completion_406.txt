  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the arguments passed to the `invert` method, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(otherData[embedType], thisData[embedType], !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `!priority` argument to the `transform` method, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.transform(thisData[embedType], otherData[embedType], priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `priority` argument to the `transform` method, which could cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
