  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.done called with no arguments");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if `Q.done` is called with no arguments, but the replaced code fragment would throw an error in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.done called with non-promise argument");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if `Q.done` is called with a non-promise argument, but the replaced code fragment would throw an error in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.done called with promise that is not pending");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not throw an error if `Q.done` is called with a promise that is not pending, but the replaced code fragment would throw an error in that case.

DONE.
