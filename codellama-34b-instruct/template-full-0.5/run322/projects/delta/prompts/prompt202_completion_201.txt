  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with a non-numeric argument, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with a non-numeric argument, which would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(<PLACEHOLDER>.length || 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method would be called with a non-numeric argument, which would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
