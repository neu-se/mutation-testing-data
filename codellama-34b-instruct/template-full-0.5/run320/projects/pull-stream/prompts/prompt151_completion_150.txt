  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments, but the original code fragment only passes two arguments to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass a fourth argument to `abortCb`, but this modified code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `value` as the third argument to `abortCb`, but this modified code fragment passes `null` instead.

DONE.
