  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src" + "different folder"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the source and target folders are different, but this replacement code would always return true, even if the folders are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(",")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the source is a glob, but this replacement code would always return the first item in the glob, even if the source is not a glob.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace("src", "different folder")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the source and target folders are different, but this replacement code would always return a different folder, even if the folders are the same.

DONE.
