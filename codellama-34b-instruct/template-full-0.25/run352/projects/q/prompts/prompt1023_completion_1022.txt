  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then` is a different method than `Q(object).nodeify`, and it would not call the `nodeback` function with the result of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).catch` is a different method than `Q(object).nodeify`, and it would not call the `nodeback` function with the result of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).finally` is a different method than `Q(object).nodeify`, and it would not call the `nodeback` function with the result of the promise.

DONE.
