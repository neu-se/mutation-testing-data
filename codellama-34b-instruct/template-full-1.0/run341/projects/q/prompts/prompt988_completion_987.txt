  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `get` method instead of the `post` method, which could cause the code to behave differently and potentially introduce bugs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `put` method instead of the `post` method, which could cause the code to behave differently and potentially introduce bugs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `patch` method instead of the `post` method, which could cause the code to behave differently and potentially introduce bugs.

DONE.
