Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the cosine function to the sine function, which will yield different results for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with the square of the imaginary part, which will not produce the same output and will affect the calculation of the imaginary component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it substitutes the cosine function with the tangent function, leading to a completely different calculation for the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
