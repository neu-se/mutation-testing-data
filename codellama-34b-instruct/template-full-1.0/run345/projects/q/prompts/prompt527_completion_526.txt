  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function expects an object as an argument, but `null` will cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the same as `undefined` and the `dispatch` function expects an object as an argument, but `undefined` will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object has different properties and methods than the original object, and the `dispatch` function may not work correctly.

DONE.
