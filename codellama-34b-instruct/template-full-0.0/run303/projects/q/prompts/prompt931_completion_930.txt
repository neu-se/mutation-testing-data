  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a different method than `apply`, and it would change the way the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the context of the function call to `null`, which could cause errors if the function relies on `this` being a specific value.

DONE.
