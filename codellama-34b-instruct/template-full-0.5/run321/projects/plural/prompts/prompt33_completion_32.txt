  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` and `substr` have different parameters and usage. `substr` takes two parameters, the starting index and the length of the substring, while `slice` takes one parameter, the starting index, and returns the substring to the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `substr` have different parameters and usage. `substring` takes two parameters, the starting index and the ending index, while `substr` takes one parameter, the starting index, and returns the substring to the end of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` and `substr` have different purposes. `split` splits a string into an array of substrings based on a separator, while `substr` returns a substring of a string.

DONE.
