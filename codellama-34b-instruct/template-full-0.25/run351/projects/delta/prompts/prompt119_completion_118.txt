  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.insert` is a different value than `elem`, and the code that uses the PLACEHOLDER relies on the value of `elem` being a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.delete` is a different value than `elem`, and the code that uses the PLACEHOLDER relies on the value of `elem` being a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different value than `elem`, and the code that uses the PLACEHOLDER relies on the value of `elem` being a specific value.

DONE.
