  The code I have been given is a piece of JavaScript code that provides a way to convert a NodeJS continuation-passing function to a function that returns a promise. The code provides a way to convert a function that takes a callback parameter to a function that returns a promise. The code does this by wrapping the function in a promise and resolving the promise when the callback is called.

To apply mutation testing to this code, I would start by identifying the critical sections of the code that are responsible for the most important functionality. In this case, the critical sections would be the `Q.nfbind`, `Q.nbind`, `Q.nmapply`, `Q.nsend`, `Q.nmcall`, and `Q.ninvoke` functions. These functions are the key to the functionality of the code, as they allow the user to convert a NodeJS continuation-passing function to a promise-returning function.

Once I have identified the critical sections of the code, I would start applying small changes to these sections to see how they affect the functionality of the code. For example, I might change the operator `post` to `send`, or change the
