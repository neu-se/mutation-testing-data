  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument from the `array_slice` function, which would cause the resulting array to have one fewer element than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` array from the first element to the second-to-last element, which would cause the resulting array to have one fewer element than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` array from the first element to the second-to-last element, which would cause the resulting array to have one fewer element than the original.

DONE.
