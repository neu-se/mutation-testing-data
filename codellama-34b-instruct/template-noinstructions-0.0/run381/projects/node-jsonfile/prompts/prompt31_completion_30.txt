  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value. In the original code, the `stringify` function is called with `options` as an argument, which is an object with properties such as `encoding` and `reviver`. If `null` is passed instead, the `stringify` function will throw an error because it expects an object as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object. In the original code, the `stringify` function is called with `options` as an argument, which is an object with properties such as `encoding` and `reviver`. If an empty object is passed instead, the `stringify` function will not have access to the same properties and may not produce the same output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
