  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise that is fulfilled with the `value` instead of the `promise` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise that is fulfilled with the `value` instead of the `promise` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a promise that is fulfilled with the `promise` itself instead of the `value`.

DONE.
