  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are two different methods that have different effects on the promise. `resolve` will fulfill the promise, while `reject` will reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is not a method of the promise. It is a method of the `deferred` object, and it is used to resolve the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a method of the promise that is used to send progress notifications to the promise's observers. It is not used to reject the promise.

DONE.
