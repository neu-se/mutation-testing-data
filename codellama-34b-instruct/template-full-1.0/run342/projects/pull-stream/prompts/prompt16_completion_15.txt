  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would now be comparing the length of the `ref` array to `length - 1`. As a result, any tests that expect the `switch` statement to match against `length` would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would now be comparing the length of the `ref` array to `length * 2`. As a result, any tests that expect the `switch` statement to match against `length` would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `switch` statement would now be comparing the length of the `ref` array to `0`. As a result, any tests that expect the `switch` statement to match against `length` would fail.

DONE.
