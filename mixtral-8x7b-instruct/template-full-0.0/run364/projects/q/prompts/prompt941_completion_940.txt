 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the actual implementation of `array_slice`, but using an array literal instead of the global `array_slice` variable may cause issues if the code relies on that variable being a specific value or having specific properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is the internal method used by `array_slice`, but directly accessing it may bypass any modifications or overrides to the `array_slice` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.slice` does not exist, so this would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it, causing the code to fail in a different way than the original implementation.

DONE.
