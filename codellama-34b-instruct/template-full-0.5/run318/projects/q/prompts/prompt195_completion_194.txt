  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the array instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the third element of the array instead of the second element, which is the line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the array instead of the line number.

DONE.
