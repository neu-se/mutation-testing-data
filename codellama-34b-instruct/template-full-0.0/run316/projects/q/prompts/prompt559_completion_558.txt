  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a custom function that checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `instanceof` is a built-in operator that checks if the exception is an instance of the specified class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.name` checks if the exception has the name "StopIteration".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` checks if the exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, while `exception.constructor` checks if the exception's constructor is `StopIteration`.

DONE.
