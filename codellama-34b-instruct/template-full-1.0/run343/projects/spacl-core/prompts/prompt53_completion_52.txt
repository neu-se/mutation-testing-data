  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/ ]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of one or more characters that is not a forward slash or a space, whereas the original code fragment would match any sequence of one or more characters that is not a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([abc]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of one or more characters that is not a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment would match any sequence of one or more characters that is not a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/ */]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of one or more characters that is not a forward slash or a space, whereas the original code fragment would match any sequence of one or more characters that is not a forward slash or a star.

DONE.
