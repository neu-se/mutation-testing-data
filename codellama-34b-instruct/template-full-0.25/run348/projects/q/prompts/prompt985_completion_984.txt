  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` would create a new function that is bound to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` would not. This could potentially cause issues if the `dispatch` method relies on the `this` context to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` would call the `dispatch` method with the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` would not. This could potentially cause issues if the `dispatch` method relies on the `this` context to function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` would call the `dispatch` method with the current `this` context,
