  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(c^2 + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cosh(c)` instead of `Math.sqrt(c^2 + 1)`, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(c^2 - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cos(c)` instead of `Math.sqrt(c^2 - 1)`, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(c^2 + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `cosh(c)` instead of `Math.sqrt(c^2 + 1)`, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
