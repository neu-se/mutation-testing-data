  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is NaN, while `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isNaN` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the code to produce incorrect results in certain cases, such as when the divisor is zero.

DONE.
