  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `a` object, but it would not check if the key exists in the `b` object before assigning it to `attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `b` object, but it would not check if the key exists in the `a` object before assigning it to `attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a || b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `a` object or the `b` object, whichever is not null or undefined.

DONE.
