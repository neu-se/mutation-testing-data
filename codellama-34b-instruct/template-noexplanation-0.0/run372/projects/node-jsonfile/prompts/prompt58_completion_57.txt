  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + EOL
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to add an extra newline character at the end of the string, which may not be desired in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to not add any newline characters at the end of the string, which may be desired in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + ' '
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to add a space character after the newline character, which may be desired in some cases.

DONE.
