  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).all` returns a promise for an array of values, whereas `Q(value).spread` returns a promise for the result of spreading the values of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).any
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).any` returns a promise for the first fulfilled value of the array, whereas `Q(value).spread` returns a promise for the result of spreading all the values of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).some
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value).some` returns a promise for the first fulfilled value of the array that satisfies the predicate, whereas `Q(value).spread` returns a promise for the result of spreading all the values of the array.

DONE.
