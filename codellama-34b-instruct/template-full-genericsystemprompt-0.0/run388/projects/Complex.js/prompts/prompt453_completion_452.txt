  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the real parts of the two complex numbers instead of the imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the product of the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers instead of their difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the sum of the real part of the first complex number and the imaginary part of the second complex number instead of their difference.

DONE.
