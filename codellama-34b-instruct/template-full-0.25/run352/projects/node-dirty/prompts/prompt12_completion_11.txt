  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the key to uppercase, which would cause the `get()` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the key with the string `'foo'`, which would cause the `get()` method to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the key, which would cause the `get()` method to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
