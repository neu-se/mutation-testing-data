 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare keys from `a` instead of `attr`, potentially missing mismatched values for shared keys between `attr` and `base`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `attr` parameter completely, always returning an empty object or `undefined` if there are no keys in `base`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider keys from `b`, potentially missing mismatched values for keys unique to `attr`.

By introducing these changes, the test suite may reveal weaknesses in testing edge cases, such as handling missing keys, different keys, or mismatched values between `attr` and `base`. DONE.
