  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` for the second occurrence of the item, instead of passing it through as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `false` for the second occurrence of the item, instead of passing it through as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unique` function would return `null` for the second occurrence of the item, instead of passing it through as the original code does.

DONE.
