  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isZero`, and it would cause the `div` function to return a different result when the divisor is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a different method than `isZero`, and it would cause the `div` function to return a different result when the divisor is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different method than `isZero`, and it would cause the `div` function to return a different result when the divisor is not a finite number.

DONE.
