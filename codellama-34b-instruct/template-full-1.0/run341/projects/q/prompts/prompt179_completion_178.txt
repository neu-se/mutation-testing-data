  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `.includes()` checks whether a string includes a certain substring, whereas `.indexOf()` checks whether a string contains a certain substring. In this case, using `.includes()` would not catch all occurrences of `"(node.js:"` in the string, and would return a false negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `.search()` uses a regex to search for a pattern in a string, whereas `.indexOf()` checks for a specific substring. In this case, using `.search()` with a regex could catch all occurrences of `"(node.js:"` in the string, but using a regex could also lead to false positives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `.lastIndexOf()` searches for a substring from the end of the string, whereas `.indexOf()` searches for a
