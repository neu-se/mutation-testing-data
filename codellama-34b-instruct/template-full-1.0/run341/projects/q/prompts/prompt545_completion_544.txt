  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.send(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `send` method is used instead of the `next` method, which could lead to different control flow and possible unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.throw(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` method is used instead of the `next` method, which could lead to different control flow and possible unintended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator.return(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` method is used instead of the `next` method, which could lead to different control flow and possible unintended behavior.

DONE.
