  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, which is a valid value, while `undefined` is not a valid value and would cause the function to return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, which is a valid value, while `true` is not a valid value and would cause the function to return an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, which is a valid value, while `false` is not a valid value and would cause the function to return an error.

DONE.
