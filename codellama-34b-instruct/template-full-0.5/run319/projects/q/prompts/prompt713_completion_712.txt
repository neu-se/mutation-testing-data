  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because the "values" method is not defined in the code, so it would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "keys" method expects an empty array as its argument, but passing [1] would cause it to return the keys of the object at index 1, rather than the keys of the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", ["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "keys" method expects an empty array as its argument, but passing ["foo"] would cause it to return the keys of the object at index "foo", rather than the keys of the object itself.

DONE.
