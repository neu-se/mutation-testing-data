  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with an empty object `{}` as the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, line.attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the `line` object's `attributes` property as the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, line.ops[i].attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with the `line` object's `ops[i]` property's `attributes` property as the second argument, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
