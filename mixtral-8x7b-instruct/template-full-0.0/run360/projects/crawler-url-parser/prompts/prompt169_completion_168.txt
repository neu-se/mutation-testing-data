```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the link's path with the base URL's path instead of the original linked URL's path. This might cause incorrect classification of link types when the base URL and linked URL share a common domain but have different paths.

```javascript
pageurl_path + "/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a forward slash to the base URL's path when comparing with the link's path. This might cause incorrect classification of link types when the base
