  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run indefinitely, causing a stack overflow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

DONE.
