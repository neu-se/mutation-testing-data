  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the first `n-1` elements of the `answerPs` array, rather than all `n` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the last `n-1` elements of the `answerPs` array, rather than all `n` elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over every other element of the `answerPs` array, rather than all `n` elements.

DONE.
