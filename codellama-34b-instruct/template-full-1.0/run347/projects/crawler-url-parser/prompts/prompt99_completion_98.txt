  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method returns the values contained in the Map object, whereas the `has` method checks if the Map object contains a specific key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof urlMap != 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of a value, and the `!=` operator checks if two values are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns the value associated with the specified key, and the `length` property returns the length of a string or array.

DONE.
