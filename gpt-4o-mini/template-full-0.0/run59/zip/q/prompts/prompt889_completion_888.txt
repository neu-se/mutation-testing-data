Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array instead of the actual arguments, leading to the callback being called with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number of arguments instead of the arguments themselves, which would not be valid for the `nfapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array from the arguments, which could potentially include additional properties or methods that are not part of the original arguments array, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
