  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "https", which could cause issues with the URL's validity and functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'mailto:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "mailto", which would cause the URL to be interpreted as an email address rather than a web address.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'javascript:'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "javascript", which would cause the URL to be interpreted as a JavaScript code snippet rather than a web address.

DONE.
