  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function checks if the input is a glob pattern, and the original code fragment checks if it is not a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src) && src !== '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `src !== '*'` would exclude the case where the input is a glob pattern that matches all files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src) && src !== '**'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `src !== '**'` would exclude the case where the input is a glob pattern that matches all files and directories.

DONE.
