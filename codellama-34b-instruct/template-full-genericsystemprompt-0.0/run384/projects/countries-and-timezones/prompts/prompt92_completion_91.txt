  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
