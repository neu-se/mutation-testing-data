 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method of `Promise.prototype` expects a valid object as the first argument, and `null` would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` has different behavior than `Q` in handling immediate references and promises. This could lead to unexpected results or test failures in cases where the behavior of `Q` is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { /* empty function */ }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function reference that is expected to be called with specific arguments. An empty function would not behave as expected, causing potential test failures or unexpected results.

DONE.
