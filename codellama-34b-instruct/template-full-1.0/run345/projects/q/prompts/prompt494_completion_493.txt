  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `reason` is passed as an argument to `rejected`, while `null` would simply be passed as a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `reason` is passed as an argument to `rejected`, while an empty object would not have the same behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `reason` is passed as an argument to `rejected`, while `undefined` would simply be passed as an undefined value.

DONE.
