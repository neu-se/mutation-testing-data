  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over the first character of each line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `eachLine` method to include an extra character at the end of each line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `eachLine` method to include every other character in the line.

DONE.
