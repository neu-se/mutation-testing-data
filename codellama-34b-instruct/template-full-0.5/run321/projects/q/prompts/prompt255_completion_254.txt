  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `message` is an array, and `message[0]` would be a different value than `message`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.slice(1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, while `message` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `message.length` would return the length of the `message` array, while `message` would return the array itself.

DONE.
