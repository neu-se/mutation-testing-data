  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return null, even if there are attributes that are different between the two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return undefined, even if there are attributes that are different between the two objects.

DONE.
