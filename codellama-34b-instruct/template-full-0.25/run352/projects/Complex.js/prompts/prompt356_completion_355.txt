  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `b`. This change would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially break the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b * 2` is an expression that multiplies the value of `b` by 2. This change would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially break the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b - 1` is an expression that subtracts 1 from the value of `b`. This change would cause
