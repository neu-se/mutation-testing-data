  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the matched words to uppercase, whereas the original code fragment would leave the words unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would remove the last character of the matched words, whereas the original code fragment would leave the words unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACE
