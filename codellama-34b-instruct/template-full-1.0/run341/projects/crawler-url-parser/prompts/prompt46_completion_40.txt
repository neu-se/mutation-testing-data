  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object representing the parsed URL, rather than a string representing the formatted URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` takes two URLs and returns a new URL that is the result of resolving the second URL against the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL + '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a question mark character to the end of the URL, which would be treated as a query parameter separator.

DONE.
