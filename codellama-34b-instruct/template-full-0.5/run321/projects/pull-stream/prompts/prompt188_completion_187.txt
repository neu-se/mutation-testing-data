  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, leading to a different element being returned from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at twice the index instead of the actual element at the index, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at the next index instead of the actual element at the index, leading to a different result.

DONE.
