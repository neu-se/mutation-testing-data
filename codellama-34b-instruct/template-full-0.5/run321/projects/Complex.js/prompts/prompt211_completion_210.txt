  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the difference of `b` and `a`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the sum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment calculates the difference.

DONE.
