  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterias')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a rule for the word "criterion" with the plural form "criteria", while the modified code fragment adds a rule for the word "criterion" with the plural form "criterias".

DONE.
