  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(absoluteUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.parse()` will return an object with the url parts, unlike `.format()` that returns a string. The remaining code expects a string, and would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(absoluteUrl) + '#id'
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `#id` would be appended to the string, which the code doesn't handle properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.resolve()` returns a URL object, not a string, which would throw an error.

DONE.
