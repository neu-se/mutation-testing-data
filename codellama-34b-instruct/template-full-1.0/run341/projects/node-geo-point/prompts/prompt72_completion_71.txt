  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER>(distance) / radius + 1>
```
This would result in different behavior because the "radius" variable is not defined and the code would produce a "ReferenceError".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```(distance - 1) / radius>
```
This would result in different behavior because the "1" is an extraneous value and would modify the calculation of the angular distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<PLACEHOLDER>(distance) / radius >
```
This would result in different behavior because the "radius" variable is not defined and the code would produce a "ReferenceError".

DONE.
