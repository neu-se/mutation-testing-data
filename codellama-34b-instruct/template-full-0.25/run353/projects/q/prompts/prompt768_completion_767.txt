  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop)` is a resolved promise, while `promise, noop, noop` is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)` is a resolved promise, while `promise, noop, noop` is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)` is a
