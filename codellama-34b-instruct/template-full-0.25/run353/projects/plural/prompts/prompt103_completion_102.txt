  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "tiger" is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger|zebra)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "zebra" is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger|zebra|unicorn)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "unicorn" is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
