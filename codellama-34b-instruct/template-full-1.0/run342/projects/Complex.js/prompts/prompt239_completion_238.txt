  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of the given number, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the given number. In the context of the code snippet provided, replacing `Math.sqrt` with `Math.cos` would cause the code to calculate the cosine of the argument rather than the square root, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3.14
```
This would result in different behavior because `3.14` is a constant value, whereas `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a given number. In the context of the code snippet provided, replacing `Math.sqrt` with `3.14` would cause the code to use a constant value rather than calculating the square root of the argument, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x++
```
This would result in different behavior because `x
