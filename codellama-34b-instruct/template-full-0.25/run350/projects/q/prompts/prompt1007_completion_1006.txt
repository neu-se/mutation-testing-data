  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.reverse()` is a function that reverses the order of the elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.concat(1)` is a function that concatenates the elements of an array with the number 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice.length` is a property that returns the number of elements in an array.

DONE.
