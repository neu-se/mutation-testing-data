  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would not be called on the `Delta` object, and the `changeLength` method would return `0` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would not be called on the `Delta` object, and the `changeLength` method would return `0` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would be called on an empty object, and the `changeLength` method would return `0` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
