  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved asynchronously, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that is resolved synchronously.

DONE.
