  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` instead of `fail` is called on the promise. `reject` will immediately reject the promise with the argument it receives without attempting to recover, while `fail` will attempt to handle and recover from the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is handled and recovered from instead of being rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).then(function () {}, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is handled and recovered from instead of being rejected immediately. It also adds an additional `then` call, which could potentially cause additional behavioral changes.

DONE.
