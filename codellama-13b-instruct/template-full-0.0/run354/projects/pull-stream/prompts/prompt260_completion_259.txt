  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream(<PLACEHOLDER>)
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would be executed differently. In the original code, the `if` statement would only be executed if `err` is truthy. In the modified code, the `if` statement would be executed if `err` is truthy or if `err` is equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function (err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream(<PLACEHOLDER>)
    else read(true, function(abortErr)
