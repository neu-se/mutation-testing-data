Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[0-9]$/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string starts and ends with a digit, instead of checking if the string starts with a non-digit character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!= ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string is not empty, instead of checking if the string matches a specific pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
includes('$')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string includes the character '$', instead of checking if the string matches a specific pattern, which could lead to incorrect prefixing of the switches string.

DONE.
