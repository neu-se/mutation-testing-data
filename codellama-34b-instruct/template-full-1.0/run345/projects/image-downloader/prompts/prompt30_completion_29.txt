  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft` and `trimRight` have different effects on the string. `trimLeft` removes whitespace from the beginning of the string, while `trimRight` removes whitespace from the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.length` returns the length of the string, while `url.trimLeft` returns a new string with the leading whitespace removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.indexOf('http://')` returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring 'http://' in the string, while `url.trimLeft` returns a new string with the leading whitespace removed.

DONE.
