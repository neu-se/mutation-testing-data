 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...urlMap.values()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array from the iterator returned by `urlMap.values()`. The original code fragment iterates over the `urlMap` entries directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array of keys instead of values. The original code fragment uses the values from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values(Object.fromEntries(urlMap))
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `urlMap` to an object and then back to an array, potentially changing the order of elements. The original code fragment iterates over the `urlMap` entries directly.

DONE.
