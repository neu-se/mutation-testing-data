 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of a single line, an empty array would be passed to the predicate function, causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<div></div>'
```
This would result in different behavior because a string with HTML content would be passed to the predicate function, which expects a Delta object, causing unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '\n', attributes: { bold: true } }
```
This would result in different behavior because an object with an 'insert' property and additional 'attributes' property would be passed to the predicate function, causing unexpected results or errors, as the function is not designed to handle attributes.

DONE.
