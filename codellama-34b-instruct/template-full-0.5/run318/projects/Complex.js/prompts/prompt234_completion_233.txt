  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the case where `a` is equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the case where `a` is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the case where `a` is equal to zero.

DONE.
