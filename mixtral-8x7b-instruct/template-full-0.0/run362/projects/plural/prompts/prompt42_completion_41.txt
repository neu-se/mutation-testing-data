 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the incorrect substring for words like 'appendix' and 'index'. The original code fragment (0) is used as a fixed index to replace the last two characters of the word, while w.length would change based on the length of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the incorrect substring for words like 'appendix' and 'index'. By changing the index to -2, it would replace the last two characters with 'ices', but it would also change the behavior for words like 'goose' and 'mouse', which should have 'es' appended instead of 'ices'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.slice(-2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the incorrect substring for words like 'appendix' and 'index'.
