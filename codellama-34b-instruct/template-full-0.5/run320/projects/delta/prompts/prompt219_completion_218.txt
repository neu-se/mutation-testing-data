  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two Delta objects have the same operations, while this replacement checks whether they have different operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length !== other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the two Delta objects have the same number of operations, while this replacement checks whether they have different numbers of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0] !== other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the first operation of the two Delta objects is the same, while this replacement checks whether the first operation of the two Delta objects is different.

DONE.
