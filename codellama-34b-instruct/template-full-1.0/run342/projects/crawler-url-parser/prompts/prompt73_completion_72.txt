  I have completed the mutation testing with three different mutants:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` function would be called with a different argument, `'src'`, instead of `'href'`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially resulting in a different value for `href` and `baseUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'origin'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` function would be called with a different argument, `'origin'`, instead of `'href'`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially resulting in a different value for `href` and `baseUrl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'protocol'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` function would be called with a different argument, `'protocol'`, instead of `'href'`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially resulting in a different
