  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones + 1
```
This change will cause the `getAllTimezones` function to always return all timezones, regardless of whether they have been memoized or not. This will test the edge case where the number of memoized timezones is equal to the total number of timezones, which may not be covered by the existing test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones - 1
```
This change will cause the `getAllTimezones` function to always return all timezones, except for the last one. This will test the edge case where the number of memoized timezones is one less than the total number of timezones, which may not be covered by the existing test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones * 2
```
This change will
