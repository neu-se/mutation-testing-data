  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of strings, whereas `match` returns null or an array of matching strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, whereas `match` returns an array of all matching substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value in the string, whereas `match` returns an array of all matching substrings.

DONE.
