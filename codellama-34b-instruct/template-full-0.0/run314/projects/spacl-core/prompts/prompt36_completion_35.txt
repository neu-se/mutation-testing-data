  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the resulting array to have a different length and content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method is called on the resulting array, which would cause the resulting string to have a different length and content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('') + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `/` is added to the resulting string, which would cause the `match` method to fail.

DONE.
