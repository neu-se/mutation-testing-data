  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a==0` would always return `false` because `a` is never equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a!=0` would always return `true` because `a` is always non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a=0` would set `a` to zero, causing the `if` statement to be bypassed.

DONE.
