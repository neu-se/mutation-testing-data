  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `b` variable directly, while the replaced code fragment is squaring the `b` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `b` variable directly, while the replaced code fragment is adding `a` and `b` together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `b` variable directly, while the replaced code fragment is squaring both `a` and `b` and adding them together.

DONE.
