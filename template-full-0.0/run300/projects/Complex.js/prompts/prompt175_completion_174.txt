  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `c` is less than `d`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a` is greater than `b`, regardless of the values of `c` and `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b < c + d
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a + b` is less than `c + d`, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

DONE.
