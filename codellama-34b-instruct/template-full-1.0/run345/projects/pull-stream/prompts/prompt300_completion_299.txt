  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because when `ended = true`, the original code fragment would return `ended`, but the new code fragment would return `!ended`, which is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because when `ended = true`, the original code fragment would return `ended`, but the new code fragment would return `false`, regardless of the value of `ended`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when `ended = true`, the original code fragment would return `ended`, but the new code fragment would return `null`, regardless of the value of `ended`.

DONE.
