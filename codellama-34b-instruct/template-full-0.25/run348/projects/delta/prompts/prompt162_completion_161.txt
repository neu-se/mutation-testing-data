  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by `length` steps, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one step less than `length`, potentially missing important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by twice `length`, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
