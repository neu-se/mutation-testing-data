  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.split("#")[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removed the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment splits the URL into an array using the fragment identifier and keeps the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.toLowerCase();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not change the case of the URL, while the new code fragment converts the URL to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = currentUrlStr.split(":")[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the protocol from the URL, while the new code fragment splits the URL into an array using the colon character and keeps the second element of the array.

DONE.
