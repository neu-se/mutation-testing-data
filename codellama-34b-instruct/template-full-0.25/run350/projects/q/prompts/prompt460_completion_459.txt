  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array is not equal to -1, indicating that the promise is not in the array. By replacing it with `at === -1`, the code would check if the index is equal to -1, which would result in the opposite behavior, and the promise would be considered handled even if it is not in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index of the promise in the `unhandledRejections` array is not equal to -1, indicating that the promise is not in the array. By replacing it with `at < -1`, the code would check if the index is less than -1, which would result in the opposite behavior, and the promise would be considered handled even if it is not in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
