 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[this['im'], this['re']]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the arguments passed to `Math.atan2()`, which expects the imaginary part as the first argument and the real part as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(this['im'] / this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.atan()` function instead of `Math.atan2()`, which can lead to incorrect results when the real part is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the real and imaginary parts before passing them to `Math.atan2()`, which can lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
