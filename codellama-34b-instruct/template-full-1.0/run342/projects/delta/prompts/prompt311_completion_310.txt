  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i + 1` would skip the current iteration of the while loop, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or duplicate certain lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i + 2` would skip two iterations of the while loop, potentially causing the algorithm to miss or duplicate more than one line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `i - 1` would repeat the current iteration of the while loop, potentially causing an infinite loop if used unconditionally.

DONE.
