  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `allSettled()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a subset of the array, starting from the second element. This would cause the `allSettled()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([Q.reject("error")])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method adds a new element to the end of the array, which would cause the `allSettled()` method to return a rejected promise.

DONE.
