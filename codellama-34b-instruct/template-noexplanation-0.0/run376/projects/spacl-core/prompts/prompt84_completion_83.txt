  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This code fragment creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.clone())
```
This code fragment creates a new array containing only the cloned rules from the original `rules` array, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.map(rule => rule.clone())
```
This code fragment creates a new array containing the cloned rules from the original `rules` array, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
