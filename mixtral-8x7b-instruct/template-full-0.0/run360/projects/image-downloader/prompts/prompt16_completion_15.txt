 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to use a relative path relative to the current file, instead of using the provided `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current working directory as the base path, instead of using the provided `options.dest`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number instead of using the provided `options.dest`, which would cause the function to fail when trying to resolve the destination path.

DONE.
