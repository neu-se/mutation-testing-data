  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: newOp.insert, attributes: newOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new op with the same `insert` value as the previous op, rather than the `insert` value of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: lastOp.insert, attributes: lastOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new op with the `insert` value of the previous op, rather than the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: newOp.insert, attributes: lastOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new op with the `insert` value of the current op, but the `attributes` value of the previous op.

DONE.
