  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind` is a different function than `call.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.call` is a different function than `call.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind(null)` is a different function than `call.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
