  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `insert` property of the `elem` object, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `delete` property of the `elem` object, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `retain` property of the `elem` object, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
