  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of `this.hasNext()`, so if the iterator has a next element, the negated result would be `false`, and if the iterator does not have a next element, the negated result would be `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator calls the `hasNext` method, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has a next element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext && this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both conditions are true, and if the iterator has a next element and the current index is less than the length of the `ops` array, the result would be `true`, otherwise it would be `false`.

DONE.
