 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses `Array.prototype.slice` to convert the arguments object to an array, while the original code relies on the `<PLACEHOLDER>` being automatically converted to an array-like object by the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of an empty array instead of using `Array.prototype.slice`, which might not work as expected if the `slice` method has been overwritten on the `Array.prototype`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `slice` is a method of the `arguments` object, which is not guaranteed across all JavaScript environments.
