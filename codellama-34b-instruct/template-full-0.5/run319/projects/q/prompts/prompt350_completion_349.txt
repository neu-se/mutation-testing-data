  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(function (value) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
}, "when", [function (exception) {
    if (done) {
        return;
    }
    done = true;

    deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
}]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` would be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick(function () {
    deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
}, "when", [function (exception) {
    deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
}]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` would be called with a different function, potentially leading to a different execution path.
