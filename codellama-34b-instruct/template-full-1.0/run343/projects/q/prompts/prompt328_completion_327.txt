  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which will throw an error when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is the same as `undefined` and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which will throw an error when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have a `promiseDispatch` method, which will throw an error when trying to access it.

DONE.
