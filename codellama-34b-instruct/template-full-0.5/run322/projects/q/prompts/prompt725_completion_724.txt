  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` is not a valid property of a promise object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.value` is not a valid property of a promise object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` is not a valid property of a promise object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
