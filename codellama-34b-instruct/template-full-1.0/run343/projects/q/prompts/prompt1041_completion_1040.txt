  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the deferred promise with the given `error`, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the deferred promise with the value `Q.defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)`\.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(null)` would reject the deferred promise with a `null` reason, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the deferred promise with the value `Q.defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)`\.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(error)

This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(error)` would resolve the deferred promise with the value `error`, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the deferred promise with the value `Q.defer(<PLACEHOL
