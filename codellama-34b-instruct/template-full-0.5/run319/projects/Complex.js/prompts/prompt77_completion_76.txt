  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which could cause the loop to run fewer times or skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, which could cause the loop to run more times or skip over certain iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j++
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would increment `j` instead of `i`, which could cause the loop to operate on a different variable or object.

DONE.
