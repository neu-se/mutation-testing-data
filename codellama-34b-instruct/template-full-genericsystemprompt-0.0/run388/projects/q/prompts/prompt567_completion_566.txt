  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the result, which would change the final value returned by the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the result by 2, which would change the final value returned by the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the result, which would change the final value returned by the function.

DONE.
