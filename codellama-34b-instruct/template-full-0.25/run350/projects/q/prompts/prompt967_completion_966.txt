  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, whereas `args` by itself would pass a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the elements of `args`, whereas `args` by itself would pass a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map(function(x) { return x; })` creates a new array that is a copy of the original `args` array, whereas `args` by itself would pass a reference to the original array.

DONE.
