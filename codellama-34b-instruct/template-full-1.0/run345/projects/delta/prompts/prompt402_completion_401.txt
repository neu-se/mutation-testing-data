  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `otherData[embedType]` would return `undefined` if `embedType` does not exist as a property in `otherData`, whereas `Object.keys(otherData)[0]` would return the first property name in `otherData`, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete otherData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the property from `otherData`, whereas the original code fragment would just check if the property exists but would not modify the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[embedType]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherData[embedType]()` would attempt to invoke the property value as a function, whereas the original code fragment would just check if the property exists and would not attempt to invoke it.

DONE.
