  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns the sine of an angle in radians, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of an angle in radians. Using `sin` instead of `cos` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acos` function returns the arccosine of a value, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of an angle in radians. Using `acos` instead of `cos` would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, whereas the `cos` function returns the cosine of an angle in radians. Using `Math.PI` instead of `cos
