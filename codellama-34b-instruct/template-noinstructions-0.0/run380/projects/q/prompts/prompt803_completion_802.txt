  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function expects a function as its second argument, but `null` is not a function and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function expects a function as its second argument, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function expects a function as its second argument, but `() => {}` is a function that does nothing and would cause the function to return a promise that never resolves.

DONE.
