  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `process` object has an `emit` method, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `process` object has a `then` method. This could cause the code to behave differently in environments where the `process` object has a `then` method but not an `emit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.then === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `process` object has an `emit` method, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `process` object has a `then` method.
