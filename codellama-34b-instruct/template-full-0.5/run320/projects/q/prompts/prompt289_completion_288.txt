  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver()` is a function call, while `resolver` is a function reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver.call(this)` is a function call with a specific `this` context, while `resolver` is a function reference that can be called with any `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolver.bind(this)` is a function reference that is bound to a specific `this` context, while `resolver` is a function reference that can be called with any `this` context.

DONE.
