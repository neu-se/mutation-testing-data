  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `next` method to be called without any arguments. In this case, the `next` method would return the next operation in the `other` delta, which would result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `1`, which would cause the `next` method to return the next operation in the `other` delta, but only if it is a retain operation. If the next operation is not a retain operation, the `next` method would return `undefined`, which would result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of `
