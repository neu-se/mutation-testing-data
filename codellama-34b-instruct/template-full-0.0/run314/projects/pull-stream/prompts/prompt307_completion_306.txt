  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `null` as the first argument, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with `ended` as the first argument, which is a boolean indicating whether the stream has ended or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `null` as the first argument, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not.

DONE.
