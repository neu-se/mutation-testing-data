Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the new operation to be pushed to the `ops` array when the index is greater than the current length, which should not happen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the new operation to be pushed to the `ops` array even when the index is not equal to the current length, potentially leading to unexpected results in the order of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the new operation to be pushed if the index is less than the second-to-last position in the `ops` array, which could lead to operations being skipped or incorrectly inserted.

DONE.
