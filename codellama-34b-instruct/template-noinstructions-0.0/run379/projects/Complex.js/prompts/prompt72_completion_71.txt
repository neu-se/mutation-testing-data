  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tokens` is null, but this new code fragment checks if `tokens` is undefined. If `tokens` is null, the original code fragment would enter the `if` block and call `parser_exit()`, but if `tokens` is undefined, the new code fragment would not enter the `if` block and would not call `parser_exit()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `tokens` is null, but this new code fragment checks if `tokens` is an empty array. If `tokens` is null, the original code fragment would enter the `if` block and call `parser_exit()`, but if `tokens` is an empty array, the new code fragment would not enter the `if` block and would not call `parser_exit()`.
