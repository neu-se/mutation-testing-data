  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for 'insert' or 'retain', while this code only checks for 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for 'insert' or 'retain', while this code only checks for 'retain'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for 'insert' or 'retain', while this code only checks for 'insert' and requires the length to be greater than 0.

DONE.
