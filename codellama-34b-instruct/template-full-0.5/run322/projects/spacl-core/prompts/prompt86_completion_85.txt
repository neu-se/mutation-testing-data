  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `clone` method on the `rule` object, which may have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `clone` method on the `rule` object with a `false` argument, which may have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `clone` method on the `rule` object with a `true` argument, which may have a different implementation than the original code.

DONE.
