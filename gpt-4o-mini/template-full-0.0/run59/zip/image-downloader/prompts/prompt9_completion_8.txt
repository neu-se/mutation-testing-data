Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination string is empty instead of checking for a file extension, which would allow the code to proceed even if the destination is not a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination starts with 'http', which would incorrectly allow URLs to be treated as valid destinations, bypassing the intended file path validation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.includes('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination contains a period, which could incorrectly validate paths that do not have a proper file extension, leading to potential issues with file handling.

DONE.
