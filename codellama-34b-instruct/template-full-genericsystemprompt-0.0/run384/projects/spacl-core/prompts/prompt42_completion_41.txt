  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.length` would return the length of the `part` string, whereas `part` would return the string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the `part` string, whereas `part` would return the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.split('')` would return an array of individual characters in the `part` string, whereas `part` would return the string itself.

DONE.
