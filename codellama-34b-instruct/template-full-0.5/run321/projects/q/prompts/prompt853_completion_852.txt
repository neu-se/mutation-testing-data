clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a function that clears the interval timer that was set with the `setInterval` method, while `clearTimeout` is a function that clears the timer that was set with the `setTimeout` method.

Replacing `clearTimeout` with `setTimeout` would cause the timer to be set multiple times, leading to unexpected behavior.

```

```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a
