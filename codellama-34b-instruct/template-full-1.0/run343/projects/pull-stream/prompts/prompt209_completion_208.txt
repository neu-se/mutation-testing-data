  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `aborted` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!map
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `map` is falsy, while this code fragment checks if `map` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `aborted` is null, while this code fragment checks if `aborted` is not null.

DONE.
