  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).then(defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).catch(defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]).finally(defer())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
