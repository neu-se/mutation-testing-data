  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
