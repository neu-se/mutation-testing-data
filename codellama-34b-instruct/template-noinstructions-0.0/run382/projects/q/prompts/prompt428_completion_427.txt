  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `null`, whereas it would return `true` for `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for `undefined`, whereas it would return `true` for `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function would return `false` for an empty object, whereas it would return `true` for `object`.

DONE.
