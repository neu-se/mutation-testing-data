  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists on the `zipAFolderOptions` object, while this new code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property is not undefined. If the `customWriteStream` property is not defined, the original code would fall back to the default behavior, while this new code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists on the `zipAFolderOptions` object, while this new code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property is not null. If the `customWriteStream` property is null, the original code would fall back to the default behavior, while this new code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
