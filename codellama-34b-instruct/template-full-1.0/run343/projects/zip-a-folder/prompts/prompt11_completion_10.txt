  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, and `split()` is a method on the string prototype that returns an array of strings. Replacing `src` with `src.split(',')` would result in an array of strings being passed to the `glob()` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, and `src[0]` returns the first character of the string. The `glob()` method expects a string pattern, not a single character, so passing `src[0]` would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, and `toLowerCase()` is a method on the string prototype that returns a new
