  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the mathematical operation would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the mathematical operation would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the mathematical operation would be different every time the code is executed.

DONE.
