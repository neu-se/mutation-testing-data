Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key, "extraArg"]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra argument to the dispatch call, which may cause the underlying method to behave differently or throw an error if it does not expect more than one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("fetch", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "get" to "fetch", which may not be defined in the dispatch method, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", []);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an empty array as the arguments instead of an array containing the key, which would likely result in the method not retrieving the intended property value.

DONE.
