  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics" but do not end in "icses", while this code fragment would apply the rule to all words that end in "ics", resulting in incorrect pluralization for words like "statistics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only applies the rule to words that end in "ics" but do not end in "icses", while this code fragment would apply the rule to all words that end in "ics", resulting in incorrect pluralization for words like "statistics".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'ies' })
