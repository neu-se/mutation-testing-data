  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callback and errback arguments is reversed, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback argument is missing, which could cause unhandled errors to be thrown instead of being caught and handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being passed to the `when` function, which could cause it to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
