Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if the complex number is infinite by summing the real and imaginary parts, which does not accurately determine if the complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses multiplication instead of the intended check for infinity, leading to a nonsensical condition that will not correctly identify infinite complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part is infinite, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to false negatives for complex numbers that are infinite but have a finite real part.

DONE.
