  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `super` keyword is used to access the `match` method of the parent class, whereas the original code fragment uses the `this` keyword to access the `match` method of the current class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword is used to access the `match` method of the current class, whereas the original code fragment uses the `super` keyword to access the `match` method of the parent class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.match
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword is used to access the `match` method of the current class, whereas the original code fragment uses the `super` keyword to access the `match` method of the parent class.

DONE.
