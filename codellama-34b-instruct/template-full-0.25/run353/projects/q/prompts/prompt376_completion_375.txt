  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(newValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(newValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
