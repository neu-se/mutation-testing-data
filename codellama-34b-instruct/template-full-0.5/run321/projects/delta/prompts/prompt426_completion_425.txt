  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `delete` property is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it is null. If the `delete` property is null, the original code would return 1, while this new code would return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `delete` property is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it is not null. If the `delete` property is not null, the original code would return 1, while this new code would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `delete` property is a number, while this new code fragment checks if it is an object. If the `delete` property is an object,
