  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the start index of the line by 1, which could affect the calculation of the index of the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the start index of the line by the length of the line, which could affect the calculation of the index of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the start index of the line by the length of the next op on the other iterator, which could affect the calculation of the index of the newline character.

DONE.
