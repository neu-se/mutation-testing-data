  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `busy`, which means that the `if` statement would be executed even if `busy` is false, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks the truthiness of both operands, and if the second operand is `false`, the entire expression will evaluate to `false`, which means that the `if` statement would not be executed even if `busy` is true, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks the truthiness of both operands, and if the second operand is `true`, the entire expression will evaluate to `true`, which means that the `if` statement would be
