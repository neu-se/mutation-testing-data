  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a value of `null`, instead of the original value of the `rejected` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a value of `null`, instead of the original value of the `rejected` parameter, but also pass a value of `null` as the first argument to the `rejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, rejected
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, but with the `void 0` expression explicitly added to the first argument of the `rejected` function.

DONE.
