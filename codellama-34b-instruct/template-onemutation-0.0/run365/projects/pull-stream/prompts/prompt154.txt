Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'
var abortCb = require('../util/abort-cb')

module.exports = function once (value, onAbort) {
  return function (abort, cb) {
    if(abort)
      return abortCb(cb, abort, <PLACEHOLDER>)
    if(value != null) {
      var _value = value; value = null
      cb(null, _value)
    } else
      cb(true)
  }
}



```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
onAbort
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answer as a fenced code block containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
