  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `currentUrl.url` as the key for the map, while the new code is using a combination of `currentUrl.url` and `currentUrl.baseurl` as the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `currentUrl.url` and `currentUrl.baseurl` as separate keys, while the new code is concatenating them into a single key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl + currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `currentUrl.url` and `currentUrl.baseurl` as separate keys, while the new code is concatenating them into a single key in a different order.

DONE.
