 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(thisData)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the embedType with the first key of the `thisData` object instead of the `otherData` object. This change would cause the transformation to behave differently when both `thisData` and `otherData` have the same embedType.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === 'embed'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always checks for a specific embedType, 'embed', instead of comparing the embedType with the keys of the `otherData` object. This change would cause the transformation to behave differently for any operation that has a different embedType.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType in otherData
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the embedType is an enumerable property of the `otherData` object instead of comparing it with the keys. This change would cause the transformation to
