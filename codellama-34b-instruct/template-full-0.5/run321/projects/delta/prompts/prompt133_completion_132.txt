  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, while `1` is just a constant value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` returns the length of an operation, while `2` is just a constant value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of an operation, which could cause errors in the code that uses the length.

DONE.
