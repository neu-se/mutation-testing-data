  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `equals` method to always return `true`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the `equals` method to always return `false`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] / this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would cause the `equals` method to always return `true`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
