  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['theta']
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['theta']` is not a valid property of the `a` object, whereas `a['phi']` is a valid property that refers to the `a` object's `phi` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['phi'] + 1` is a different value than `a['phi']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['theta'](a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['theta'](a['phi'])` is a function call with the `a['theta']` function and the `a['phi']` argument, whereas `a['phi']` is just a property reference.

DONE.
