  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if the verb is not in the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the `verb` property, even if the `verb` property is not in the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.hasOwnProperty(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if the `verb` property is in the `verbs` object.

DONE.
