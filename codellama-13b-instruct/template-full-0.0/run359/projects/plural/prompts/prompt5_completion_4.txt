  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `toString` method of the `Object` prototype, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `toString` method of the `Object` prototype, but with an additional `call` method call. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when executed, as the `call` method is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `toString` method of the `Object` prototype, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `toString` method of the `Object` prototype, but with an additional `bind` method call. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` when executed, as the `bind` method is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
