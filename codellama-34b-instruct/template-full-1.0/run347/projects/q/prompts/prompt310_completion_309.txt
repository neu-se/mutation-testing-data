  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: void.
This would result in different behavior because void is a JavaScript operator that evaluates to undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 0.
This would result in different behavior because 0 is not a function and would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: "hello".
This would result in different behavior because "hello" is a string and is not a valid function argument.

DONE.
