  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, verb, ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` variable is not being used in the original code fragment, but it is being used in the replacement code fragment. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb, ctx, path
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different in the replacement code fragment. This could cause the `query` method to return different results for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, verb
```

DONE.
