  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for a slash at the beginning of the string would pass even if there is no slash present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for a slash at the end of the string would pass even if there is no slash present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^\//) || spec.match(/\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for a slash at either the beginning or the end of the string would pass even if both are not present.

DONE.
