  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "throw"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to indicate that the generator should continue to the next iteration, while "throw" would cause the generator to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to indicate that the generator should continue to the next iteration, while "return" would cause the generator to return a value and exit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer, "yield"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses "next" to indicate that the generator should continue to the next iteration, while "yield" would cause the generator to yield a value and pause.

DONE.
