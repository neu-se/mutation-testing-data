  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator onto the delta, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the this iterator onto the delta, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the other iterator onto the delta with a length of `length`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
