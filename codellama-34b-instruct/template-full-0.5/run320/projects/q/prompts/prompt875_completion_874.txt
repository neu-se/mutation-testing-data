  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise with an error, while this new code fragment would simply reject the promise without providing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise with an error, while this new code fragment would resolve the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `deferred.reject(error)` to reject the promise with an error, while this new code fragment would notify the promise with a value.

DONE.
