Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the provided value instead of resolving it, leading to a promise that is in a rejected state rather than fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `undefined`, which may not be the intended resolution value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise consumers that expect a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null`, which is a valid value but may not be the intended resolution, causing confusion for consumers of the promise that expect a meaningful value.

DONE.
