  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value that would always be returned, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * a` would be a different calculation than `b`, and would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {
  return b;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the value of `b`, rather than the value of `b` as defined in the original code.

DONE.
