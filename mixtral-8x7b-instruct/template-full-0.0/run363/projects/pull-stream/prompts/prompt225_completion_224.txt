 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => !filter(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `filter` function instead of the `test` function passed as an argument. This change would not take into account any preprocessing or modifications that the `test` function might apply to the data before testing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => !test.apply(this, [data])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method to call the `test` function, which may result in different context binding or argument handling compared to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => !test(data, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes an additional argument (`this`) to the `test` function, which might not be designed to handle extra arguments or may interpret them differently, leading to different test outcomes.
