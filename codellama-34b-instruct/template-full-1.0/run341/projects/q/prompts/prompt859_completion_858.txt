  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejected error would be resolved instead of being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error instead of rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would send a notification instead of rejecting the promise.

DONE.
