  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `pull` function is being passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first argument as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument of the `pull` function is being passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first argument as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument of the `pull` function is being passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first argument as in the original code.

DONE.
