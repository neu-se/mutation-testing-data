  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable is used to index into the `unhandledRejections` array, and adding 1 to it would cause the code to access an index that is out of bounds, resulting in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable is used to index into the `unhandledRejections` array, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the code to access an index that is out of bounds, resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `at` variable is used to index into the `unhandledRejections` array, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the code to access an index that is out of bounds, resulting in an error.

DONE.
