  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would return "samelevel" for two URLs that have the same number of path parts, regardless of whether they are on the same level or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would return "uplevel" for two URLs that have a different number of path parts, but the first URL has fewer parts than the second URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function would return "sublevel" for two URLs that have a different number of path parts, but the first URL has more parts than the second URL.

DONE.
