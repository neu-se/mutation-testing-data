  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` only creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy, which means that nested objects and arrays are also copied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` is called on the `newOp` object, which is a different object than the one that is being cloned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(this.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep` is called on the `this.ops` array, which is a different array than the one that is being cloned.

DONE.
