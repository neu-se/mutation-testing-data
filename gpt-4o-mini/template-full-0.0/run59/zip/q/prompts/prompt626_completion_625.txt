Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `get` method instead of the `dispatch` method, which would lead to an error if `get` is not defined on the promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("get", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls `dispatch` with additional arguments, which may not be handled properly by the `dispatch` method, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("set", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from `set` to `get`, which means it would not set the value as intended, and instead, it would try to retrieve the value of the property, leading to incorrect functionality.

DONE.
