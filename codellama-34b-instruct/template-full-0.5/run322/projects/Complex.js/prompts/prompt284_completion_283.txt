  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. This would cause the `cos` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `tan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the sum of the `a` and `b` variables, which would change the value of the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses twice the value
