  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method expects a value to be returned, but `null` is a falsy value that would be coerced to the promise `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method expects a value to be returned, but `undefined` is a falsy value that would be coerced to the promise `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method expects a value to be returned, but `0` is a falsy value that would be coerced to the promise `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
