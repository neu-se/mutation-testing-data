  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test case would fail to detect the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Empty lines are not allowed in the database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test case would fail to detect the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('The database contains empty lines')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the test case would fail to detect the error.

DONE.
