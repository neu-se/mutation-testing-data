  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called on the promise returned by `Q(callback).nfapply(args)`. However, if we replace it with `0`, the `then` method would not be called, and the promise returned by `Q(callback).nfapply(args)` would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `then` method would be called on the promise returned by `Q(callback).nfapply(args)`. However, if we replace it with `2`, the `then` method would be called twice, and the promise returned by `Q(callback).nfapply(args)` would be resolved twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `
