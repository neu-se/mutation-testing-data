  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to continue even if the source and target folders are the same, which could lead to unintended consequences such as overwriting the source folder.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, regardless of the value of `targetBasePath`, and would therefore always throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.includes(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of `targetBasePath` includes the value of `src`, rather than checking for strict equality. This could potentially allow the code to continue even if the source and target folders are not the same, which could lead to unintended consequences.

DONE.
