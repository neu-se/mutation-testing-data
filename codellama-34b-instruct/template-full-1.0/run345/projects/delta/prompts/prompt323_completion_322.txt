  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `baseIndex` is used to slice the `base` Delta, while in the mutated code, `baseIndex + 1` is used. This would lead to different slicing behavior, as the slice would start from the next index instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `baseIndex` is used to slice the `base` Delta, while in the mutated code, `baseIndex * 2` is used. This would lead to different slicing behavior, as the slice would start from the current index multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `baseIndex` is used to slice the `base` Delta
