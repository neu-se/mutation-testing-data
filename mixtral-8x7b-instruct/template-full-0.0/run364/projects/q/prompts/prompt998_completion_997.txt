 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `makeNodeResolver` is supposed to be a callback function, not a boolean. This change may cause the test to pass silently or throw an error, depending on how the `makeNodeResolver` function is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeResolver()
