  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the replacement code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the entire path, while the replacement code fragment checks the path starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the entire path, while the replacement code fragment checks only the last part of the path.

DONE.
