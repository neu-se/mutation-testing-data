  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor matches the start of the string, so the regex would only match if the `#` is at the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag makes the regex match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase `#` characters.

DONE.
