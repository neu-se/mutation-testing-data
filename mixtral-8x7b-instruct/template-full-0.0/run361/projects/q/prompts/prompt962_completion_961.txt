 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<PLACEHOLDER>.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the first element of the `arguments` object, while the original code returns the `arguments` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `arguments` object to a real array, allowing the use of array methods like `slice()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `arguments` object to a real array by concatenating its elements using `apply()` and `concat()`.

DONE.
