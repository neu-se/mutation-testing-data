  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values. As a result, the `currentUrl` variable would be assigned the key of each entry in the `urlMap` object, rather than the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values().reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method returns a new iterator that iterates over the values of the `urlMap` object in reverse order. As a result, the `currentUrl` variable would be assigned the value of each entry in the `urlMap` object in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs of the
