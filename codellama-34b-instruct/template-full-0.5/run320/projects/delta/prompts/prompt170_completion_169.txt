  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation in the `other` delta, which may not be the same as the current operation in the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.peek());
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` would return the next operation in the `other` delta, which may not be the same as the current operation in the `this` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.peek(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek(length)` would return the next `length` operations in the `other` delta, which may not be the same as the current operation in the `this` delta.

DONE.
