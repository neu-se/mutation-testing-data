  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes no arguments, but `nextStream()` would call the function immediately, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes no arguments, but `nextStream(null)` would call the function with a null argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that takes no arguments, but `nextStream(undefined)` would call the function with an undefined argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
