  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to be called instead of the `set` method, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `post` method to be called instead of the `get` method, which would lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to be called instead of the `get` method, which would lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
