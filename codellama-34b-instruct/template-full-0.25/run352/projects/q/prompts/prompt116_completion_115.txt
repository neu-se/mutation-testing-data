  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the second element instead of the first, potentially skipping the first element and causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the previous element instead of the current one, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would start iterating from the double of the current element instead of the current one, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
