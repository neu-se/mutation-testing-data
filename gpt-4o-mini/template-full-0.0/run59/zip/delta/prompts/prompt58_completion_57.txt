Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat a string as a valid input, leading to the assumption that `ops` is an array when it is not, potentially causing runtime errors or unexpected behavior later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ops` is an instance of `Array`, which may not work correctly in certain contexts (e.g., if `ops` is an array-like object from a different frame or context), leading to incorrect handling of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `ops` has a length greater than zero, which would not validate whether `ops` is actually an array, potentially leading to errors when trying to access properties or methods that are not available on non-array types.

DONE.
