  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 100 to the distance, which would cause the calculated destination to be 100 meters different than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the distance, which would cause the calculated destination to be twice as far away from the origin as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the distance, which would cause the calculated destination to be half as far away from the origin as the original code.

DONE.
