  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pluralizes the word if it is not already plural, but this new code fragment would always add an 's' to the end of the word, even if it is already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pluralizes the word if it is not already plural, but this new code fragment would always remove the last character of the word, even if it is already plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only pluralizes the word if it is not already plural, but this new code fragment would always convert the word to uppercase, even if it is already plural.

DONE.
