  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback function with the generated value as the second argument, whereas the original code only calls it when `end` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate(end))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the generated value as the second argument, but only when `end` is falsy, which would be a change in behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(generate(end), null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the generated value as the first argument, but only when `end` is falsy, which would be a change in behavior.

DONE.
