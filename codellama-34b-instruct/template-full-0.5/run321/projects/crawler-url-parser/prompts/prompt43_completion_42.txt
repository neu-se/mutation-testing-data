  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a different set of properties, than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a different set of properties, than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with a different set of properties, than the original code.

DONE.
