  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `Math.cos` function to be called with a different argument, which would change the result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `Math.sin` function to be called with a different argument, which would change the result of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` would cause the `Math.cos` function to be called with a different argument, which would change the result of the function.

DONE.
