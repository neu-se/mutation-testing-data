  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `thisIter.peekType() == 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft` would never be satisfied, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would not be a valid operand for the `-` operator, causing a TypeError to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would not be a valid operand for the `-` operator, causing a TypeError to be thrown.

DONE.
