  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a promise that resolves to the value of the variable `Q`, but replacing it with `null` would cause the promise to resolve to `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a promise that resolves to the value of the variable `Q`, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the promise to resolve to `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a promise that resolves to the value of the variable `Q`, but replacing it with `0` would cause the promise to resolve to `0` instead.

DONE.
