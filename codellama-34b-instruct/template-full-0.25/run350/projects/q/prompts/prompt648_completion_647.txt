  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `1` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `null` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument `undefined` would be passed to the `dispatch` method, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
