  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `args` to be an array, but `undefined` will cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `args` to be an array, but `null` will cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `args` to be an array, but `0` will cause a runtime error.

DONE.
