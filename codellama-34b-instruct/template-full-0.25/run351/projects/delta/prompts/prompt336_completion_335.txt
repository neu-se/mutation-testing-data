  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for an object, but this code checks for a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a non-null object, but this code checks for null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a non-null object, but this code checks for undefined.

DONE.
