  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns a promise that notifies about progress, while `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null reference, while `_fulfilled` is a non-null reference to a function.

DONE.
