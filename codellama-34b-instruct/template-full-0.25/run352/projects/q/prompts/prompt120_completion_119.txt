  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `hasOwnProperty` method of the `Object` prototype instead of the `hasOwnProperty` method of the `Object` instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(this, [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `apply` method of the `Function` prototype to call the `hasOwnProperty` method with the `this` value bound to the `Object` instance and the `key` value as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(this)(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `bind` method of the `Function` prototype to create a new function that has the `this` value bound to the `Object` instance
