  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects, causing the resulting object to have the properties of `b` overwritten by the properties of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the properties of `b`, ignoring the properties of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the properties of `a`, ignoring the properties of `b`.

DONE.
