  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without parentheses returns the type of the iterator itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` advances the iterator to the next operation and returns the current operation, while `peekType` returns the type of the next operation without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
