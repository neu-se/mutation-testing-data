  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of a `Policy` object, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` instead of `true` if the policy exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of a `Policy` object, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` instead of `true` if the policy exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of a `Policy` object, which would cause the `matches` method to return `false` instead of `true` if the policy exists.

DONE.
