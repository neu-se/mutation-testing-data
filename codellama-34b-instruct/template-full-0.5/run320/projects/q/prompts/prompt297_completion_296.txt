  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always return `x`, regardless of the value of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to return a different value than `y`, which would be used to compare with `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to return a different value than `x`, which would be used to compare with `y`.

DONE.
