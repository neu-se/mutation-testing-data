  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function with the `this` context set to `this`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `getHandler` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `getHandler` method with the `this` context set to `this`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `getHandler` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method calls the `getHandler` method with the `this` context set to `this`, which could potentially change the behavior of the `getHandler` method.

DONE.
