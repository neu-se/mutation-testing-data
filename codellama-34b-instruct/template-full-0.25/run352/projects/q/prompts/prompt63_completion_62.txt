  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have a `nextTick` method, unlike `window`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a `nextTick` method, unlike `window`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, which does not have a `nextTick` method, unlike `window`.

DONE.
