 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.rest().ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `ops` property of the `rest` object directly, instead of calling the `length` method on the `ops` array. This change may cause issues if the `ops` property is ever changed to something other than an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses the length of the first operation in the rest of the iterator, instead of the minimum length of the remaining operations. This change may cause issues if there are operations with different lengths in the rest of the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? thisIter.peekLength() : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the length of insert operations, and ignores other types of operations. This change may
