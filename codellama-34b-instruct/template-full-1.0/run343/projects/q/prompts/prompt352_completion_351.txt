  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is the function that resolves a promise, while `reject` is the function that rejects it. This change would cause the promise to resolve successfully, even if it was supposed to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement in JavaScript that throws an exception. This change would cause the promise to be rejected, but the `exception` variable is not defined, which would result in a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error("Not implemented"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a new `Error` object, but with the message "Not implemented". This change would cause the promise to resolve successfully, even if it was supposed to be rejected.

DONE.
