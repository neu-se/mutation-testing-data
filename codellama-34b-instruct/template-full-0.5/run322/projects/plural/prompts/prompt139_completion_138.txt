  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word unchanged if it was already plural, while the replaced code fragment would always add an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word unchanged if it was already plural, while the replaced code fragment would remove the last character of the word and then add an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/s$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word unchanged if it was already plural, while the replaced code fragment would remove any 's' characters from the end of the word and then add an 's' to the end of the word.

DONE.
