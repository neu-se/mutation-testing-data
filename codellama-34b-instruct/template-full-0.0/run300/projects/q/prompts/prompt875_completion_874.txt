  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, while this replacement code fragment uses `deferred.reject` directly, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately instead of after the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, while this replacement code fragment uses `deferred.resolve` directly, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately instead of after the timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, while this
