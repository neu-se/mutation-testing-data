  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]` would always evaluate to `true`, even if the two arrays have different embed types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` could potentially be a string, which would cause `Object.keys(b)[0]` to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(b).length` could potentially be 0, which would cause `Object.keys(b)[0]` to throw an error.

DONE.
