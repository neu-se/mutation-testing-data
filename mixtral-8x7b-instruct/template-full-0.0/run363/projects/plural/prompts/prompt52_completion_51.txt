 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function now appends a single 'e' instead of 'es', changing the pluralization of words ending in a vowel followed by 'o'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[^aeiou]e$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
