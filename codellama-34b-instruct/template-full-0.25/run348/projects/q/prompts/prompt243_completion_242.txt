  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is initially undefined, but becomes an object after the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string, so the comparison would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for `resolvedPromise`, but it is not the same as `undefined`.

DONE.
