  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.clear()` would remove all entries from the map, while `.delete()` would only remove the entry for the given key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.size = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `.size` is a read-only property of a map, so attempting to assign a value to it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(urlMap.keys[urlMap.size - 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `.keys[urlMap.size - 1]` would return the key of the last entry in the map, and `.delete(key)` would remove that entry from the map.

DONE.
