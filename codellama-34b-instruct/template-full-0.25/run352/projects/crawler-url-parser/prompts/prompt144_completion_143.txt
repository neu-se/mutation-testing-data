  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different pattern in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]+\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different pattern in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[^\/]+\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different pattern in the URL and the `i` flag would make the match case-insensitive.

DONE.
