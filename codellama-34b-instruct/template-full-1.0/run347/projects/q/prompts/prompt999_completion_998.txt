  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on a different object, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).nodeify(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeify` method would be called on a different object, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name], nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on a different object with different arguments, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
