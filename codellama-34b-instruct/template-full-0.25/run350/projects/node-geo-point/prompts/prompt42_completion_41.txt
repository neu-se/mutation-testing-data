  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos` is the cosine function, which has a different output than `sin` for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(point2Rad)` is the sine of the `point2Rad` variable, which is different from `sin` of the `point1Rad` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan(point2Rad)` is the tangent of the `point2Rad` variable, which is different from `sin` of the `point1Rad` variable.

DONE.
