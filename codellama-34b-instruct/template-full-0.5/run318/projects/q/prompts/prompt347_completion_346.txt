  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` could be a function or any other non-null value, while `typeof rejected === "function"` would only be true if `rejected` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` could be any value, while `typeof rejected === "function"` would only be true if `rejected` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` could be an empty array, while `typeof rejected === "function"` would only be true if `rejected` is a function.

DONE.
