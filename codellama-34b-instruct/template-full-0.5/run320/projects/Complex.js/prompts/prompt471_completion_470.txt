  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if it is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to zero, while this new code fragment checks if it is less than zero.

DONE.
