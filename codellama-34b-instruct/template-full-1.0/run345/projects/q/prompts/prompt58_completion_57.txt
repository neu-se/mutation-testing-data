  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !=== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for a function that is not defined instead of one that is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for a function that is not defined instead of one that is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for a number instead of a function.

DONE.
