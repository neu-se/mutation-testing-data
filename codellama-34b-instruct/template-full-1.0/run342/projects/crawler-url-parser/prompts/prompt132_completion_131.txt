  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to be applied globally, rather than just at the end of the string. This would cause any instances of the pattern to be replaced, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to be case-insensitive, so it would match both lowercase and uppercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\default.[a-z]+$/s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause the regular expression to be applied to the string as a single line, rather than as multiple lines. This would cause the pattern
