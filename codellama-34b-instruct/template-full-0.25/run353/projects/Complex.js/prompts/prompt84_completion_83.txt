  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with an error code of 1, whereas the original code would not exit the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with an error code of 0, whereas the original code would not exit the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to exit with an error code of 2, whereas the original code would not exit the program.

DONE.
