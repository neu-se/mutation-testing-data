  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is converted to uppercase, which could cause issues if the key is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is converted to lowercase, which could cause issues if the key is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is trimmed, which could cause issues if the key is not a string.

DONE.
