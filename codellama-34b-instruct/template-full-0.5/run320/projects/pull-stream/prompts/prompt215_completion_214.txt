  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `next` function with the `err` and `cb` arguments, while the new code fragment calls the `cb` function directly with the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `next` function with the `err` and `cb` arguments, while the new code fragment calls the `cb` function directly with the `err` and `data` arguments.

DONE.
