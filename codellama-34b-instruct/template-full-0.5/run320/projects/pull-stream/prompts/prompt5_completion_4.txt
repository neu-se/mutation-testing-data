  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the order of the `throughs` array to be reversed, which could potentially break any code that relies on the original order of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a new array that is missing the first element of the original `throughs` array, which could potentially break any code that relies on that element being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.concat(['newThrough'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add a new element to the `throughs` array, which could potentially break any code that relies on the array having a specific length or content.

DONE.
