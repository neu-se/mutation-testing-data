  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is used to convert an object to a JSON string, while `JSON.parse` is used to parse a JSON string and convert it to an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is used to convert an object to a JSON string, while `String(key)` is used to convert a key to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` is used to convert an object to a JSON string, while `key + ''` is used to concatenate a key with an empty string.

DONE.
