  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be returning the cosine of the angle instead of the sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be returning the tangent of the angle instead of the sine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be returning the arcsine of the angle instead of the sine.

DONE.
