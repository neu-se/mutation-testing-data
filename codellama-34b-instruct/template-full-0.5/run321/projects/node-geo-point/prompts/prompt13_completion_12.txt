  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for more than two elements in the `coordinates` array, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an empty `coordinates` array, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2 && point.coordinates.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for any number of elements in the `coordinates` array, as long as it is not equal to 2 or 0.

DONE.
