  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `newOp.delete` is a string, but it should be checking if it's a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `lastOp.delete` is a string, but it should be checking if it's a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'boolean' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking if `newOp.delete` is a boolean, but it should be checking if it's a number.

DONE.
