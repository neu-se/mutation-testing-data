  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test Error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute normally, while the modified code would throw an error and stop execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute the rest of the function, while the modified code would return immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute the rest of the function, while the modified code would return undefined.

DONE.
