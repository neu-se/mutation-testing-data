  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` uses the comma operator, which evaluates both `a` and `b` and returns `b`, while the new code fragment `a + b` returns the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` uses the comma operator, which evaluates both `a` and `b` and returns `b`, while the new code fragment `a * b` returns the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a, b` uses the comma operator, which evaluates both `a` and `b` and returns `b`, while the new code fragment `a - b` returns the difference of `a` and `b
