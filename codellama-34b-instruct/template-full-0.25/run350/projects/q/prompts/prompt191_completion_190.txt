  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match the column number in the stack trace, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):\d+:\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match the line and column numbers in the stack trace, which are not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(.+):(\d+):\d+:\d+:\d+$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match the line, column, and character numbers in the stack trace, which are not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
