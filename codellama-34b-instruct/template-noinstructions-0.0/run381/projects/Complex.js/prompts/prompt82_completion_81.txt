  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === 'j'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for 'i' or 'I', but the new code also checks for 'j', which is not a valid imaginary unit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for 'i' or 'I', but the new code also checks for 'e', which is not a valid imaginary unit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i' || c === 'I' || c === 'π'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for 'i' or 'I', but the new code also checks for 'π', which is not a valid imaginary unit.

DONE.
