 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function, which is a polyfill for `Array.prototype.slice` that can handle array-like objects and nodelist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments).slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an array of the keys of the arguments object and then slices it, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function, which can handle array-like objects and nodelist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by concatenating all the arguments passed, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function, which is a polyfill for
