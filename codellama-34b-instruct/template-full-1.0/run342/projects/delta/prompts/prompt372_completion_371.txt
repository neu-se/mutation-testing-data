  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result of `Op.length`, potentially resulting in an incorrect index being used for the newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `Op.length`, potentially resulting in an incorrect index being used for the newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the logic to always enter the `else` block, potentially resulting in the function returning `true` when it should return `false`.

DONE.
