 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `options.dest` is an empty string instead of checking if it's an absolute path. This could cause issues if the `options.dest` is an empty string, and the code might resolve the destination to an unexpected directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.win32.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for absolute paths only in the Windows file system, while the original code checks for absolute paths in all file systems. This could cause issues if the code is executed on a non-Windows system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fs.existsSync(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the destination path exists instead of checking if the path is absolute. This could cause issues if the destination path exists but is not an absolute path, and the
