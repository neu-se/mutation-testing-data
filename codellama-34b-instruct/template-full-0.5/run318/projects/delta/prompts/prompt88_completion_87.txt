  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider objects of any type as valid insertions, whereas the original code only considers strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider numbers as valid insertions, whereas the original code only considers strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert instanceof String &&
          lastOp.insert instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider instances of the String class as valid insertions, whereas the original code considers any value of the insert property that is a string.

DONE.
