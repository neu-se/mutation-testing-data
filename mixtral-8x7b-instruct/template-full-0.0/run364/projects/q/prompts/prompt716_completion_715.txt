 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` value set to the provided value, which in this case is the instance of `Promise`. The original code fragment, `this.dispatch`, relies on the dynamic `this` value determined by how the method is called. By using `bind`, we are changing the behavior of the method to always use the `Promise` instance as the `this` value, which may not be what was intended in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch.call(null)
