  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` and `match` are different methods in JavaScript's `String` class, and they have different return values. While `match` returns an array of all matches, `search` returns the index of the first match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a method that replaces a portion of a string with a new value, while `match` and `search` are methods that search for a match in a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a method that splits a string into an array of substrings, while `match` and `search` are methods that search for a match in a string.

DONE.
