  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `base` array with a length of 1, whereas the original code fragment returns a slice of the `base` array with a length of `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `base` array with a length of `length`, whereas the original code fragment returns a slice of the `base` array with a length of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `base` array with a length of 2, whereas the original code fragment returns a slice of the `base` array with a length of 1.

DONE.
