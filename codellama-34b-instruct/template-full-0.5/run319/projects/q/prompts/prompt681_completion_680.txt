  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `apply` method would be an array of length one shorter than the original, which could cause the function to be applied with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `apply` method would be an array of length two shorter than the original, which could cause the function to be applied with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `apply` method would be an array of length three shorter than the original, which could cause the function to be applied with the wrong number of arguments.
