  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` is a different way of calling the `array_slice` function, which would change the way the arguments are processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(null, arguments)` is a different way of calling the `array_slice` function, which would change the way the arguments are processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice.call(arguments, 1)` is a different way of calling the `slice` function, which would change the way the arguments are processed.

DONE.
