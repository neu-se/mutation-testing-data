  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This change will cause the `logHypot` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This change will also cause the `logHypot` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This change will cause the `logHypot` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
