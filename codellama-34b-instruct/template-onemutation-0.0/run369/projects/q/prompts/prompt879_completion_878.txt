  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method expects a function as its first argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the method to throw an error, which would be caught by the `fail` method and the promise would be rejected.

DONE.
