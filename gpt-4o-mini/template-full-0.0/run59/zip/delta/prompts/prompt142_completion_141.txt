Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to allow one more operation than intended, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operations when composing two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>) < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the comparison, allowing the loop to continue when it should stop, which could lead to incorrect operations being added to the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the expected retain count, which may cause the algorithm to skip necessary operations or incorrectly process the remaining operations in the delta.

DONE.
