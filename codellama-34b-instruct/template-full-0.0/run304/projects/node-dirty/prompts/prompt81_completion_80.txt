  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error('Custom error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a new error with a custom message, rather than the original error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null error, rather than the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an undefined error, rather than the original error.

DONE.
