 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the `null` value, whereas the original code checks for falsy values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(country).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `country` object is empty, rather than just checking if the `country` variable is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `country` is of the `undefined` type, rather than checking if it is falsy.

These changes introduce new behavior that differs from the original code, which makes it more likely that the test suite will catch these issues. By introducing these changes, the developers can identify gaps in their test suite and improve it accordingly.

DONE.
