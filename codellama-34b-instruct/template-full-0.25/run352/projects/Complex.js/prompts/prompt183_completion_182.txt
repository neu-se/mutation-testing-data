  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the if statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if the imaginary part is equal to 0. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the if statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
