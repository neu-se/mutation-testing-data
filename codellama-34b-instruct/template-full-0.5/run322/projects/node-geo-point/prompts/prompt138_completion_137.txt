  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude value, which would change the calculated destination and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the latitude value by 2, which would change the calculated distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the longitude value, which would change the calculated destination and bearing.

DONE.
