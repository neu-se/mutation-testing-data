  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with a single argument that was always `null`, while this new code fragment calls it with a different argument each time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the `cb` function with a single argument that was always `null`, while this new code fragment calls it with a different argument each time.

DONE.
