 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.next.bind(null)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls `thisIter.next()` without a context, which may cause errors or unexpected behavior if `thisIter` is required within the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.prototype.shift.call(thisIter)
