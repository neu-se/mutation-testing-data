  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a function as the third argument, and therefore the progress callback would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a function as the third argument, and therefore the progress callback would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the progress callback would be executed, but it would not have any effect on the behavior of the code.

DONE.
