  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second argument instead of the first, potentially causing the function to skip over important arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last argument instead of the first, potentially causing the function to skip over important arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle argument instead of the first, potentially causing the function to skip over important arguments.

DONE.
