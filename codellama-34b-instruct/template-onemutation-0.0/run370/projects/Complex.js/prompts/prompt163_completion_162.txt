  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()`, which means that if both `this` and `z` are infinite, the result will be `Complex['INFINITY']`, whereas the new code fragment will return `Complex['NAN']` if both `this` and `z` are infinite.
