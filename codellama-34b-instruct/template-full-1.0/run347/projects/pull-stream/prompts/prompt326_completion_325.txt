  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would now be called with two arguments instead of one, which would potentially change its behavior and cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd && once(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would now be called only if it is truthy, which could cause the `once` function to not be called in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onEnd` function would now be called with only one argument, which could cause it to behave differently than it would with two arguments.

DONE.
