  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would return the plural form of the word "dice" (i.e., "dice"). However, the new code fragment is `'die'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die" (i.e., "dies").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would return the plural form of the word "dice" (i.e., "dice"). However, the new code fragment is `'dice' + 's'`, which would return the plural form of the word "dice" (i.e., "dices").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
