  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because now the callback function will always return `value + 1`, instead of just `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because now the callback function will always return `undefined`, instead of just `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because now the callback function will always return the value of `this`, instead of just `value`.

DONE.
