  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different event, "rejectionHandled", which may not be handled by the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the same event, "unhandledRejection", but with different arguments, which may not be handled correctly by the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different event, "rejectionHandled", which may not be handled by the application.

DONE.
