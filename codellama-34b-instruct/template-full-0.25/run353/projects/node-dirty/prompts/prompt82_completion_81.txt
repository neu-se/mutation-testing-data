  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means that the chunk does not contain any newlines. In contrast, the new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is greater than -1, which means that the chunk contains at least one newline.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === chunk.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is -1, which means that the chunk does not contain any newlines. In contrast, the new code fragment checks if the last index of '\n' is equal to the length of the chunk minus 1, which means that the chunk ends with a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === chunk.indexOf('\n')
