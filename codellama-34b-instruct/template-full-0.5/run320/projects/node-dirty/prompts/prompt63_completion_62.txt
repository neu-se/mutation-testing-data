  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.end()` would immediately close the write stream, causing any subsequent writes to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.destroy()` would immediately destroy the write stream, causing any subsequent writes to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream.cork()` would prevent any writes from being flushed to the underlying system, causing the write stream to become stuck.

DONE.
