  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the map, whereas the original code fragment would retrieve the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key + 'suffix')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the value associated with a different key than the one passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, () => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key to undefined and pass an empty function as a callback, whereas the original code fragment would not pass a callback.

DONE.
