  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not a valid method for the `OpIterator` class, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not a valid method for the `OpIterator` class, and would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is not a valid method for the `OpIterator` class, and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
