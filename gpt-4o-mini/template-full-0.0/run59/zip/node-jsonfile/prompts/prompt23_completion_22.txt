Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 'extra data'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends additional data to the content string, which would cause the JSON parsing to fail if the original content was valid JSON.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the content to uppercase, which would likely result in a JSON parsing error if the original content was valid JSON, as JSON keys and values are case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the content with `null`, which would cause the JSON parsing to throw an error since `null` is not a valid JSON string to parse into an object.

DONE.
