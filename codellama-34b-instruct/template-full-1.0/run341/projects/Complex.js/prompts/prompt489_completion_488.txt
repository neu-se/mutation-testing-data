  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `false` instead of `true`, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `null` instead of `true`, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': NaN }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `NaN` instead of `true`, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

DONE.
