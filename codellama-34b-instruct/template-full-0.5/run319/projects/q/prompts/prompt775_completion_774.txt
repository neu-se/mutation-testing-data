  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is used to create a promise that resolves with the value of another promise, whereas `Q` is used to create a promise that resolves with the value of the current promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object, whereas `Q` creates a new promise.

DONE.
