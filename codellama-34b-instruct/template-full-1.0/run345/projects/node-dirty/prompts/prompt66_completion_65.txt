  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method is called immediately, which could lead to data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all the callbacks from the queue, which could prevent any further writes from being made to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the number of in-flight writes to 0, which could cause the write stream to be considered empty even if there are still writes in progress.

DONE.
