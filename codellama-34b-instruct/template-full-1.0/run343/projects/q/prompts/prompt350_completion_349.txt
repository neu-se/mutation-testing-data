  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(reject, "when", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally reject the promise, regardless of the original fulfilled or rejected state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error synchronously, potentially causing the promise to be rejected without going through the normal rejection process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.notify(newValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise of progress, potentially causing the promise to be rejected if the rejection handler is not set.

DONE.
