  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the `stream` variable, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the `stream` variable, while `undefined` is an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the `stream` variable, while `0` is a numeric value.

DONE.
