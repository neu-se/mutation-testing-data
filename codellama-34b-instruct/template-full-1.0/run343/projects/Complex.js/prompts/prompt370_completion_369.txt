  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by zero, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would subtract the real component from the imaginary component, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would add one to the real component, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
