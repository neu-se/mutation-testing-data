  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.domain` is a string representing the domain of the URL, while `ret.host` is a string representing the hostname of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.path` is a string representing the path of the URL, while `ret.host` is a string representing the hostname of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the URL, while `ret.host` is a string representing the hostname of the URL.

DONE.
