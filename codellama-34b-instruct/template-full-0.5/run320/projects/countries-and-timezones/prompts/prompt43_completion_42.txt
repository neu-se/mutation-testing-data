  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` and `getCountry` have different return values, and `getTimezone` may return a timezone object with a different structure than the country object returned by `getCountry`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: buildCountry(data, id) }
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` returns a new country object, rather than retrieving an existing one from the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: countries[id] }
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id]` is a reference to the country object stored in the `countries` object, rather than a new country object created by `buildCountry`.

DONE.
