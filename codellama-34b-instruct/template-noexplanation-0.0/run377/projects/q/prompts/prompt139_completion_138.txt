  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.source
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the `source` property of the `promise` object, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.then
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the `then` method of the `promise` object, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.catch
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate over the `catch` method of the `promise` object, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
