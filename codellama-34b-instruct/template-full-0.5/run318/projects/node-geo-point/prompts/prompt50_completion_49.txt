  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deg2rad(Δλ)`, which converts the longitude difference from degrees to radians. Using `rad2deg(Δλ)` instead would convert the longitude difference from radians to degrees, which would give a different result in the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `sin(Δλ)`, which gives the sine of the longitude difference. Using `cos(Δλ)` instead would give the cosine of the longitude difference, which would give a different result in the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r)`, which gives the arccosine of the ratio of the distance to the Earth's
