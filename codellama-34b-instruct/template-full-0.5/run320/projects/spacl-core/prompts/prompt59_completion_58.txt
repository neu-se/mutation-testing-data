  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash in the replacement string is escaped, causing the replacement to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash in the replacement string is not escaped, causing the replacement to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '$$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string uses double dollar signs instead of single dollar signs, causing the replacement to be incorrect.

DONE.
