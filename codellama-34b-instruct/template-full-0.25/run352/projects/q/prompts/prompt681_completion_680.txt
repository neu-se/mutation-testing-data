  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object instead of the promise object, which could cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the wrong object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the first argument of the `apply` method to be omitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the first argument of the `apply` method to be omitted.

DONE.
