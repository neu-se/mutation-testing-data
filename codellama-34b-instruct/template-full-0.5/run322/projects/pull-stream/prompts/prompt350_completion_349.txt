  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` variable is no longer defined, and the `test` function would throw an error when trying to access its `test` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` variable is no longer defined, and the `prop` function would throw an error when trying to access its `prop` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test.test` method is no longer defined, and the `prop` function would throw an error when trying to call it.

DONE.
