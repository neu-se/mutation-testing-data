  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    return void 0;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    throw new Error("test");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error instead of resolving with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function() {
    return Q.reject(new Error("test"));
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error instead of resolving with the original value.

DONE.
