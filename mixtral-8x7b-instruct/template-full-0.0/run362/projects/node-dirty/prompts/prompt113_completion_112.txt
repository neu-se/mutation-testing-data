 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.emit('load', this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which might not have access to the same context as the original `this.emit('load', this._data.size)` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit('loaded', this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'loaded' event instead of the original 'load' event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit('load', 'not a size')
