  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!mapper` would evaluate to `true` if `mapper` is a falsy value (such as `null` or `undefined`), while the new code fragment `mapper === null` would only evaluate to `true` if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!mapper` would evaluate to `false` if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`, while the new code fragment `mapper !== null` would evaluate to `true` if `mapper` is not strictly equal to `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!mapper` would evaluate to `true` if `mapper` is `undefined`, while the
