  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"!="
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would now split the string on every character that is not equal to the given separator, rather than every occurrence of the separator itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would now split the string on every occurrence of the plus sign, rather than every occurrence of the separator itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"*"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would now split the string on every occurrence of the asterisk, rather than every occurrence of the separator itself.

DONE.
