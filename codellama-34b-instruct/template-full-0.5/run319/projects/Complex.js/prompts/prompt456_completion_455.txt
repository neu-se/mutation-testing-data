  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']()) {
  return 'Infinity';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return 'Infinity', regardless of the value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || this['isNaN']()) {
  return 'Infinity';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return 'Infinity' for both infinite and NaN values, rather than just infinite values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['isNaN']()) {
  return 'Infinity';
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return 'Infinity' only for infinite and NaN values, rather than for any complex number that is not on the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
