  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` will return `true` for any finite number, whilst `Number.isFinite` will return `false` for any non-finite number (including `NaN`, `Infinity`, and `-Infinity`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` will return `true` if the value is a safe integer, which means it is an integer that can be exactly represented as a double precision number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` will return the absolute value of the argument, whereas `Number.isFinite` will check if the argument is a finite number.

DONE.
