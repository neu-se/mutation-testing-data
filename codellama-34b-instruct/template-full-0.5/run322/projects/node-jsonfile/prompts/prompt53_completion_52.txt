  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `replacer`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `replacer` by 2, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `replacer` is a function, and calling `toString()` on it would return the function's source code, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
