 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object(object)` creates a new object wrapper around the original object, which might not have the expected `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.dispatch
