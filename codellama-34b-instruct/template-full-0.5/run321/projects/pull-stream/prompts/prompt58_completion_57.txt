  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done || false` is always `false`, whereas `!done` is `true` if `done` is not defined or is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done && true` is always `true`, whereas `!done` is `false` if `done` is not defined or is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `done && false` is always `false`, whereas `!done` is `true` if `done` is not defined or is `false`.

DONE.
