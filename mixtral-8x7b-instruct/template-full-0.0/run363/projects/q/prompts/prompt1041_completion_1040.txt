 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.resolve` function would be set to `null`, making it impossible to resolve the `next` deferred object. This could cause the queue to stop functioning correctly, as items may not be added properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve.bind(ends)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `put` method to always use the same `resolve` function, regardless of the value being added to the queue. This could cause issues if the `ends` deferred object is resolved multiple times, as it would only trigger the callback once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { next.resolve(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the `next` deferred object, rather than waiting for the `put` method to be called. This could cause the queue to become corrupted, as items may be added
