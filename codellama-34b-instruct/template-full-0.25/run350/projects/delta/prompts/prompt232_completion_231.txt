  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation. By adding 1 to the result of `peekLength()`, we are effectively skipping over the next operation in the iterator, which could cause the `diff` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation. By subtracting 1 from the result of `peekLength()`, we are effectively going back one operation in the iterator, which could cause the `diff` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
