  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to start from the next index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `slice` method to start from the previous index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `slice` method to start from twice the current index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

DONE.
