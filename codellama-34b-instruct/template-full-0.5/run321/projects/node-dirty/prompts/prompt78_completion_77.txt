  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('This is a buggy error message'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message emitted by the `emit` method, which could cause issues for the application that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the error message from the `emit` method, which could cause issues for the application that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(key));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message emitted by the `emit` method to include the key that caused the error, which could cause issues for the application that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
