  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only executes `op` if `data` is truthy, while this new code executes `op` if `data` is truthy and `op` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only executes `op` if `data` is falsy, while this new code executes `op` if `data` is falsy or `op` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op ^ data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only executes `op` if `data` is falsy, while this new code executes `op` if `data` is falsy or `op` is falsy, and also if `data` is truthy and `op` is truthy.

DONE.
