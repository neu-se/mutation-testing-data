  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port1` and `port2` are different MessagePort objects, and `postMessage` is a method that sends a message to the port's corresponding MessageChannel. In this case, `port1` is the port that is used for sending messages, while `port2` is the port that is used for receiving messages. Using `port1` instead of `port2` would cause the message to be sent to the wrong port, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
