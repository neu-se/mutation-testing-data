  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspect();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined in the `Promise` constructor, so this would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error("Promise does not support operation: " + op));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not defined in the `Promise` constructor, so this would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(descriptor[op]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function is not defined in the `Promise` constructor, so this would cause a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

DONE.
