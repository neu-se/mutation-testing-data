  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would cause an error when `cb` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would not have the same side effects as the original `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, function() { return end; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function would return `end`, which is not the same as the original `cb` function, which returns `data`.

DONE.
