  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = null
```
This would result in different behavior because plural function would return a null value when called on a String object, which would be different from the original functionality where it returns the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because plural function will not be defined on String objects, which would cause errors when attempting to use it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = "not a function"
```
This would result in different behavior because plural function would return a string value of "not a function" instead of the plural form of the word, which would cause errors when attempting to use it.

DONE.
