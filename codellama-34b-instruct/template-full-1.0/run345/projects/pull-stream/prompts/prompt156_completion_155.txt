  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to short-circuit and always execute the `else` branch, whereas the original code fragment would only short-circuit in the case of `value` being a null or undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always execute the `then` branch, whereas the original code fragment would only do so in the case of `value` being a null or undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to short-circuit and always execute the `else` branch, whereas the original code fragment would only short-circuit in the case of `value` being a null or undefined value.

DONE.
