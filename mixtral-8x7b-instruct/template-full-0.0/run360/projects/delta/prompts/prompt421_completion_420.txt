 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` value will no longer be adjusted based on the length of the deleted operations, potentially causing incorrect position transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` value will always be adjusted based on the length of the next operation, even if it's not a delete operation, potentially causing incorrect position transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` value will be adjusted by a fixed amount (1), regardless of the length of the deleted operations or the next operation, potentially causing incorrect position transformations.

DONE.
