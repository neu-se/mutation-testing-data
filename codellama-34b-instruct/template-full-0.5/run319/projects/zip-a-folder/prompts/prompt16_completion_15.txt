  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `X_OK` constant checks for execute permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for read and write permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `X_OK` constant checks for execute permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for read and write permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK | fs.constants.F_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `F_OK` constant checks
