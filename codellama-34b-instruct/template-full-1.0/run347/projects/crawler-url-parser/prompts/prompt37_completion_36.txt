  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would not be parsing the URL correctly, leading to incorrect results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false && parsedUrl.host != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the second operand to be evaluated only if the first operand is truthy, leading to a different evaluation result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the comparison, leading to different results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
