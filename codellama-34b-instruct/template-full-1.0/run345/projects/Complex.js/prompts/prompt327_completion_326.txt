  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` and `Math.cos()` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * a` and `Math.cos()` have different outputs for the same input.

DONE.
