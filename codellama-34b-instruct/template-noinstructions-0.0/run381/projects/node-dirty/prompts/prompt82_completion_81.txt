  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the last occurrence of '\n' is at the beginning of the chunk, rather than checking if there are any occurrences of '\n' in the chunk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the last occurrence of '\n' is after the first character of the chunk, rather than checking if there are any occurrences of '\n' in the chunk.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === chunk.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the last occurrence of '\n' is at the end of the chunk, rather than checking if there are any occurrences of '\n' in the chunk.

DONE.
