  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the hostname of the base URL, which may not be the same as the hostname of the current URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pathname of the base URL, which may not be the same as the pathname of the current URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the search query of the base URL, which may not be the same as the search query of the current URL.

DONE.
