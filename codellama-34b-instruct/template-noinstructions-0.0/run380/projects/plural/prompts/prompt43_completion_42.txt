  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this replacement subtracts only 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in -us to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this replacement does not subtract anything. This would cause the plural form of words that end in -us to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 2 from the length of the word, while this replacement adds 1. This would cause the plural form of words that end in -us to be incorrect.

DONE.
