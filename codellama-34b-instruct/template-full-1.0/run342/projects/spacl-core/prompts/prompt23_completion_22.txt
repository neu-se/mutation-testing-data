  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `string` variable to 1, which would cause the regex matcher to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `string` variable to `undefined`, which would cause the regex matcher to throw an error when trying to access its `length` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `string` variable to `null`, which would cause the regex matcher to behave differently when trying to match the input string against the regular expression.

DONE.
