  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atReport` variable would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to be spliced at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length - atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atReport` variable would be subtracted from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array's length, which would cause the `splice` method to be called with a negative index, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atReport` variable would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to be spliced at the wrong index.

DONE.
