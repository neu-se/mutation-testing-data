  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude and latitude of the two points are swapped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + point.latitude, this.longitude + point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude of the two points are added together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * point.latitude, this.longitude * point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude of the two points are multiplied together.

DONE.
