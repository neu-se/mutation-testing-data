  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add the offset to the index, regardless of whether the offset is greater than the index or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract the index from the offset, regardless of whether the offset is greater than the index or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(index - offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute difference between the index and the offset, regardless of whether the offset is greater than the index or not.

DONE.
