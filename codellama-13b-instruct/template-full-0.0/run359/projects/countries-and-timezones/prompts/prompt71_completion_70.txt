  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is an empty object, which would cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, { foo: 'bar' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is an object with a property `foo` set to `'bar'`, which would cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, { foo: 'bar', baz: 'qux' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is an object with two properties `foo` and `baz`, which would cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
