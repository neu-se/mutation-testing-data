  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fail` is not a valid method in the Q library, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would reject the promise returned by `Q.async` instead of resolving it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would resolve the promise returned by `Q.async` immediately, instead of waiting for the generator function to finish executing.

DONE.
