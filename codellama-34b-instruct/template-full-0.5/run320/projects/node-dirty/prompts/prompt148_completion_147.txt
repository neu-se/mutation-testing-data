  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment `cbs` refers to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(cb => cb !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(cb => cb !== null)` filters out any null values from the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment `cbs` refers to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.map(cb => cb.bind(this))
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.map(cb => cb.bind(this))` creates a new array of bound functions, whereas the original code fragment `cbs` refers to the original array of unbound functions.

DONE.
