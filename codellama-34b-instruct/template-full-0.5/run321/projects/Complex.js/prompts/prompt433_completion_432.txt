  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of `this['im'] * places`, which would cause the `Math.floor` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of `this['im'] * places`, which would cause the `Math.floor` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of `this['im'] * places` by 2, which would cause the `Math.floor` function to return a different value.

DONE.
