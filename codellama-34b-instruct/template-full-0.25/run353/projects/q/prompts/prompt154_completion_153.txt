  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + "From previous event:" + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator is now hardcoded and not generated dynamically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR.toLowerCase() + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator is now in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR.split("").reverse().join("") + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator is now reversed.

DONE.
