 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'latitude' in object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'latitude' property exists in the object, rather than checking if the property is the object's own property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.has(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Reflect API to check for the property, which might not behave the same way as the `hasOwnProperty` method in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'latitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly calls the `hasOwnProperty` method from the object's prototype, which might not have the same behavior as the one defined directly on the object.

DONE.
