Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && !currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrl` is truthy and if `currentUrl.url` is falsy, which would allow the code to proceed even when `currentUrl` is defined but has no valid URL, potentially leading to incorrect processing of links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl || currentUrl.url === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the condition, allowing the code to execute if `currentUrl` is falsy or if `currentUrl.url` is an empty string, which would skip valid URLs that should be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of `currentUrl.host` instead of `currentUrl.url`, which could lead to valid URLs being ignored if they do not have a host defined, thus affecting the extraction of links.

DONE.
