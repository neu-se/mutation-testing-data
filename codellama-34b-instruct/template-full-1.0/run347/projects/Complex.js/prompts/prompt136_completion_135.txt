  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the boolean value returned by `isInfinite()`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` is a different method that checks whether a number is a finite value, whereas `isInfinite()` checks whether a number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` checks whether the complex number is closer to zero than 1e-14, whereas `isInfinite()` checks whether the complex number has an infinite value.

DONE.
