 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the conditions, which could lead to unexpected results in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isNaN']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for NaN instead of zero, which would cause the division to return Infinity or NaN in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operator from OR to AND, which would cause the division to return NaN in certain edge cases.

DONE.
