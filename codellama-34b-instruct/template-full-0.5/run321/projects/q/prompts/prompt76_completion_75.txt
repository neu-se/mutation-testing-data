  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = flush;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event would be fired every time a message is sent to the port, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function() {
  flush();
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event would be fired every time a message is sent to the port, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.onmessage = function() {
  setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event would be fired every time a message is sent to the port, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
