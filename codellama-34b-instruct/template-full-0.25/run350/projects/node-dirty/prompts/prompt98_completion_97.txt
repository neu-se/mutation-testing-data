  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the error message would be emitted as a warning instead of an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, as the event name is the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the error message would be emitted as an informational message instead of an error.

DONE.
