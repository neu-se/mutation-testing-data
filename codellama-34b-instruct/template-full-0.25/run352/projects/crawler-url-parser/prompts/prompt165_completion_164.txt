  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of strings, and the `pop` method returns the last element of the array. In the original code, the `includes` method is called on the `pageurl_path` string, which would return `true` if the `linkurl_path` string is a substring of `pageurl_path`. However, if we replace `pageurl_path` with an array of strings, the `includes` method would return `false` even if the `linkurl_path` string is a substring of one of the array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\//g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with all occurrences of the specified pattern (in this case, a forward slash) replaced with the specified replacement string (in this case, an empty string). In the original code, the `includes`
