  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation instead of the current operation, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test to fail if the code is correct, as the attributes of the operation would be null, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test to fail if the code is correct, as the attributes of the operation would be undefined, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
