  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` when the array is empty, while the new code fragment returns `false`. This change would cause the function to return a different value when the input array is empty, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.
