  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is not called, and the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because an exception is thrown, which is not handled by the `rejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("test rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise is returned, which is not handled by the `rejected` function.

DONE.
