  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all <a> elements instead of the <base> element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the href attribute of all <a> elements instead of the <base> element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the href property of all <a> elements instead of the <base> element.

DONE.
