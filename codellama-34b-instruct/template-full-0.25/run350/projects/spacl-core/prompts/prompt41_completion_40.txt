  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a backslash character instead of a forward slash, which could cause the regular expression to fail to match the expected input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a forward slash character instead of a backslash character, which could cause the regular expression to fail to match the expected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a backslash character followed by a forward slash character, which could cause the regular expression to fail to match the expected input.

DONE.
