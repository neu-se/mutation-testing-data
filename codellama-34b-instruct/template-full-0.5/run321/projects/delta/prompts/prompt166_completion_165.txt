  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, which could be 'insert', 'delete', or 'retain', whereas `thisIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the type of the current operation in the iterator, which could be 'insert', 'delete', or 'retain' as well.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType()` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, which could be 'insert', 'delete', or 'retain', whereas `otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>)` would return the type of the current operation in the iterator, which could be 'insert', 'delete', or 'retain' as well.

Option 3: The PLACE
