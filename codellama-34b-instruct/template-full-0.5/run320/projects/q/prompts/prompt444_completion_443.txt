  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("unhandled rejection"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, which would be handled by the `process.emit` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the reason, which would not be handled by the `process.emit` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return reason; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the reason, which would not be handled by the `process.emit` function.

DONE.
