  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i--]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the next element in the array instead of the current element, causing the function to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at the current index multiplied by 2, causing the function to return the wrong value.

DONE.
