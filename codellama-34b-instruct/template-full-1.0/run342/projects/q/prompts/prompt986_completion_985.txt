  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method to send a request, whereas replacing it with "get" would send a request using the "get" method instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method to send a request, whereas replacing it with "head" would send a request using the "head" method instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method to send a request, whereas replacing it with "put" would send a request using the "put" method instead.

DONE.
