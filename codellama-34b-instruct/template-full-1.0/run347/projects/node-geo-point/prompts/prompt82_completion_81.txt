  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ > 1) return 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `1`, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ < -1) return -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `-1`, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (sinφ1 * cosδ + cosφ1 * sinδ * cosθ > 0) return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return `0`, regardless of the input coordinates.

DONE.
