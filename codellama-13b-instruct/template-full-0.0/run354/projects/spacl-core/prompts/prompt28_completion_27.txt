  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Matcher` class would not throw an error when the path contains invalid characters, which would allow for the creation of a malicious path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Matcher` class would not throw an error when the path does not begin with a slash, which would allow for the creation of a malicious path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Matcher` class would not throw an error when the path contains empty segments, which would allow for the creation of a malicious path.

DONE.
