  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` should only be used to print error messages to the console, whereas `this.emit` is used to emit an event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.log` would not emit an event, it would only log it to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.foo` is not a valid method, it would throw an exception.

DONE.
