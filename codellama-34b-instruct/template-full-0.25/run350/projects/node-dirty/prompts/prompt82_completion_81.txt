  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the newline character is at the beginning of the chunk, rather than checking if it is present at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the newline character is present in the chunk, but not at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') === chunk.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the newline character is at the end of the chunk, rather than checking if it is present at all.

DONE.
