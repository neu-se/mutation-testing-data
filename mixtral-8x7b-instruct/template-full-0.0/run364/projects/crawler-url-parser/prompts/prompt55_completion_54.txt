 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a fixed absolute URL instead of using the parsed base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `href` property instead of the `format` method, which may produce a different string representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.format(absoluteUrl, result_normalize_options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies the `result_normalize_options` to the absolute URL, which may change its representation.

DONE.
