  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `<PLACEHOLDER>` argument, which is not used in the new code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `<PLACEHOLDER>` argument, which is not used in the new code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](-1)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `<PLACEHOLDER>` argument, which is not used in the new code fragment.

DONE.
