  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a deferred object, whereas `Q` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall` returns a promise for the result of calling the given function with the given arguments, whereas `Q` returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

DONE.
