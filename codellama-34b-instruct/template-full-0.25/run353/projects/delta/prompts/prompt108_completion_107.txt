  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => !predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is negated, causing the filter function to return the opposite of what it would have returned with the original predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index) && index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to only return true for even-indexed elements, causing the filter function to return a subset of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => predicate(op, index) || index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function is modified to return true for the first element, causing the filter function to return a different subset of the original array.

DONE.
