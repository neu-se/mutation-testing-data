  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset > index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is less than the index, but this replacement checks if the offset is greater than the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset !== index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is less than or equal to the index, but this replacement checks if the offset is not equal to the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert' && (offset + length > index || !priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the offset is less than or equal to the index, but this replacement checks if the offset plus the length is greater than the index.

DONE.
