  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].name, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id].name` is a string, whereas `countries[id]` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].timezones, options
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[id].timezones` is an array, whereas `countries[id]` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[id], options
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezones[id]` is an object, whereas `countries[id]` is an object.

DONE.
