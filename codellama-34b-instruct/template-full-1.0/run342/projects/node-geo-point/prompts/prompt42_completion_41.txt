  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `sin` function to calculate the distance between two points, while the new code fragment would not perform any calculation and would return `none` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(Math.PI);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `sin` function to calculate the distance between two points, while the new code fragment would calculate the distance between the points using the cosine function with an argument of `Math.PI`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radius * Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `sin` function to calculate the distance between two points, while the new code fragment would calculate the distance between the points by multiplying the radius by `Math.PI`.

DONE.
