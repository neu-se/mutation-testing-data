  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1/0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw a division by zero error, causing the function to fail and return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id, options) + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the country object and an empty object, which would be a different reference from the original value returned by `getCountry`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name) + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a concatenation of the timezone object and an empty object, which would be a different reference from the original value returned by `getTimezone`.

DONE.
