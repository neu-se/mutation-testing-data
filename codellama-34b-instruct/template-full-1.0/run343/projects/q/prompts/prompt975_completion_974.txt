  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array().slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a copy of the portion of an array into a new array object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while the `[].slice` syntax is a shorthand for creating a new array from a specified portion of an existing array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while the `Array.slice` syntax is a shorthand for creating a new array from a specified portion of an existing array.

DONE.
