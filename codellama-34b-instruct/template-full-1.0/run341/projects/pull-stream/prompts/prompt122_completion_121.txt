  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `source` function is not being called, and the `sink` function will not receive any data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and it will cause the `reducer` function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value in JavaScript that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable, and it will cause the `sink` function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
