  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first two arguments of the `arguments` object, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument of the `arguments` object, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the third argument of the `arguments` object, rather than all of them.

DONE.
