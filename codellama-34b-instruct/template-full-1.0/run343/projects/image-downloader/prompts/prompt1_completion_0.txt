  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `url` property in the `options` object, while this code checks for the absence of the `url` property. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!utils.hasAnyKeys(options, ['url'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the operator `!` to check if the `url` is truthy, while this code uses the `hasAnyKeys` function from the `utils` module to check if the `url` property exists in the `options` object. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(options, 'url')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `in` operator to check if the `url` property exists in the `options` object, while this code uses the `hasOwnProperty` method on
