 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[1], ref[2], ref[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially causing unexpected results if the function relies on the order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[0], ref[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the second element of the `ref` array, potentially causing the `pull` function to receive incomplete data and produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an undefined value to the argument list, potentially causing the `pull` function to handle an unexpected number of arguments and produce incorrect results.

DONE.
