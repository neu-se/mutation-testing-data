Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is infinite instead of checking if it is zero, which would lead to incorrect results when dividing by an infinite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for zero, meaning that the condition would pass when the number is not zero, potentially leading to incorrect handling of division by zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if the real part of the complex number is zero, ignoring the imaginary part, which could lead to incorrect results when the complex number is purely imaginary.

DONE.
