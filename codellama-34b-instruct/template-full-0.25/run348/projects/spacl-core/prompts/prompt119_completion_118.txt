  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the path to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the path matches the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the path starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the path matches the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[a-z]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove all lowercase letters from the path, which could potentially cause the `matches()` method to return `false` even if the path matches the regular expression.

DONE.
