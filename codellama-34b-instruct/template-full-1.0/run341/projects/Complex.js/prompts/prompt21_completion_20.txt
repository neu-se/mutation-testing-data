  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return < 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the square of the hypotenuse is greater than or equal to 3000, but this alternative code checks if the square of the hypotenuse is strictly less than 3000. This means that the alternative code would not trigger the same branch of the conditional statement when the square of the hypotenuse is exactly equal to 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the square of the hypotenuse is greater than or equal to 3000, but this alternative code checks if the square of the hypotenuse plus 1 is greater than or equal to 3000. This means that the alternative code would not trigger the same branch of the conditional statement when the square of the hypotenuse is exactly 3000.

Option 3
