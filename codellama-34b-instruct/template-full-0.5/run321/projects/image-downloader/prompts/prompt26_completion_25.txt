  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get()
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.get()` returns a promise that resolves with the response object, whereas `request` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the response body.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.post()
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.post()` sends a POST request, whereas `request` sends a GET request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request.get('https://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because `request.get('https://example.com')` sends a GET request to a different URL than `request`.

DONE.
