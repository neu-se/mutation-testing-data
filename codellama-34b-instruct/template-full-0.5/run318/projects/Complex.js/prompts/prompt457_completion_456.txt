  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if the number is not a number, whereas `isInfinite()` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] !== 0` checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to zero, whereas `this['isInfinite']()` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] === 0` checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to zero, whereas `this['isInfinite']()` checks if the number is at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
