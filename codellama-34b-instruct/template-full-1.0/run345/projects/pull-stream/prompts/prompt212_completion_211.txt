  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```abortCb()```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```var callback```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a different variable than `abortCb`, which is not defined anywhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```function()```
This would result in different behavior because it would declare a new function, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
