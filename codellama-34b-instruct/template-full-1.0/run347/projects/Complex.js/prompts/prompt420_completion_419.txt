  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now always return `Complex.INFINITY`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Math.random() > 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now return `Complex.INFINITY` randomly, rather than only when `this['isZero']()` returns `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['re'] !== 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will now only return `Complex.INFINITY` when the real part of the complex number is not zero, rather than when the complex number itself is zero.

DONE.
