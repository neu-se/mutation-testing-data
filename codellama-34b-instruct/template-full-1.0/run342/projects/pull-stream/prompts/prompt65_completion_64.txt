  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to `done()` would be different. In the original code, the arguments passed to `done()` are `null` or `end`, depending on whether `end` is `true` or not. In the mutated code, the arguments passed to `done()` are always `null`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end !== true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition used to determine whether to pass `null` or `end` to `done()` would be reversed. In the original code, `done()` is called with `null` if `end` is `true`, and with `end` if it is not `true`. In the mutated code, `done()` is called with `null` if `end` is not `true`, and with `end` if it is `true`.

Option 3: The PL
