  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword would refer to the global object, instead of the promise object, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` keyword would refer to the global object, instead of the promise object, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.unshift(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to the function, instead of the promise object, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
