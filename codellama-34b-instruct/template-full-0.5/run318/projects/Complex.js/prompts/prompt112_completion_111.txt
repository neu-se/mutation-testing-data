  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is different from the `im` property, and would cause the `sub` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the `sub` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `sub` method to return a different result.

DONE.
