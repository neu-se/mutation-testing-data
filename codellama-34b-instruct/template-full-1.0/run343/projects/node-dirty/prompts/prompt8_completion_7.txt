  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```fragment != val```
This would result in different behavior because using the inequality operator `!=` instead of the equality operator `==` will ensure that the code fragment is not equal to the original `val` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```fragment + val```
This would result in different behavior because adding `val` to the `fragment` value will cause the `set()` method to produce a different result than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Number(fragment)```
This would result in different behavior because converting the `fragment` value to a number using the `Number()` function will cause the `set()` method to produce a different result than the original.

DONE.
