  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let part
```
This would result in different behavior because `part` is now a variable and not a constant, which could cause issues in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `part` is now a constant with a value of 1, which could cause issues in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = "hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `part` is now a constant with a value of "hello", which could cause issues in the code that uses it.

DONE.
