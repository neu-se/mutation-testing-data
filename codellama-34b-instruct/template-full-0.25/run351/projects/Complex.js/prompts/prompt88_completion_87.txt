  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next token instead of using the next token as the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the previous token as the imaginary part instead of the next token.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current token as the imaginary part instead of the next token.

DONE.
