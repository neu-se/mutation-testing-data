 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the tap function would always return a promise that resolves to undefined, regardless of the original promise's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the tap function would always return a promise, even if the original promise is not a Q promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the tap function would modify the original promise's value by adding 1, instead of passing it through unchanged.

DONE.
