  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a function that writes data to a file, whereas `fs.createWriteStream` is a function that creates a writable stream to a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createReadStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.createReadStream` is a function that creates a readable stream to a file, whereas `fs.createWriteStream` is a function that creates a writable stream to a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.appendFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.appendFile` is a function that appends data to a file, whereas `fs.createWriteStream` is a function that creates a writable stream to a file.

DONE.
