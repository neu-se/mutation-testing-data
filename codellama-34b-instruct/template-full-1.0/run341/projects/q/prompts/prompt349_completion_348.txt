  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
     if (value !== null && value !== void 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would no longer check if `value` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
     if (value !== 1) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would only skip the rest of the function if `value` is exactly equal to `1`, rather than any falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
     if (!value) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would only skip the rest of the function if `value` is a falsey value, such as `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
