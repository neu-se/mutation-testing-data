  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` would always notify the progress, regardless of the promise's state, whereas the original code `progressed` only notifies the progress if the promise is still pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject()` would always reject the promise, regardless of the promise's state, whereas the original code `progressed` only notifies the progress if the promise is still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve()` would always resolve the promise, regardless of the promise's state, whereas the original code `progressed` only notifies the progress if the promise is still pending.

DONE.
