  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `test && false` is always false, regardless of the value of `test`. This means that the `if` statement that checks `test(data)` will never be executed, and the function will always return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `test || false` is always true, regardless of the value of `test`. This means that the `if` statement that checks `test(data)` will always be executed, and the function will always return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` is the negation of `test`, meaning that it will always be true if `test` is false, and vice versa. This means that the `if` statement that checks `test(data)` will always be executed, and the function will always return `null`.
