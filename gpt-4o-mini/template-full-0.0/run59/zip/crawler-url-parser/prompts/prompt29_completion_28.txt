Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the base URL string instead of the current URL string, potentially leading to incorrect URL resolution when the current URL is relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends "extra" to the current URL string, which would cause the URL parsing to fail or produce an unexpected result, as the URL would no longer be valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because converting the current URL string to uppercase could affect the parsing of the URL, especially in cases where the protocol or domain is case-sensitive, leading to incorrect URL resolution.

DONE.
