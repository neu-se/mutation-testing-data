Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would not escape the '$' character, potentially leading to incorrect path resolution if the targetPath contains '$' characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would use the currentPath instead of the targetPath, effectively copying files to the same directory instead of the intended target directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(targetPath, path.basename(source))
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would append the basename of the source path to the targetPath, potentially changing the intended target file or directory name.

DONE.
