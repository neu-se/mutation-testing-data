  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'mice', which is the correct plural form for the word 'mouse'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'mice', which is the correct plural form for the word 'mouse'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mous'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'mice', which is the correct plural form for the word 'mouse'.

DONE.
