  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` rounds the number towards zero, while `parseFloat` returns the full decimal representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number` is a constructor function that returns a number primitive, while `parseFloat` returns a number primitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds the number down towards negative infinity, while `parseFloat` returns the full decimal representation.

DONE.
