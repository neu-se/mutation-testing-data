  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code converts it to lowercase before using it. This could cause the `matches` method to return a different result, potentially allowing or denying access to a resource that should not be accessible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code removes the first character of the path before using it. This could cause the `matches` method to return a different result, potentially allowing or denying access to a resource that should not be accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the mutated code extracts the last segment of the path before using
