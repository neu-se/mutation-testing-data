  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which adds the values, whereas the new code fragment uses the `*` operator, which multiplies the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which adds the values, whereas the new code fragment uses the `-` operator, which subtracts the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, which adds the values, whereas the new code fragment uses the `/` operator, which divides the values.

DONE.
