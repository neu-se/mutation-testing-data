  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in the code never calling `emit('load', 0)`, even if `_data.size` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.length` is only representative of the number of elements in the array, not the size of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in the code never calling `emit('load', null)`, even if `_data.size` is 0.

DONE.
