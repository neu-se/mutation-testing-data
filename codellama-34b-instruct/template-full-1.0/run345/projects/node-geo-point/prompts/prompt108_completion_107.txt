  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would return `undefined` instead of an object with `x` and `y` properties, causing an error when trying to access those properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would return `null` instead of an object with `x` and `y` properties, causing an error when trying to access those properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` function would return `0` instead of an object with `x` and `y` properties, causing an error when trying to access those properties.

DONE.
