  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, so `typeof lastOp` would return `"object"` if `lastOp` is an object, and the comparison would evaluate to `true` if `lastOp` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a particular class, and `Object` is the base class of all objects in JavaScript. If `lastOp` is an object, the comparison would evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object is a reference to the function that created the object, and `Object` is the function that creates objects in JavaScript. If `lastOp` is an object,
