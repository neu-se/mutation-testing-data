  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string 'foo' to the src variable, which would change the path that is being zipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the src variable to uppercase, which would change the path that is being zipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only zip the first part of the src variable, which would be a different path than the original code.

DONE.
