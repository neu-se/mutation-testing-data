  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not calling the `nextStream` function, but instead was referring to it. By adding the parentheses, the function would be called, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not passing any arguments to the `nextStream` function, but this code fragment is passing `null` as an argument. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not passing any arguments to the `nextStream` function, but this code fragment is passing `undefined` as an argument. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
