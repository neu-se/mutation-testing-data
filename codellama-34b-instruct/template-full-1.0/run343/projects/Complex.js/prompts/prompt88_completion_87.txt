  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a different array element, which may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take the absolute value of the array element, which may change the resulting behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i] * tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the array element by itself, which could change the overall behavior of the code.

DONE.
