  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 1);
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `1`, instead of the actual number of keys in the database. This will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over all keys in the database, even if the database is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', -1);
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of `-1`, which is an invalid number of keys in the database. This will cause the `forEach` method to throw an error when it tries to access the `size` property of the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value that is one more than the actual number of keys in the database. This will cause the `forEach`
