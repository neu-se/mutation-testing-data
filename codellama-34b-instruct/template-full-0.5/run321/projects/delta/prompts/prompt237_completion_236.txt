  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the number of operations to perform, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the loop to perform twice as many operations, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the number of operations to perform, and subtracting 1 would cause the loop to perform one fewer operation, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the number of operations to perform, and adding 1 would cause the loop to perform one more operation, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
