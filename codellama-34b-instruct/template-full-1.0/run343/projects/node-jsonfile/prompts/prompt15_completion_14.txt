  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `fromCallback` is a different method than `fromPromise`, and it would change the way the function is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the function being called, and it would no longer be using the `universalify` module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the way the JSON data is stringified, and it would no longer be using the `stringify` function from the `utils` module.

DONE.
