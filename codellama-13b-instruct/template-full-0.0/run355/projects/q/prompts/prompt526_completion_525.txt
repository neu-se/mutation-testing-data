  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not an array, and therefore the `spread` function would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not an array, and therefore the `spread` function would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object is not an array, and therefore the `spread` function would not work as intended.

DONE.
