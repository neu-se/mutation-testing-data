  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, even if the index started at 0 or a negative value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute for every other element in the array, skipping over the odd-indexed elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute for every even-indexed element in the array, but would skip over every odd-indexed element, resulting in an incorrect result.

DONE.
