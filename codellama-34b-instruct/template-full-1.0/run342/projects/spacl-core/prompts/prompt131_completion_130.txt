  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the condition, causing the code to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition from an equality check to a non-equality check, which could cause the code to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition from an equality check to a non-equality check, which could cause the code to behave differently for certain inputs.

DONE.
