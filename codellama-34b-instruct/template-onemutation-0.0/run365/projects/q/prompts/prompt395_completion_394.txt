  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function that returns a promise, while `this.then.bind(this)` is a bound function that returns a promise when called. In the original code, the function is called immediately, but in the modified code, it is not called until the promise is resolved.

DONE.
