 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with `undefined`, which could cause issues if the `cb` variable was defined as `null` or any other falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator, which checks the type of the variable, rather than checking for strict equality with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.cb === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for `cb` in the global scope, rather than checking the local scope. This could cause issues if there is a global variable with the same name as the local variable.

DONE.
