  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the variable `a` instead of `b` in the `reduce` callback, which could lead to different results if `a` has a different value than `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the property to `null` instead of using the value of `b`, which could lead to different results if the property value is expected to be `null` or not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the negation of the value of `b` instead of `b` itself, which could lead to different results if `b` has a falsey value like `0` or `''`.

DONE.
