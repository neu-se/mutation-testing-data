  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, which checks if either iterator has a next value. In contrast, the modified code fragment uses the logical AND operator, which checks if both iterators have a next value. This change would cause the loop to terminate earlier, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() || !otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical OR operator, which checks if either iterator has a next value. In contrast, the modified code fragment uses the logical NOT operator, which checks if both iterators do not have a next value. This change would cause the loop to terminate later, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() ? otherIter.hasNext() : true
```
