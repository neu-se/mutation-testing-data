Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `hasNext()` to always return `false` when the index is greater than 0, leading to incorrect behavior when checking for the presence of subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `hasNext()` to return `true` only if the number of operations is greater than the current index, which could lead to incorrect results if the index is already at the end of the operations array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `hasNext()` to always return `true`, as the peekLength would always be greater than `-1`, potentially leading to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior when iterating through the operations.

DONE.
