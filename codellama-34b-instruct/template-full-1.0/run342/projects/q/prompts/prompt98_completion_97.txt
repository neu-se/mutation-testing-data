  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++index
```
This would result in different behavior because the ++ operator would increment the value of index by 1 before it's used, making the loop skip an iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--index
```
This would result in different behavior because the -- operator would decrement the value of index by 1 before it's used, causing the loop to enter an infinite loop if the initial value of index is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index --
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of index by 1 after it's used, causing the loop to skip an iteration.

DONE.
