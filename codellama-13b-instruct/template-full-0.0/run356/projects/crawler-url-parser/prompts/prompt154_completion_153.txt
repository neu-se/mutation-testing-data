  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences of the pattern in the string, rather than just the last one. This could cause the `linkurl_without_last_part` and `pageurl_without_last_part` variables to be different, which could affect the return value of the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to ignore case when matching the pattern. This could cause the `linkurl_without_last_part` and `pageurl_without_last_part` variables to be different, which could affect the return value of the `gettype` function.
