  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< then(deferred.reject) >
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< timeout(0, deferred.resolve) >
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
< notify(deferred.resolve) >
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to notify immediately, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

DONE.
