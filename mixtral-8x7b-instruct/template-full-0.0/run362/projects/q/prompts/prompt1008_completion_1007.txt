 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, but skips the first argument, which is the `name` variable in this context. The original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which is an alias for `[].slice.call(arguments, 1)`, but directly replacing it with the latter form would change the behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to get the second key from the `arguments` object as if it were an actual object. However, the `arguments` object is not a regular object, and its keys are not the same as the array indices. The original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which is a function specifically designed to handle the `arguments` object in a way that allows extracting its elements as if it were an array.
