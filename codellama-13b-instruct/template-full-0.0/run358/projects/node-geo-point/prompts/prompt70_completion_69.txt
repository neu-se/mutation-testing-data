  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert radians to degrees, while the modified code fragment uses the `Math.PI` constant to perform the same conversion. This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is a more precise representation of pi, which could lead to different results in calculations involving angles.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert radians to degrees, while the modified code fragment uses the `Math.E` constant to perform the same conversion. This would result in different behavior because the `Math.E` constant is a more precise representation of the base of the natural logarithm, which could lead to different results in calculations involving angles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because
