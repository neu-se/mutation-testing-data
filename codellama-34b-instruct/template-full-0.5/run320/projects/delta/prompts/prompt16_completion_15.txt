  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b === undefined` checks if `b` is undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would still consider it an object and execute the code inside the if statement, while the mutated code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `b !== null` checks if `b` is not null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it an object and execute the code inside the if statement, while the mutated code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `!b` checks if
