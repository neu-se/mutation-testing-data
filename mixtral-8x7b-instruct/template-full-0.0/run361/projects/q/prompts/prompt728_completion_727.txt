 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would resolve the promise with the original array of promises, rather than the resolved values. This means that consumers of the `all` function would not receive the resolved values, but rather the original promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject()
