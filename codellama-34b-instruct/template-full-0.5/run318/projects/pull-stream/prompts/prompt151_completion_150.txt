  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, while `0` is a number. The function call would likely have side effects and modify the state of the program, while the number `0` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, while `1` is a number. The function call would likely have side effects and modify the state of the program, while the number `1` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abortCb` is a function call, while `null` is a null value. The function call would likely have side effects and modify the state of the program, while the null value would not.

DONE.
