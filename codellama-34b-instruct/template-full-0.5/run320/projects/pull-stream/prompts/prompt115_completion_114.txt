  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` returns the accumulated value, while replacing it with `null` would return `null` instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` returns the accumulated value, while replacing it with `undefined` would return `undefined` instead, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` returns the accumulated value, while replacing it with `acc + 1` would return the accumulated value plus 1, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
