  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, but the loop would never execute because the length of the object is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Object.keys(sources).length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, but the loop would start at the last key instead of the first key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.floor(Math.random() * Object.keys(sources).length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object, but the loop would start at a random key instead of the first key.

DONE.
