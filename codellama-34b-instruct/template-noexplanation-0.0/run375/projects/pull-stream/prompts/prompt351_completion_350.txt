  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The original code fragment returns the result of calling the `test` function with the `data` argument, while this code fragment returns the result of calling the `test.test` function with the `data` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data) + 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The original code fragment returns the result of calling the `test` function with the `data` argument, while this code fragment returns the result of calling the `test.test` function with the `data` argument, and then adds 1 to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test(data) * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. The original code fragment returns
