 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a negative number is being taken as a negative number, which is not consistent with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of 0 is being taken as 0, while the original code fragment takes the square root of the absolute value of a, which could be a positive number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * a
