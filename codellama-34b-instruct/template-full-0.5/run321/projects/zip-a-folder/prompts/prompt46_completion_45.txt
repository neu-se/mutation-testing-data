  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would include the entire directory tree, rather than just the files in the directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would include the entire directory tree, rather than just the files in the directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would include the entire directory tree, rather than just the files in the directory.

DONE.
