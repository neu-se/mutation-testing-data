Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = !end ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the original `data` when `end` is false, instead of applying the `mapper` function to `data`, potentially leading to incorrect results when `end` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = !end ? data + 1 : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies `data` by adding 1 to it when `end` is false, which changes the output in a way that does not reflect the intended mapping behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data = !end ? null : mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `null` when `end` is false, effectively ignoring the `data` and not applying the `mapper` function, which could lead to loss of information.

DONE.
