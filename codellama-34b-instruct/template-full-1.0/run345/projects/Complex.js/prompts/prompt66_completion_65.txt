  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a;` is not a valid object property accessor. The original code fragment `a['phi']` is valid, but it accesses the `phi` property of the `a` object. With `a;`, the semicolon is treated as a statement terminator, and an error will be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['PI'];
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['PI']` accesses the `PI` property of the `a` object, which is not defined in the code snippet provided. The original code fragment `a['phi']` accesses the `phi` property of the `a` object, which is defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['sin']();
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['sin']()` calls the `sin()` method of the `a` object, which is not defined in the code
