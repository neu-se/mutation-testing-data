  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a[key]` is undefined, while the new code fragment checks if it is not undefined. This means that the new code fragment will return `b[key]` even if `a[key]` is not undefined, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a[key]` exists and is not undefined, while the new code fragment checks if `a` has a property with the same name as `key` and if that property is not undefined. This means that the new code fragment will return `b[key]` if `a` has a property with the same name as `key` even if that property is undefined, which may not be the desired behavior.
