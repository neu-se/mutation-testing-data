  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the same body and scope as the original function, but with a different `this` value. In this case, the new function would have `this` set to the `promise` object, which would cause the `inspect` method to be called on the promise object instead of the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the `inspect` method on the `reject` function with the `this` value set to the `promise` object. This would cause the `inspect` method to be called on the promise object instead of the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply
