  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `arguments` object to `array_slice`, whereas the original code only passes the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `arguments` object starting from the second argument, whereas the original code only passes the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `arguments` object starting from the third argument, whereas the original code only passes the first argument.

DONE.
