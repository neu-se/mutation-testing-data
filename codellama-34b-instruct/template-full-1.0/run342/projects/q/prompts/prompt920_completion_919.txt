  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp` would be undefined, and `callback.apply` would throw a `TypeError` if it is not passed a valid object as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the first argument to `callback.apply`, which might cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, ...arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.call` would be used instead of `callback.apply`, which would cause the callback to be invoked with the specified `thisp` value and an array of the arguments instead of a single array of all the arguments.

DONE.
