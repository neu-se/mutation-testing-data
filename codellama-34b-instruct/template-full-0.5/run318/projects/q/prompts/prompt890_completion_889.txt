  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nfapply` method is not defined on the `Q` function, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fapply` method is not defined on the `Q` function, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nbind(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nbind` method is not defined on the `Q` function, and it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
