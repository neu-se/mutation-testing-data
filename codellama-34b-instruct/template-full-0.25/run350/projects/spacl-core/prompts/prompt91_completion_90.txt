  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code fragment simply iterates over the `policies` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(p => p.name !== 'admin')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array with only the elements that pass the filter function, whereas the original code fragment simply iterates over the `policies` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(p => p.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the result of calling the provided function on each element, whereas the original code fragment simply iterates over the `policies` array.

DONE.
