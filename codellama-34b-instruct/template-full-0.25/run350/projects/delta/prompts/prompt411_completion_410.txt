  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more ops to iterate over, whereas `thisIter.hasNext` is a property that returns the next op in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next op in the iteration, whereas `thisIter.next` is a property that returns the next op in the iteration without advancing the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next op in the iteration without advancing the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` is a property that returns the next op in the iteration.

DONE.
