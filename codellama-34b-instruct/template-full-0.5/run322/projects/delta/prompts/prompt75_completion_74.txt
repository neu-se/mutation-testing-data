  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneShallow
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneShallow` only performs a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` performs a deep copy, which would result in different behavior for objects with nested properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clone
```
This would result in different behavior because `clone` is a generic function that performs a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` performs a deep copy, which would result in different behavior for objects with nested properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object))` performs a deep copy of the object using JSON serialization and deserialization, whereas `cloneDeep` uses a custom implementation that may not handle all edge cases.

DONE.
