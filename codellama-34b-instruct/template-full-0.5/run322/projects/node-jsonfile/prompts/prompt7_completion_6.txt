  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the function to block the event loop while reading the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync('non-existent-file.txt')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error when trying to read a non-existent file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, { encoding: 'utf16' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to read the file with a different encoding, which could result in a different output.

DONE.
