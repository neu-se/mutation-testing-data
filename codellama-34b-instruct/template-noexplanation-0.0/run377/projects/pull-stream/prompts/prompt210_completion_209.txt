  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This code fragment will call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` argument, which is the error that was passed to the `next` function. This will cause the `abortCb` function to be called twice, which may cause unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null)
```
This code fragment will call the `abortCb` function with a `null` argument, which is not the same as the `aborted` argument that was passed to the `next` function. This may cause the `abortCb` function to behave differently than it would if it were called with the `aborted` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This code fragment will call the `abortCb` function with the `err` argument, which is the error that was passed to the
