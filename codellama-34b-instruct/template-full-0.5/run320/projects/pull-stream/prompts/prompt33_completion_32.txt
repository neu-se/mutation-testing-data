  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `read` variable, which is a function, but the new code fragment is using the `null` value, which is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `read` variable, which is a function, but the new code fragment is using the `undefined` value, which is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `read` variable, which is a function, but the new code fragment is using the `0` value, which is not a function and will not be called.

DONE.
