  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is used with a different argument, and it would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(otherIter.next()) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is used without args, and it would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(otherIter.next(1)) === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is used with arg 1, and it would not be equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
