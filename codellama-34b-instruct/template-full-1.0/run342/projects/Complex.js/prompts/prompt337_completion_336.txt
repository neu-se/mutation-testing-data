  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.sqrt(1 + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a constant, while `b` is a variable. In the original code, `b` is part of the complex number `this`, which means that the `b` in the PLACEHOLDER is referring to a different variable than the `a` in the division.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are swapped in the PLACEHOLDER. In the original code, `a` is divided by `b`, while `b` is divided by `a` in the PLACEHOLDER.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is squared in the PLACEHOLDER, while it is only squared in the original code.

DONE
