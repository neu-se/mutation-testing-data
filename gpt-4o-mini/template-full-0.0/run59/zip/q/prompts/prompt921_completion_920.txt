Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).done
```
This would result in different behavior because using `.done` instead of `.fail` would cause unhandled rejections to be ignored, potentially leading to silent failures in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `.catch` instead of `.fail` would change the way errors are handled, as `.catch` only catches errors thrown in the promise chain, which may lead to different error propagation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `.then` instead of `.fail` would cause the rejection to be treated as a successful resolution, which would incorrectly resolve the promise instead of rejecting it.

DONE.
