  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.nextType` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.nextType` would return the type of the next operation in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` would return the length of the current operation, whereas `otherIter.peekType` returns the type of the current operation.

DONE.
