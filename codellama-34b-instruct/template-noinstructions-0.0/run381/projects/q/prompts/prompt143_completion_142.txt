  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ < p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is flipped, so the condition would be true if the error's stack counter is less than the promise's stack counter, rather than greater than.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ === p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed to check for equality, so the condition would be true if the error's stack counter is equal to the promise's stack counter, rather than greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ >= p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed to check for greater
