  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `0` instead of `1`, which is a different behavior than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `-1` instead of `1`, which is a different behavior than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the length of the array minus `1` instead of `1`, which is a different behavior than expected.

DONE.
