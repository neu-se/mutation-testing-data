  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be off by one, potentially causing the `slice` method to return an incorrect subset of the `Delta` object's `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be off by one in the opposite direction, potentially causing the `slice` method to return an incorrect subset of the `Delta` object's `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end - index` calculation would be off by two, potentially causing the `slice` method to return an incorrect subset of the `Delta` object's `ops` array.

DONE.
