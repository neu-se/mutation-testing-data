  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an error handler to the `pipe` method, which can help to catch any errors that may occur during the compression process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('finish', resolve);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds a finish handler to the `pipe` method, which can help to ensure that the compression process is completed successfully.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('close', resolve);
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds a close handler to the `pipe` method, which can help to ensure that the compression process is completed successfully and that the output stream is closed properly.

DONE.
