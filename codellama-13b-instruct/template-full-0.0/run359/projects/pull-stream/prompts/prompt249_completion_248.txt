  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `abort` function to be called even if it returns a falsy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `abort` function to be called only if it returns a truthy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would cause the `abort` function to be called only if it returns a truthy value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
