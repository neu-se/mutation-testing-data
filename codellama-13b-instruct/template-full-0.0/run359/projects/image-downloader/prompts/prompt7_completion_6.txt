  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would not be executed, and the `options.dest` would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename = true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would be executed, and the `options.dest` would be modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would not be executed, and the `options.dest` would not be modified.

DONE.
