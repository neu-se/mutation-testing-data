  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("I'm a bug!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "I'm a bug!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string, which would be assigned to the `Q` variable, causing the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined`, which would cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
