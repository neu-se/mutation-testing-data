  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'boolean' == typeof err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the variable, and the string `'boolean'` would not be equal to the string `'function'` returned by the `typeof` operator when `err` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is a function, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality including the type of the variables. The `err` function is not equal to `true`, which is a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the variable, and the string `'function'` would not be equal to the string `'undefined'` returned by the `typeof` operator when `err` is undefined.

DONE.
