  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?.` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the code to evaluate to `undefined` if `zipAFolderOptions` is `undefined`, rather than throwing a `TypeError`.

DONE.
