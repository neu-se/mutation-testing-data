  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `1` would cause the `parser_exit` function to return an exit code of `1`, indicating an error, whereas the original code would return an exit code of `0` indicating success.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(NaN);
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `NaN` (Not a Number) would cause the `parser_exit` function to return an exit code of `NaN`, which would be interpreted as an error by the calling code, whereas the original code would return an exit code of `0` indicating success.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(Infinity);
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `Infinity` would cause the `parser_exit` function to return an exit code of `Infinity`, which would be interpreted as an error by the calling code,
