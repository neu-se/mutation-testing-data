  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise without rejecting it, which would cause the function to return a resolved promise instead of a rejected one, even if the input is invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('The options.dest is required');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with a message that is different from the original code, which would cause the function to throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return request(options);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `request` function with the same options as the original code, which would cause the function to return a promise that is different from the one returned by the original code.

DONE.
