  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method in the `Q` object that returns a promise for an array of values, whereas `any` returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a different method in the `Q` object that returns a promise for an array of promises, whereas `any` returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a different method in the `Q` object that returns a promise for an array of promises, whereas `any` returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array.

DONE.
