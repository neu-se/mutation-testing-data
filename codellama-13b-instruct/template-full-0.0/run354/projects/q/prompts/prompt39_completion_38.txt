  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to throw an error, which would prevent the rest of the code from executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to return early, which would prevent the rest of the code from executing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to log a message to the console, which would not affect the rest of the code's behavior.

DONE.
