  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different. The original pattern matches the string "/default." followed by any number of lowercase letters, while the new pattern matches the string "/default." followed by any number of uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is empty, so the match is removed instead of replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is "default", which is different from the original replacement string "/".

DONE.
