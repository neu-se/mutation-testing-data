  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `err` object in the callback, while the new code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `err` object in the callback, while the new code fragment returns the string "error".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `err` object in the callback, while the new code fragment returns a new `Error` object with the message "error".

DONE.
