  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value in JavaScript, and the original code fragment is checking for the `end` argument to be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value in JavaScript, and the original code fragment is checking for the `end` argument to be truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Number.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number", and the original code fragment is checking for the `end` argument to be a number.

DONE.
