  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would not pass the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are being passed as a nested array instead of a flat array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are being concatenated with themselves, resulting in a different set of arguments being passed to the function.

DONE.
