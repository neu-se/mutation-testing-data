  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return an array of keys from the `data.countries` object, rather than an array of country objects. This will likely cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return an array of values from the `data.countries` object, rather than an array of country objects. This will likely cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to return an array of key-value pairs from the `data.countries` object, rather than an array of country objects. This will likely cause the `getAllCountries` function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
