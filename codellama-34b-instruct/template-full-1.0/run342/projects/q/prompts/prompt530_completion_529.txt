  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects an object, but would receive the number 5 instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects an object, but would receive the value undefined instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expects an object, but would receive the value null instead.

DONE.
