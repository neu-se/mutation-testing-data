  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the timezone instead of the timezone object, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezones property of the timezone object, which is an array of timezone objects, instead of the timezone object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name).timezones[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first timezone object in the timezones array, instead of the timezone object itself.

DONE.
