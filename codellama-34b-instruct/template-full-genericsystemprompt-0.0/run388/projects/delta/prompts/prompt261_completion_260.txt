  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.invert
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.invert` is a different function than `AttributeMap.diff`, and it would cause the code to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.compose
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.compose` is a different function than `AttributeMap.diff`, and it would cause the code to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.transform
```
This would result in different behavior because `AttributeMap.transform` is a different function than `AttributeMap.diff`, and it would cause the code to produce a different output.

DONE.
