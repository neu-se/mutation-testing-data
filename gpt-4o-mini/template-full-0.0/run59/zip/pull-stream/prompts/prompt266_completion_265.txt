Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass `null` as the data to the callback, regardless of the actual data read from the stream, potentially leading to incorrect processing of the stream's contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the positions of the arguments, passing the data as the first argument and `null` as the second, which could lead to confusion in the callback handling since the first argument is typically expected to be an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + ' modified'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string ' modified' to the data, altering the actual data being processed and potentially causing downstream logic to fail or behave unexpectedly if it relies on the original data format.

DONE.
