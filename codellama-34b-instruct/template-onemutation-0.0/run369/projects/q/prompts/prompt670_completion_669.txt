  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is called on `args` instead of `args` itself, which would return a new array with the first element removed. This would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different outcome.

DONE.
