  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the argument to the `Math.sqrt()` function is flipped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.sqrt()` function is changed to include the imaginary part of the complex number, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument to the `Math.sqrt()` function is changed to include both the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
