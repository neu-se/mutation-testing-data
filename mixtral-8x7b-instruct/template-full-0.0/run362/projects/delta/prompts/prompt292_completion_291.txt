 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition now includes the case where index is equal to 0, which might cause the code to handle newline characters at the beginning of the string differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > -1
