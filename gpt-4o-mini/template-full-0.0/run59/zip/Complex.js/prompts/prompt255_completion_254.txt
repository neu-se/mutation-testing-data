Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the real part of the complex number before applying the exponential function, which changes the output significantly compared to using just `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the imaginary part `b` instead of the real part `a`, which would lead to a completely different result in the calculation of the complex exponential.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the logarithm of the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of just the real part `a`, which alters the expected output of the function.

DONE.
