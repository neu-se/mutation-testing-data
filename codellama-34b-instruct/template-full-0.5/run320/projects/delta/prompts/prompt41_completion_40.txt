  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(b)` returns an array of keys from the `b` object, while `attributes` is an object that contains the keys and values from both `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(b)` returns an array of values from the `b` object, while `attributes` is an object that contains the keys and values from both `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(b)` returns an array of key-value pairs from the `b` object, while `attributes` is an object that contains the keys and values from both `a` and `b`.

DONE.
