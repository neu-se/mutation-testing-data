  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.pop()` would remove the last element of the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment `const cb of cbs` would iterate over each element of the `cbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.shift()` would remove the first element of the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment `const cb of cbs` would iterate over each element of the `cbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of the `cbs` array except the first one, whereas the original code fragment `const cb of cbs` would iterate over each element of the `cbs` array.
