  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task, head.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong values to the `runSingle` function, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task, tail.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong values to the `runSingle` function, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` values to the `runSingle` function, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
