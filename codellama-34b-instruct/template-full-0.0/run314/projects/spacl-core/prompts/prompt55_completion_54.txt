  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.*/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.*` at the end of the regex would match any character, including the `/` character, which would cause the regex to match more than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.+/`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.+` at the end of the regex would match one or more of any character, including the `/` character, which would cause the regex to match more than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}.*/i`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match case-insensitively, which would
