```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 2, regardless of the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 3, regardless of the input value.

DONE.
