  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):([^ ]+)$/.exec
```
This would result in a different regex match because it looks for a non-whitespace character at the end, instead of a specific pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in a different regex match because it looks for any character, instead of a specific pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/at ([^ ]+):(\d+):(\w+)$/.exec
```
This would result in a different regex match because it looks for a word character at the end, instead of a specific pattern.

DONE.
