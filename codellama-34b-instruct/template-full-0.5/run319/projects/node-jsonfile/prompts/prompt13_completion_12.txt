  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the code assumes that it is always present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : options.encoding

This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the code assumes that it is always present. Additionally, the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the code assumes that it is always present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : options.encoding ? options.encoding : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not always present in the `options` object, and the code assumes that it is always present. Additionally, the `encoding`
