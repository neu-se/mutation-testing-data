  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `id` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `timezones` object using the `id` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `countries` object using the `id` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
