  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key used to check for the property would be different, potentially causing the code to access a different property or to fail to find the property altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key used to check for the property would be different, potentially causing the code to access a different property or to fail to find the property altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, "key"
```
This would result in different behavior because the key used to check for the property would be a string, which would cause the code to access a different property or to fail to find the property altogether.

DONE.
