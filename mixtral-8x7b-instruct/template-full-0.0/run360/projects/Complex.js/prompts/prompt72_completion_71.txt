 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match()` method call on the `a` string would not return `null` but instead throw a `TypeError` when `a` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
