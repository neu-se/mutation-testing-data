  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in the function always returning `true`, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in the function always returning `0`, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in the function always returning an empty array, regardless of the input arguments.

DONE.
