  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only `rejects` the promise, but this new code would also `reject` the promise with a specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only `rejects` the promise, but this new code would also `resolve` the promise with a specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only `rejects` the promise, but this new code would also throw an error.

DONE.
