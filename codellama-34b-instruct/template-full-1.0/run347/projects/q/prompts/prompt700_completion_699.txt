  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is always `undefined`, while `args.concat` concatenates the elements of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a constant value, while `args.concat` concatenates the elements of the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is the result of an invalid operation (e.g., division by zero), while `args.concat` concatenates the elements of the `args` array.

DONE.
