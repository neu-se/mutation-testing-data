  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` checks if the `pageurl_path` is a substring of `linkurl_path`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if `pageurl_path` is a member of the array returned by `split()`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(1) === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` is removing the first character of `linkurl_path` before comparing it to `pageurl_path`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
