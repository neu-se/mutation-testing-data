  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `runSingle` is called twice, which may cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `runSingle` is called with a null domain, which may cause errors if the function expects a domain object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(noop, domain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `runSingle` is called with a no-op function, which may cause the program to behave differently if the function has side effects.

DONE.
