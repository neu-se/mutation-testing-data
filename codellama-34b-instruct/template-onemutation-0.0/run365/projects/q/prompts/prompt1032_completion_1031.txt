  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error as the first argument and the value as the second argument, while the new code fragment passes the error as the second argument and the value as the first argument. This would cause the error to be treated as the value and the value to be treated as the error, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
