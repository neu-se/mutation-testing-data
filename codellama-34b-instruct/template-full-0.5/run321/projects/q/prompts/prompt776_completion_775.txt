  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function(err) { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown synchronously, rather than being propagated through the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; }, function(err) { return err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be returned as a resolved value, rather than being propagated through the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value; }, function(err) { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown synchronously, rather than being propagated through the promise chain.

DONE.
