  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](-1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a different value for the argument to `isZero`, which could cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](-1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a different method, `isZero`, and a different value for the argument, which could cause a different value to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'](-1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used a different method, `isZero`, and a different value for the argument, which could cause a different value to be returned.

DONE.
