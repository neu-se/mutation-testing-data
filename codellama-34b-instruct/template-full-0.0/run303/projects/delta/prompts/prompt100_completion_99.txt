  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the condition, so the code would execute the `if` block if `lastOp.attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas the original code would execute the `if` block if `lastOp.attributes` is not `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is being checked instead of the `attributes` property itself. If `lastOp.attributes` is an empty array, the original code would execute the `if` block, but the modified code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes.length
