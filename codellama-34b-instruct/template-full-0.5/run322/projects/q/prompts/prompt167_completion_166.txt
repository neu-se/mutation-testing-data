  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first line of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= lines.length; ++i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = lines.length - 1; i >= 0; --i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate in reverse order.

DONE.
