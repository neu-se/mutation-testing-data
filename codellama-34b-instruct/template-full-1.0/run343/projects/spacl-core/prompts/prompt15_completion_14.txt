  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).input
```
This would result in different behavior because the `input` method returns the original string that the match was performed on, whereas the `spec.match` method returns the first match found in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).group(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `group` method with an argument of 0 returns the first match found in the string, whereas the `spec.match` method returns the entire match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property returns the number of characters in the matched string, whereas the
