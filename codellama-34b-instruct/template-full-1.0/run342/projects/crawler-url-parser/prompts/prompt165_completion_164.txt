  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path + "/*"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any path that starts with the `pageurl_path`, whereas the original code fragment only matches the exact path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last part of the `pageurl_path`, whereas the original code fragment extracts the entire path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last part of the `linkurl_path`, whereas the original code fragment extracts the entire path.

DONE.
