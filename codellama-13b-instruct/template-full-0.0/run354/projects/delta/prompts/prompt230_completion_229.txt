  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the entire length of the `ops` array, rather than just the length of the current line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the length of the current line, rather than the entire length of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(iter.peekLength(), this.ops.length - baseIndex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the minimum of the length of the current line and the remaining length of the `ops` array, rather than the entire length of the `ops` array.

DONE.
