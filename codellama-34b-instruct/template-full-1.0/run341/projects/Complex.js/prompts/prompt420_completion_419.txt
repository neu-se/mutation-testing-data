  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks if the real part is Infinity, while `isZero()` checks if the real part is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this['isZero']()` checks if the real part is not zero, while `this['isInfinite']()` checks if the real part is Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] === Infinity` checks if the real part is equal to Infinity, while `this['isInfinite']()` checks if the real part is Infinity.

DONE.
