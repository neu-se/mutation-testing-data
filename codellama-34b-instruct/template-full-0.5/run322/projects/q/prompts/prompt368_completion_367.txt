  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` and `_rejected` are two different functions, and the code expects to call `_rejected` when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` and `_fulfilled` are two different functions, and the code expects to call `_rejected` when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a different function than `_rejected`, and the code expects to call `_rejected` when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
