  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be replaced with its first element, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object, op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` parameter would be replaced with a new array that contains all elements of `args` except the first one, which could cause the `dispatch` function to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
