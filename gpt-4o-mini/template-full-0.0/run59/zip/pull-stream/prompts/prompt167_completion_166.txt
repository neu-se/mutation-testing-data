Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback with `true`, regardless of the value of `abort`, which would prevent the abort logic from functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be invoked with `false` when `abort` is true, which is contrary to the intended behavior of aborting the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the `abort` value by adding 1, potentially leading to unexpected results in the abort handling logic, as it no longer directly passes the original `abort` value.

DONE.
