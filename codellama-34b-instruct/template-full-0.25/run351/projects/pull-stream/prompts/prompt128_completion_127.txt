  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to `true`, while the new code fragment `false` would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to `true`, while the new code fragment `null` would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always evaluate to `true`, while the new code fragment `undefined` would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

DONE.
