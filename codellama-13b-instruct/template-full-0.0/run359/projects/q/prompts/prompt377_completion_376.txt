  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `newValue` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior depending on the implementation of the `toString()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf()` method is called on the `newValue` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior depending on the implementation of the `valueOf()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toJSON()` method is called on the `newValue` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior depending on the implementation of the `toJSON()` method.

DONE.
