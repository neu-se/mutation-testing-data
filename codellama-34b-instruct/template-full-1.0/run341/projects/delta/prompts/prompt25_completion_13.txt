  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a[key] + b[key]```
This would result in different behavior because `+` operator would concatenate the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` instead of comparing them, which would lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b[key] - a[key]```
This would result in different behavior because `-` operator would subtract `a[key]` from `b[key]` instead of comparing them, which would lead to incorrect results in the `diff` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```!isEqual(a[key], b[key])```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` function returns `true` if the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` are equal, so negating the condition would cause the `diff` function to return `true` even if the values are not equal.

DONE.
