Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from "post" to "get", which may not be supported by the object, leading to a different execution path or an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the method name from "post" to "send", which could invoke a different function with potentially different parameters and return values, affecting the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"dispatch"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from "post" to "dispatch", which may not have the same implementation or expected behavior, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the arguments or promise resolution.

DONE.
