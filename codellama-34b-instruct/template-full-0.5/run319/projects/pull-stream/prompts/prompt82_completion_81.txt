  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is not the same as `done` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || false, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort || false` is not the same as `abort` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is not the same as `cb` in the original code.

DONE.
