  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line separator from a newline character to a tab character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line separator from a newline character to a carriage return character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the line separator from a newline character to a space character.

DONE.
