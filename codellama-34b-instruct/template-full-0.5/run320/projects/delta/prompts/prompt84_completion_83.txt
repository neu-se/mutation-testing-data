  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is not being used to compare the attributes, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the attributes are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is being called with the `strict` parameter set to `true`, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the attributes are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is being called with the `strict` parameter set to `false`, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the attributes are not equal.

DONE.
