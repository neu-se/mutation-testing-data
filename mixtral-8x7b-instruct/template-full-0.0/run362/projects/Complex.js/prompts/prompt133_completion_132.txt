 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the reciprocal of the imaginary part is infinity, instead of checking if the entire complex number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] > Number.MAX_VALUE || z['im'] > Number.MAX_VALUE
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real or imaginary part is greater than the maximum representable number, instead of checking if the entire complex number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isInfinite(z['re']) || isInfinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either the real or imaginary part is infinite, instead of checking if the entire complex number is infinite.

DONE.
