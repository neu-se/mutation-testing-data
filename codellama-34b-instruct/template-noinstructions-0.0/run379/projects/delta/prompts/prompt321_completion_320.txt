  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `op.retain` is a non-empty object, regardless of whether `op.delete` is `true` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `op.retain` is a non-empty object, regardless of whether `op.delete` is `true` or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `op.retain` is a non-empty object, regardless of whether `op.delete` is `true` or not.

DONE.
