  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b == null` checks if `b` is null or undefined, while `typeof b !== 'object'` only checks if `b` is not an object. If `b` is null or undefined, the original code would return `undefined`, while the modified code would return `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === undefined` checks if `b` is undefined, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object. If `b` is undefined, the original code would return `undefined`, while the modified code would return `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b` checks if `b` is falsy, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object. If `b` is f
