  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the newline character (`\n`) to split the data into rows, while the new code fragment uses the carriage return and newline characters (`\r\n`) to split the data into rows. This would cause the data to be parsed differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
