  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is no longer 200, but 300, which is a redirect status code. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, even if the request was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is now less than 200, which is an invalid status code. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, even if the request was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code is now 404, which is a not found status code. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`, even if the request was successful.

DONE.
