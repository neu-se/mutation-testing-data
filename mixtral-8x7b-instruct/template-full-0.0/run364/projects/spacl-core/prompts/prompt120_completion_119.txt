 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false when `ctx` is not provided, even if the path matches the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<any random object>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a TypeError when `ctx` is not provided, as the `in` operator would be checking the presence of properties in an object that is not an actual query context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return false when `ctx` is not provided, as the `in` operator would check for properties in an empty object, which would never match the properties from the regex.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing aims to reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite, encouraging developers to improve their tests and ensure better code coverage.
