  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.values()` method, which returns an iterator over the values in the map, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `Array.from()` method, which creates a new array from the values in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.values()` method, which returns an iterator over the values in the map, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `Array.from()` method, which creates a new array from the keys in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(urlMap.entries())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.values()` method, which returns an iterator over the values in the map, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `Array.
