Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in an error because the method `parse()` expects a `URL` object, but is being passed a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in a different URL being parsed, potentially leading to different results in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedUrl.href, true, true)
```
This would result in a different URL being parsed, potentially leading to different results in the rest of the code.
