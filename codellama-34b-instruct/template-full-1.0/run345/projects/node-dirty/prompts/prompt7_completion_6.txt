  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid key in a `Map` object, and it would be treated as a new key if it doesn't already exist, rather than updating the existing key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire key-value pair from the `Map` object, rather than updating the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key] = 42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value associated with the key to `42`, rather than updating it based on the provided value.

DONE.
