  In this case, we want to find potential issues with the test suite by inserting different code fragments that behave differently than the original code fragment. 

1. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "data * 2".
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation is not present in the original code fragment. As "data" is an object, multiplying it by two does not make sense and will likely cause an error.

2. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "data[0]".
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not contain the array access operator "[0]". As "data" is an object, adding this operator will cause an error, making the conditional statement return a different value.

3. The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with "data.age".
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not access the "age" property of the "data" object. Adding this property will give a different result, making the conditional statement return a different value.

DONE.
