  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `set()` adds or updates an element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` removes a specific element from the map, whereas `set()` adds or updates an element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` stores the provided value in the map, whereas `key * 2` would multiply the value of `key` by 2.

DONE.
