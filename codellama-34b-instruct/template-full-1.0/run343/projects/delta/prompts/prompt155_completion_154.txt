  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherIterHasNext = !thisIter.peekType() === !'insert';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `otherIter.hasNext()` method, causing the `while` loop to terminate early or continue indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherIterHasNext = thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for the loop to continue, potentially causing the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherIterHasNext = thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && otherIter.hasNext();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition for the loop to continue, potentially causing the method to return a different value.

DONE.
