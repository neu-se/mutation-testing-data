  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would not be parsed as a URL, and the `true` and `true` values would not be used as the `slashesDenoteHost` and `queryString` options, respectively.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slashesDenoteHost` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be parsed as a hostname, rather than a URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `queryString` option would be set to `true`, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to be parsed as a URL, but the `slashesDenoteHost` option would be set to `false`, which would cause the `baseUrlStr` to
