  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read ? read.source() : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `read` is a function and calls it with zero arguments if it is. However, this replacement code checks if `read` is a function and calls it with one argument (the `source` property) if it is. This could cause the code to behave differently if `read` is a function but does not have a `source` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `read` is a function and calls it with zero arguments if it is. However, this replacement code checks if `read` is a function and returns `null` if it is not. This could cause the code to behave differently if `read` is not a function, and could also cause the `pull` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read ? read.source :
