  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  return op.retain + iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current op, plus the length of the next op in the iterator, instead of just the length of the current op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  return op.retain - iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the current op, minus the length of the next op in the iterator, instead of just the length of the current op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  return iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next op in the iterator, instead of the length of the current op.

DONE.
