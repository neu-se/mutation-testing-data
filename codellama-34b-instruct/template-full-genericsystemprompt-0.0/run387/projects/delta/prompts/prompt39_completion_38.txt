  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the property is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is null.

DONE.
