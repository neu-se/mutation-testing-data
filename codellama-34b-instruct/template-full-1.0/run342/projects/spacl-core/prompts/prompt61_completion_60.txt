  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^/]+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are removed, and the regex will now match any character except for /, instead of only matching a single `/` character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(?:/[^/]+)*
```
This would result in different behavior because the non-capturing group is no longer optional, and the regex will now match any number of sequences of characters that do not include a `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^/]+){1,1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the quantifier `{1,1}` is unnecessary, and the regex will now match any number of sequences of characters that do not include a `/` character, but only one of them can be captured.

DONE.
