 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ filename: 'incorrect_dest' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `createWriteStream` function would receive a hardcoded string 'incorrect\_dest' instead of the original `dest` variable, causing the written data to be saved to a file with an incorrect name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ foo: dest }
