  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is reversed, so the code would enter the "if" block when `b` is positive, instead of when it's negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is reversed, so the code would enter the "if" block when `b` is negative or zero, instead of when it's positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from "less than" to "not equal to", so the code would enter the "if" block when `b` is not zero, instead of when it's negative.

DONE.
