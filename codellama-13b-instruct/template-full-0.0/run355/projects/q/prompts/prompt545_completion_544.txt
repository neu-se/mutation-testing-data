  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not handle the case where the generator is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] || Q.return(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would handle the case where the generator is not defined by returning a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.return(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, regardless of whether the generator is defined or not.

DONE.
