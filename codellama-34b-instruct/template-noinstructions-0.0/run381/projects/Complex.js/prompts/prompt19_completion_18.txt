  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `y` directly, while the replaced code fragment uses the square of `y`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `y` directly, while the replaced code fragment uses the sum of `y` and itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `y` directly, while the replaced code fragment uses the difference of `y` and itself.

DONE.
