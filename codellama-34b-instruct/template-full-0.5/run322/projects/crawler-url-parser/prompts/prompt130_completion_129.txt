  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.protocol` is a string representing the protocol of the URL, whereas `pageurl` is a URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.hostname` is a string representing the hostname of the URL, whereas `pageurl` is a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.pathname` is a string representing the pathname of the URL, whereas `pageurl` is a URL object.

DONE.
