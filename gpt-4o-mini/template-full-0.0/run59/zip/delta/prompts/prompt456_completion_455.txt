Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the slice of operations starting from the next index, potentially skipping the current operation and altering the expected output of the `rest` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to slice the operations starting from the previous index, which could lead to an incorrect or empty array if the index is already at the start, thus changing the expected result of the `rest` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a slice of the operations starting from the beginning of the array, regardless of the current index, which would not reflect the intended behavior of returning the remaining operations from the current position.

DONE.
