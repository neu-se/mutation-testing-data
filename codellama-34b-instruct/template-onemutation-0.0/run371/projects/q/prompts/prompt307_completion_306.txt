  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called on the `Q` function, which would return a new promise that is resolved with the value of `answerPs[i]`. However, the original code fragment calls the `then` method on the `answerPs[i]` promise, which would return a new promise that is resolved with the value of `answerPs[i]` only if the `answerPs[i]` promise is fulfilled. If the `answerPs[i]` promise is rejected, the new promise would be rejected with the same reason.

DONE.
