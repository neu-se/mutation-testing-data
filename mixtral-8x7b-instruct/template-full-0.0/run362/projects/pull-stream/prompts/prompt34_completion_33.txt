 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0, 1)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the first element of `ref`, instead of directly accessing the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[ref.length - 1]
