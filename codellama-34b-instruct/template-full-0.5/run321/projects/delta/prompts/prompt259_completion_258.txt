  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property is not defined for the `otherOp` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for the `insert` property of the `otherOp` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not defined for the `otherOp` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
