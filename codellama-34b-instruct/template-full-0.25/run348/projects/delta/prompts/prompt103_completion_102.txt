  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `filter` returns the elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` executes a provided function once for each element of the array, whereas `filter` returns the elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` executes a provided function for each element of the array, using the return value of the function as the accumulator for the next iteration, whereas `filter` returns the elements of an array that meet the condition specified in a callback function.

DONE.
