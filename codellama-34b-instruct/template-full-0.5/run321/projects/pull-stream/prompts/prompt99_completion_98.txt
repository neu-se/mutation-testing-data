  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` when `err` is `false`, even if `err` is also `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true ? err : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `err` when `err` is `true`, even if `err` is also `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` when `err` is `null`, even if `err` is also `true`.

DONE.
