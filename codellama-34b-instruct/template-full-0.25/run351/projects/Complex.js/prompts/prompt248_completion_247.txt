  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a)` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number minus one, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number minus one and returns a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(b)` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number minus one, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number minus one and returns a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a + b)` is a function that calculates the exponential of a number minus one, whereas `Math.expm1` is a
