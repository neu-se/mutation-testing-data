  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the name, which would cause the method to be called with a different name than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the toUpperCase() method on the name, which would cause the method to be called with a different name than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the name as the first argument to the method, rather than the name itself.

DONE.
