  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(0, ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the last operation in the slice, while the original code fragment excludes the last operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(1, ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first operation in the slice, while the original code fragment includes the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.slice(1, ops.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude both the first and last operations in the slice, while the original code fragment includes both operations.

DONE.
