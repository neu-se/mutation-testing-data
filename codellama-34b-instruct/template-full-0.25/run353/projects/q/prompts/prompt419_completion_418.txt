  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.state` is undefined, so the comparison would always return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect()` is a function that returns an object with a `state` property, so the comparison would always return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.state` is a function, and `this.inspect.state()` would return the result of calling that function, which is not the same as comparing the `state` property of the object returned by `this.inspect()`.

DONE.
