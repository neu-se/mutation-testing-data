  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return at least 1, even if the input is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, even if the input is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, even if the input is non-zero.

DONE.
