  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allResolved", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `allResolved` is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allResolved, "allSettled", "allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the functions passed to `deprecate` has been changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled, "allResolved", "allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `allSettled` is not defined in the code snippet provided.

DONE.
