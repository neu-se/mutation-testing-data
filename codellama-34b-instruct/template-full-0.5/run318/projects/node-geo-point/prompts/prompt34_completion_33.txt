  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the formula for calculating the distance between two points on a sphere would be incorrect if `sin` is used instead of `cos`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` is a trigonometric function, and the formula for calculating the distance between two points on a sphere would be incorrect if `tan` is used instead of `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / cos` is the reciprocal of `cos`, and the formula for calculating the distance between two points on a sphere would be incorrect if `1 / cos` is used instead of `cos`.

DONE.
