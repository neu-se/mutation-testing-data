  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with `1 + cos`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with `sin`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with `Math.PI`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
