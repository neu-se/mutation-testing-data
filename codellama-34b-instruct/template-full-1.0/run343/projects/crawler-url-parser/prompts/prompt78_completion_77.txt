  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(document).find('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all <a> elements in the document instead of just those inside the <body> element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a:not(.external)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all <a> elements that do not have the class "external", which would exclude URLs that are not on the same domain as the current page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a:not([href*="javascript:"])')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all <a> elements that do not have a JavaScript protocol in the href attribute, which would exclude JavaScript links.

DONE.
