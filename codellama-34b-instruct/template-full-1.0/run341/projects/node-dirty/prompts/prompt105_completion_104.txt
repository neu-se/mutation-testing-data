  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.val` would return the value associated with the key, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'test_key'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'test_key'` is a hardcoded string, rather than a variable that holds the key being searched for.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'my_key' + row.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.key` would be concatenated with the string `'my_key'`, which would produce a different key than the original.

DONE.
