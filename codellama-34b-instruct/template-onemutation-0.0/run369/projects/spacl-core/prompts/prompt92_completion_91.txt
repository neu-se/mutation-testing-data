  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy of policies.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values()` method returns an iterator over the values in the `policies` map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys in the map. This change would cause the `push()` method to set the same policy multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `query()` and `matches()` methods.

DONE.
