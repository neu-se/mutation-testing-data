Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index from which the arguments are sliced, potentially omitting the first argument instead of the first two, leading to incorrect method invocation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from "post" to "get", which alters the intended action of invoking a method to retrieving a property instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the variable `args` instead of slicing the `arguments` object, which may lead to incorrect or unexpected arguments being passed to the method.

DONE.
