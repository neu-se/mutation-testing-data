  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that closes the write stream, whereas `destroy()` is a method that destroys the stream and emits an `error` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork()` is a method that pauses the write stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that close the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.uncork()
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork()` is a method that resumes the write stream, whereas `end()` and `destroy()` are methods that close the stream.

DONE.
