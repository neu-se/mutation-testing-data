  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return the countryId without the first character, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.indexOf("_")
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method would return the index of the first occurence of the underscore character, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length property would return the number of characters in the countryId string, potentially causing errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
