  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? 0 : r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 when r > 1, instead of returning 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? r : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 when r <= 1, instead of returning r.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r > 1 ? r : -r
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -r when r <= 1, instead of returning r.

DONE.
