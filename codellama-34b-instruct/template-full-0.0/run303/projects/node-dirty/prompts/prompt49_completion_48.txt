  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the update to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `updater` function would be called with the wrong arguments, causing the update to fail.

DONE.
