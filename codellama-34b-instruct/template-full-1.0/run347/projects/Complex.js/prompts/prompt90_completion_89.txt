  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now applying a different value (3 instead of 2), which would change the outcome of the conditional expression and the result of the concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operand is now referring to the previous token instead of the next token, which could change the outcome of the concatenation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional expression is now using a different condition (adding instead of subtracting), which would change the outcome of the concatenation.

DONE.
