  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute value of `a`, regardless of whether `b` is positive or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute value of `b`, regardless of whether `a` is positive or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the absolute value of `a + b`, regardless of whether `a` and `b` are positive or negative.

DONE.
