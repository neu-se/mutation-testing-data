  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would make the match case-insensitive, which could cause the code to return a different result for URLs with uppercase letters in the fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would make the match global, which could cause the code to remove multiple fragments from the URL instead of just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/gi, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gi` flags at the end of the regular expression would make the match case-insensitive and global, which could cause the code to remove multiple fragments from the URL and also match case-insensitively.

DONE.
