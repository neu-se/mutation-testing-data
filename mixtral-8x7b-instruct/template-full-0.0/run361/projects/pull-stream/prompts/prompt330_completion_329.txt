 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would receive `null` instead of the data, potentially causing it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` would receive the current context (`this`) instead of the data, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` would receive two arguments instead of one, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
