  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method, but it may not be a full-fledged promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `isObject` is a function that checks if a value is an object, but it does not check if the object is a promise or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isString
```
This would result in different behavior because `isString` is a function that checks if a value is a string, but it does not check if the string is a promise or not.

DONE.
