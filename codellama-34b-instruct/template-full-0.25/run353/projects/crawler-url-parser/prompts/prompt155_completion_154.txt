  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last path segment from the URL, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the last path segment from the URL, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a fragment identifier to the URL, potentially changing the meaning of the URL.

DONE.
