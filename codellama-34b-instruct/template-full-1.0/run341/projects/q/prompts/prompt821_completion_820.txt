  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is a JavaScript operator that evaluates to `undefined`, and it would cause the `done` method to return `undefined` instead of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(Q).done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` method to be called on the `Q` function itself, instead of the promise returned by the `done` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` method to be called on a deferred object that is not a promise, which would result in an error.

DONE.
