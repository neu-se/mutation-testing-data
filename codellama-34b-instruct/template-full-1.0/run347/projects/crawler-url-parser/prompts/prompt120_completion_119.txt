  Sure, here are three possible code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the `gettype` function:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl, pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `linkurl` and `pageurl` variables to be swapped, which would change the result of the comparison in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.subdomain, pageurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `subdomain` property of the `linkurl` and `pageurl` objects to be swapped, which would change the result of the comparison in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host, pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `host` property of the `linkurl` and `pageurl` objects to be swapped, which would change the
