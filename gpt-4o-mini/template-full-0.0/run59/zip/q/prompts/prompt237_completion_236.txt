Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return the promise object when `messages` is falsy (i.e., `undefined`), which is the opposite of the original logic that checks if `messages` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `messages` array is empty instead of checking if it exists, which would lead to returning the promise only when there are no messages, rather than when messages are present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `resolvedPromise` is `null`, which is not the same as checking if `messages` exists, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when resolving the promise.

DONE.
