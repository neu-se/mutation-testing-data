```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow()` function would return a different value.

DONE.
