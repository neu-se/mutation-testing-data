  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task, domain, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the third argument to the `runSingle` function, which would cause the function to throw an error when it tries to access the `domain` property of the `undefined` value.

DONE.
