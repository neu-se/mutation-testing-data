  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called on the object would change from "post" to "get".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument would be passed to the method being called on the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments being passed to the method would be reversed.

DONE.
