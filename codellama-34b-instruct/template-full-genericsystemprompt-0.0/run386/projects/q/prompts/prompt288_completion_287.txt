  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a promise for the value, rather than the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a promise for the value, rather than the value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with a promise for the value, rather than the value itself.

DONE.
