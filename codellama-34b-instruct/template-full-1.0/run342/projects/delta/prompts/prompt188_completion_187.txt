  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first 100 elements of the array, regardless of the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last element of the array, regardless of the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(array.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the middle element of the array, instead of the last element.

DONE.
