  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisData` object is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherData` object is not defined in the code snippet, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the `handler.transform` method to return `null`, which would then be assigned to the `transformedData` variable. This would cause the `transformedData` variable to have a different value than the original code, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
