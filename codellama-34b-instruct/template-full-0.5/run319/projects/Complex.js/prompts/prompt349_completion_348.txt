  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the output to be inverted, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function has a different range of values than the cosine function, resulting in a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the added 1 would shift the output range, resulting in a different complex number.

DONE.
