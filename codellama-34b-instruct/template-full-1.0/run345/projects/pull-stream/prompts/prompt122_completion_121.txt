  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error if `source` is not a function, while the modified code fragment would throw an error in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err) {
  if (err) {
    cb(err);
  } else {
    sink(data);
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not handle errors correctly, while the modified code fragment would handle errors by calling `cb` with the error as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  sink(data);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error if `source` is
