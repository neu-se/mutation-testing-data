  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the given value, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("Error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all([Promise.reject("Error message")])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable have resolved, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

DONE.
