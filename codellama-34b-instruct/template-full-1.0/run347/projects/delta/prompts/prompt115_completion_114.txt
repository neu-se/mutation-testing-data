  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
initialValue = Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas `initialValue` is a variable that is likely expected to be an object with a non-null prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
initialValue = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number and not an object, whereas `initialValue` is likely expected to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
initialValue = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, whereas `initialValue` is likely expected to be an object.

DONE.
