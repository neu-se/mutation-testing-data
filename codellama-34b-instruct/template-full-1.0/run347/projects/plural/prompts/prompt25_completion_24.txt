  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` and `substr` are different functions that behave differently when negative values are passed as parameters. `substr` will return the substring starting from the specified position and going to the end of the string, while `substring` will return the substring between the specified start and end positions, inclusive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` is a different function that returns the last index at which a specified string can be found in the input string, while `substr` returns a substring starting from a specified position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a different function that returns the first index at which a specified string can be found in the input string, while `substr` returns a substring starting from a specified position.

DONE.
