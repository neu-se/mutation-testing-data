  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this code fragment appends an 's' to the word. This would cause the plural form of words like "cod" to be "cods" instead of "cod".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep)\b/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this code fragment appends an 'es' to the word. This would cause the plural form of words like "cod" to be "codes" instead of "cod".
