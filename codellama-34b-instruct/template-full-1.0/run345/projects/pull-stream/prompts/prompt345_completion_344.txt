  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `===` operator, which checks for strict equality, while the mutated code uses the `!==` operator, which checks for strict inequality. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where the type of the `abort` variable is not a boolean.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === "true" ? null: abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `===` operator with a boolean value, while the mutated code uses the `===` operator with a string value. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases where the type of the `abort` variable is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `===` operator with a boolean value,
