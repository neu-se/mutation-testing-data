  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace the last letter of the word with 'ies', while the new code fragment would replace the last two letters of the word with 'ies'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would replace the last letter of the word with 'ies', while the new code fragment would replace the last three letters of the word with 'ies'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(
