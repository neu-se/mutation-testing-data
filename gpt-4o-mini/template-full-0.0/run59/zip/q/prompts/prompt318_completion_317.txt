Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the prototype of the promise to the constructor function itself, which may lead to unexpected results when trying to access properties or methods that are expected to be on the Promise prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with no prototype, meaning that the promise will not inherit any methods or properties from the Promise prototype, potentially breaking promise functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the promise to the Promise constructor itself, which could lead to recursive calls or incorrect behavior when methods are invoked on the promise, as it would not behave as an instance of a promise.

DONE.
