  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function, which is expected to be passed as an argument to the `set` method. Replacing it with `null` would cause the `set` method to fail silently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function, which is expected to be passed as an argument to the `set` method. Replacing it with an empty function would cause the `set` method to do nothing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('Test error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function, which is expected to be passed as an argument to the `set` method. Replacing it
