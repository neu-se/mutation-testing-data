  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. The `arguments.length` property returns the number of arguments passed to the function, while the `arguments` object itself contains the actual values of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(x) { return x - 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using the `arguments` object, which is an array-like object containing the values of the arguments passed to the function. The `arguments` object itself contains the actual values of the arguments, while the `function(x) { return x - 1; }` lambda function takes a single argument `x` and returns its value minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var x = 1;
arguments[x - 1]
```
