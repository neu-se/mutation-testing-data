  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a number, and `op` is an object, so `op.delete` would be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number, and `op` is an object, so `op.retain` would be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, and `op` is an object, so `op.insert` would be `undefined`.

DONE.
