Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
","
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the query string by commas instead of equal signs, leading to incorrect query parameter counting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
";"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of semicolons in the query string instead of equal signs, which would not accurately reflect the number of query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"?"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of question marks in the URL, which is not a valid way to determine the number of query parameters and would likely return an incorrect count.

DONE.
