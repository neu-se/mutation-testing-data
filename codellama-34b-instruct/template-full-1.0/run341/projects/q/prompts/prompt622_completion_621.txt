  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have duplicate values, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would have duplicate key values, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting array would only have a single element, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

DONE.
