  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and the negation of that check would return `true` for any value that is not NaN, including finite numbers and infinite values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks if a value is a finite number, and it would return `false` for any value that is NaN or infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and it would return `true` for any value that is NaN, including finite numbers and infinite values.

DONE.
