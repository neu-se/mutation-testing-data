  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and it will be called when the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and it will be called when the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a different function than `onFulfilled`, and it will be called when the promise is in progress instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
