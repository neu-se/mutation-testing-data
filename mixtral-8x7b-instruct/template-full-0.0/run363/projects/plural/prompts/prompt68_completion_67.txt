 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'mem'
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned string would be "mems" instead of "memos".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'memo0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the `addRule` function would not match the string, and the word would not be pluralized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would append the letter "a" to the word instead of "s", resulting in incorrect pluralization.

DONE.
