  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state = "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the state of the promise to "rejected" regardless of its actual state, which could lead to unexpected consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state = "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the state of the promise to "fulfilled" regardless of its actual state, which could lead to unexpected conclusions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state = "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the state of the promise to "pending" regardless of its actual state, which could lead to unexpected conclusions.

DONE.
