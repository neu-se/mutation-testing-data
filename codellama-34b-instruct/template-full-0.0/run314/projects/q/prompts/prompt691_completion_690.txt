  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the `Promise.prototype` object, rather than `void 0`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
