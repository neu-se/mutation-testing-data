 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of operations taken from the other Delta when both this and other Deltas have a retain operation with an object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of operations taken from the other Delta when both this and other Deltas have a retain operation with an object value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a division by zero error, which is not handled in the original code.

DONE.
