  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` will empty the entire queue, whereas `delete` will only remove the specific key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.add(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `add()` will add the key to the queue, whereas `delete` will remove it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it will set the size of the queue to 0, whereas `delete` will only remove a specific key.

DONE.
