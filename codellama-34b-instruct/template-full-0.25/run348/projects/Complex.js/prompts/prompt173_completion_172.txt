  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.
