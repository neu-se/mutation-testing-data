  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` expects a single argument, but `key` and `val` are being passed as separate arguments. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `try...catch` block and emitted as an error event.

DONE.
