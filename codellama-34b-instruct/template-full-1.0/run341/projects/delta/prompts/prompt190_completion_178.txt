  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the operation `newOp` from the delta, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the operation `newOp` in the delta, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete(delta)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the delta from the operation `newOp`, which is not the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
