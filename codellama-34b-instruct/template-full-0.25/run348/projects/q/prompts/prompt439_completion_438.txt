  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("something went wrong"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the given error, rather than resolved with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "something else"; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`, rather than the original value.

DONE.
