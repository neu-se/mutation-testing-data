  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(' ', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `path.join()` method to concatenate the `options.dest` path with the decoded basename of the URL, while the buggy code fragment uses the `replace()` method to remove any spaces from the `options.dest` path. This could potentially cause the downloaded image to be saved in a different location than expected.
