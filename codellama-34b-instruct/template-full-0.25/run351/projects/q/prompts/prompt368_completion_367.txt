  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns the progressed value, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
