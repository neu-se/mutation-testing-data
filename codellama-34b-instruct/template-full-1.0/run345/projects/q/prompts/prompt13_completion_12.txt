  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call `ses.notOk()` is not defined in the code snippet provided, and would therefore throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call `laterQueue.length()` is not defined in the code snippet provided, and would therefore throw a ReferenceError. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the if condition to be false, even if laterQueue is not empty.

DONE.
