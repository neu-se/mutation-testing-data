Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the module exports to be skipped entirely if the `module` object is not defined, which is the opposite of the original intent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the module from being exported if `module` is not an object, which could lead to issues in environments where the module system is expected to be present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to `module.exports`, effectively breaking the export of the `Delta` class and making it unavailable for import in other modules.

DONE.
