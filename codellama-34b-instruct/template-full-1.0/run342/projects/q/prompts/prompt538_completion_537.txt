  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a method that returns a new promise, while `this.all` is a method that returns an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.race
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.race` is a method that returns a new promise that resolves or rejects with the value of the first promise in the array that settles, while `this.all` is a method that returns an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.any` is a method that returns a new promise that resolves or rejects with the value of the first promise in the array that settles, while `this.all` is a method that returns an array of promises.
