  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => seg + acc, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of concatenation would be reversed, which could affect the final result of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => acc + seg, <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator would be a forward slash instead of a backslash, which could affect the parsing of the regex.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => acc + seg.slice(1), <PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first character of each part would be removed before concatenation, which could affect the final result of the function.

DONE.
