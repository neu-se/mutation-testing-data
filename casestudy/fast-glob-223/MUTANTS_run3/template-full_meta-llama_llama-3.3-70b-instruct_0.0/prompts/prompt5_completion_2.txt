Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ strict: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strict` option is set to `true` instead of `false`, which could affect how the `isGlob` function handles certain patterns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty options object is passed to the `isGlob` function, which might have different default behavior than when the `strict` option is explicitly set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed to the `isGlob` function instead of an options object, which could cause the function to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
