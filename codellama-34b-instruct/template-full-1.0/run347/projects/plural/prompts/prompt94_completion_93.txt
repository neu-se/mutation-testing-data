  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches words that end with "man," while the new code fragment matches words that end with "man" or "woman."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(wo)?man$/i, function(w, regex) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes only one argument to the callback function, while the new
