  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
