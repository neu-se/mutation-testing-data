  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are two different functions that have different purposes in the context of promises. While `resolve` is used to fulfill a promise with a value, `reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the reason instead of being rejected, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects a reason as an argument, and passing `null` as the reason would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason than the original code. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript
