 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the correct way to calculate the cosine of a number in JavaScript, while `cos` is a reference error since it is not defined in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a positive value, while the original code can return negative values. This is because the reciprocal of the cosine of an angle can be negative, depending on the quadrant of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` calculates the sine of a number, while `Math.cos` calculates the cosine of a number. This would result in a completely different calculation and therefore different behavior.

DONE.
