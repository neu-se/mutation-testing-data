  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to attempt to parse the next token as a float, which could result in an error if the next token is not a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the length of the next token as the argument to `parseFloat`, which could result in an error if the next token is not a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to multiply the next token by 2 before parsing it as a float, which could result in an error if the next token is not a valid number.

DONE.
