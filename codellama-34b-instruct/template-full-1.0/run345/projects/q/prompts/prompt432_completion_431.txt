  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(value).state === "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method with an argument, which would cause the method to return a different value than without the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "rejected";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `inspect` method, causing the condition to be evaluated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state is not "fulfilled", which would cause the condition to be evaluated differently.

DONE.
