  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf.call(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` would bind the `this` context of `array_indexOf` to `unhandledRejections`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_indexOf` with the wrong arguments, leading to an incorrect index being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(promise, unhandledRejections)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_indexOf` with the arguments in the wrong order, leading to an incorrect index being returned.

DONE.
