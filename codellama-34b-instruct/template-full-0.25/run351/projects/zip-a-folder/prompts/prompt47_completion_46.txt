  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would now include the contents of the `src` directory, whereas the original code fragment did not include the contents of the directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { exclude: ['**/*.txt'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would now exclude all files with a `.txt` extension, whereas the original code fragment did not exclude any files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, false, { include: ['**/*.txt'] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `directory` method would now include only files with a `.txt` extension, whereas the original code fragment included all files.

DONE.
