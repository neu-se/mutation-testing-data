Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` changes the context in which the function is called, potentially leading to different behavior if the function relies on the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` explicitly instead of `void 0` may lead to different handling in some JavaScript environments, especially if the function being called has specific checks for `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty array instead of `args` means that the function will be called with no arguments, which could lead to different outcomes depending on how the target function is designed to handle its parameters.

DONE.
