  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `universalify` function to return a different value, which would then be passed to the `stripBom` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `universalify` function to throw an error, which would then be caught and handled by the `try-catch` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}^)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `universalify` function to return a different value, which would then be passed to the `JSON.parse` function, causing it to throw an error.

DONE.
