  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rule[0]) === 'Strong';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of checking the type of the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return rules[0] === 'Strong';
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first rule instead of checking the type of the current rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return rules.length === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of checking the length of the `rules` array.

DONE.
