  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `Error` object is not always a string, and calling `toString()` on it ensures that it is converted to a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the first line of the stack trace, which may not contain the entire error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `message` property of the `Error` object, which may contain more information about the error than the stack trace.

DONE.
