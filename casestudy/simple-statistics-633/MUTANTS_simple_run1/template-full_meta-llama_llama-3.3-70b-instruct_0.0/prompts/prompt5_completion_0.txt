Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof x[i] === "number"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the element is a number instead of not a number, causing the function to return NaN when it encounters a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i % 2 !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when the index is odd, regardless of the type of the element, introducing an unrelated condition to the original logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
x[i] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns NaN when a negative number is encountered, which is not the original intention of checking for non-numeric values.

DONE.
