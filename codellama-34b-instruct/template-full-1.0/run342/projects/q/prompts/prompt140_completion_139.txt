  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary `!` operator will invert the truthiness of the value of `p`, whereas the binary `!=` operator would return `true` if `p` is not equal to `p` (which is always false).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return the last value evaluated if the first value is truthy, which would be `1` in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator would return `true` if `p` is an object, whereas the unary `!` operator would invert the truthiness of `p`.

DONE.
