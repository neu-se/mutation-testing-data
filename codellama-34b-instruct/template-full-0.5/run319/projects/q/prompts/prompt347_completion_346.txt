  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `rejected` is a function, while this code checks if it is not null. If `rejected` is not a function, but not null, the code would behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `rejected` is a function, while this code checks if it is undefined. If `rejected` is not a function, but not undefined, the code would behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `rejected` is a function, while this code checks if it is not equal to the string "function". If `rejected` is not a function, but not equal to the string "function", the code would behave differently
