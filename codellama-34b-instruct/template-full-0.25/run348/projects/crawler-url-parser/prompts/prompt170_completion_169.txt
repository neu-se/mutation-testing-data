  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.length != pageurl.domain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if their lengths are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.includes(pageurl.domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the domains are equal, while this new code fragment checks if the domain of the link URL includes the domain of the page URL.

DONE.
