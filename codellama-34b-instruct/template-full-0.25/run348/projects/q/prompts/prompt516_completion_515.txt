  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a null value instead of the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the original reason instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject, deferred.notify)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the original reason instead of being rejected, and it would also notify the deferred object of the promise's progress.

DONE.
