  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the function is in an external frame, rather than an internal frame.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the function is not in an internal frame, rather than being in an internal frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(isNodeFrame(stackLine))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the function is not in a node frame, rather than being in a node frame.

DONE.
