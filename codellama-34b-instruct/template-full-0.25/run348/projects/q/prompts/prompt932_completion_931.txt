  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 1` is a function that returns `undefined` and `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`.

DONE.
