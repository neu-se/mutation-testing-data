  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "s" at the end of "chilli" is singular, and "chillis" is the plural form. If the function is given the word "chilli" as input, it will return "chillies" as the plural form, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the "s" at the end of "chillis" is plural, and "chillis" is already the plural form of "chilli". If the function is given the word "chillis" as input, it will return "chillis" as the plural form, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cillies'
```
This would result in different behavior because "cillies" is a made-up word and does not exist in the English language.
