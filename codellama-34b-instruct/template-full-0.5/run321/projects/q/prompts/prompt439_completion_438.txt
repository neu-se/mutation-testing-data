  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections.length` is a number, and `promise` is an object, so the `array_indexOf` function would return -1, indicating that the `promise` is not in the `unhandledRejections` array, even if it is.

```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons
