  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the arguments to the method in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(array_slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(array_slice)` would return a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and itself, which would cause the `nmapply` method to pass the arguments to the method twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== x; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(x) { return x !== x; })` would return a new array that contains only the elements that are not equal to themselves, which would cause the `nma
