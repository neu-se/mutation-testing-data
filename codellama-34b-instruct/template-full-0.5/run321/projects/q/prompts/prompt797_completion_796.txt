  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` values would be passed as arguments to `then`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` values would be passed as arguments to `then`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello", "world", progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the string values would be passed as arguments to `then`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the string "hello" instead of the original value.

DONE.
