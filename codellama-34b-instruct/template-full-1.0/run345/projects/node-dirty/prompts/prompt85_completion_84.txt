  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
buffer.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.slice` would return a substring of the buffer, while `buffer.split` returns an array of substrings split by the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
buffer.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.replace` would replace all occurrences of the separator with the given replacement string, while `buffer.split` returns an array of substrings split by the separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
buffer.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.reverse` would reverse the order of the buffer, while `buffer.split` returns an array of substrings split by the separator.

DONE.
