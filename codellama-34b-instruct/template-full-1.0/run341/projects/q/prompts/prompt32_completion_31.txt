  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runDifferent
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name is changed, and the function `runDifferent` may not exist in the code or may have a different implementation than `runSingle`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, domain)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` and `domain` arguments are reversed, which could cause errors if the function implementation expects them to be in a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(task, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain` argument is hardcoded to `null`, which could cause errors if the function implementation expects it to be a non-null value.

DONE.
