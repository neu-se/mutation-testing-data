This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a message to a Node.js object, while the `send` method is used to send a message to a Node.js object and receive a response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"emit"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is used to send a message to a Node.js object, while the `emit` method is used to send a message to a Node.js object and receive a response, but it also allows for the message to be processed by multiple handlers and allows
