  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while this new code fragment would call `cb` regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `cb`, while this new code fragment passes `null` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `cb`, while this new code fragment passes an error object as an argument.

DONE.
