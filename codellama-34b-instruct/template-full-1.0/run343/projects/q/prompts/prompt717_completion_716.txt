  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getOwnPropertyNames"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the properties of the object, including non-enumerable ones, instead of only the own enumerable properties as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"valueOf"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the primitive value of the object, instead of the object itself which is what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"toString"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the object, instead of the object itself which is what the original code does.

DONE.
