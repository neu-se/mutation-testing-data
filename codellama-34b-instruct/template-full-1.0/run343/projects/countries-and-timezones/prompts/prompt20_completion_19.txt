timezone == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a logical not operator `!` which will always return a boolean value, whereas `timezone == null` will return a boolean only if `timezone` is null or undefined, otherwise it will return the timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone !== null

This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a logical not operator `!` which will always return a boolean value, whereas `timezone !== null` will return a boolean only if `timezone` is not null or undefined, otherwise it will return the timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone && timezone.a
```
