  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function, which is not a valid object to bind to. This would cause an error to be thrown when the `continuer` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with a `null` context, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with a `null` context. This could potentially cause the `continuer` function to behave differently than it would if it were called with a valid context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `
