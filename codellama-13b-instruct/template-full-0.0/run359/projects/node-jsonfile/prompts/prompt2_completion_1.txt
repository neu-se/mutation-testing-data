  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `readFileSync` method is used instead of `readFile`, which would cause the code to block until the file is read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf8'`, which would cause the code to read the file as a UTF-8 string instead of the default encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { flag: 'r' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flag` option is set to `'r'`, which would cause the code to read the file in read-only mode instead of the default mode.

DONE.
