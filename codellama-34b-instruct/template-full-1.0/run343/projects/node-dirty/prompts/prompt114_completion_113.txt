  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
DONE;
```
This would result in different behavior because `DONE` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript that is used to indicate the completion of an asynchronous operation, whereas `load` is an event that is emitted when data is loaded from a file. Using `DONE` instead of `load` would cause the code to execute differently when the file is loaded.

```
This would result in different behavior because `write_close` is an event that is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas `load` is an event that is emitted when data is loaded from a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because `error` is an event that is emitted when an error occurs, whereas `load` is an event that is
