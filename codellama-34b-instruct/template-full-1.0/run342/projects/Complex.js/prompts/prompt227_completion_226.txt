  
Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a*a) + (b*b)
```
This would result in infinite recursion in the `exp` function.

Option 2:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a*a) - (b*b)
```
This would result in a different calculation for the square root of a negative number.

Option 3:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a*a) / (b*b)
```
This would result in different behavior for inputs with very large or very small values of a or b.
