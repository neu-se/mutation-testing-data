  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is likely to be an instance of the Error object, which does not have a `toLowerCase()` method, while `error` is a string that does have this method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(exception || "error").toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `exception` is falsy, such as `null` or `undefined`, it would default to the string `"error"` and then call `toLowerCase()` on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(exception instanceof Error) ? exception.message : "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because if `exception` is not an instance of Error, it would return the string `"error"` instead of the `exception.message`.
