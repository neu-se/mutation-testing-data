  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the angle from degrees to radians, but adding 360 degrees to the angle would cause the result to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(θ) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the angle from degrees to radians, but subtracting 360 degrees from the angle would cause the result to be negative, which is not a valid input for the `deg2rad` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the angle from radians to degrees
