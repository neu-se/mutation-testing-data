  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would not execute any iterations, and the `parts` array would be empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would execute one iteration, and the `parts` array would contain the string `"/[^/]+"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would execute two iterations, and the `parts` array would contain the strings `"/[^/]+"` and `"/[^/]+"`.

DONE.
