  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to be called on the same `GeoPoint` object, which would always return 0 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, point
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to be called on the `point` object, which would always return the same bearing as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, point
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `calculateBearing` method to be called on the `this` object, which would always return a different bearing than the original code fragment.

DONE.
