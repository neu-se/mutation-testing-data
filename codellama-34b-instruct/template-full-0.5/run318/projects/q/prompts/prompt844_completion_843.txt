  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing an error object to the `reject` function, while `null` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing an error object to the `reject` function, while `undefined` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing an error object with a specific message, while the new error object would have a different message.

DONE.
