 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would immediately resolve with an empty array instead of waiting for all input promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Buggy replacement'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would immediately reject with an error instead of waiting for all input promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function would create a new deferred object and not wait for the input promises to settle. Instead, it would return an immediately resolved promise with an empty array.

DONE.
