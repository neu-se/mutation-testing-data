  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of an array, whereas the original `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of an array, whereas the original `push` method adds an element to the end of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the first element of the `progressListeners` array, whereas the original `push` method would add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
