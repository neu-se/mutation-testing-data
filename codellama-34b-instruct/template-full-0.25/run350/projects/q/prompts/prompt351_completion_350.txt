  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, not the `self` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have a `then` method.

DONE.
