  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(point, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the `calculateDistance` method to return an incorrect distance.

DONE.
