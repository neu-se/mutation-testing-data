  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `null` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a more concise way of writing `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null || name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for both `null` and `undefined` values to be passed as the `name` argument.

DONE.
