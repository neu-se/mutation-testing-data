  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("I'm a bug!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `callback` function with the resolved value, while this new code fragment would throw an error instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return "I'm a bug!"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `callback` function with the resolved value, while this new code fragment would return a string instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q.reject("I'm a bug!"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the `callback` function with the resolved value, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise instead.

DONE.
