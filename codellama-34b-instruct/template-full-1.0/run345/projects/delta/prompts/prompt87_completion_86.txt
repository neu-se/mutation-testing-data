  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!newOp.attributes && lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only consider `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` if `newOp.attributes` is falsy, which would lead to a different result when merging the attributes of the two operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes || lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would only consider `newOp.attributes` or `lastOp.attributes`, depending on whether `newOp.attributes` is truthy or falsy, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes ^ lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would perform a bitwise XOR operation on `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes`, resulting in a different value being stored in the `newOp.attributes` property.

DONE.
