  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
instanceof
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` is an operator that checks if an object is an instance of a particular class, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` is a method that returns a string representation of an object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

DONE.
