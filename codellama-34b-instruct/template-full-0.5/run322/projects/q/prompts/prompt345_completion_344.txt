  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `reject` function, which is not the same as throwing an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `reject` function, which is not the same as returning a resolved promise with the exception as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `reject` function, which is not the same as returning a rejected promise with the exception as the reason.

DONE.
