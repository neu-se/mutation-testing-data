  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply", and it would cause the function to be called with the specified `this` value and the specified arguments, but it would not pass the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments as an array of arrays, rather than an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice(0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a copy of the `args` array, rather than the original array.

DONE.
