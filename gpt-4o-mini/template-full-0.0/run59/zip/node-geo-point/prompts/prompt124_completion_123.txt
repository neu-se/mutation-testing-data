Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would change the calculation of the bearing between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude, point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses only the latitude of the current point and the longitude of the target point, ignoring the latitude of the target point, which would lead to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude, point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the longitude of the current point and the latitude of the target point, which would not provide a valid input for calculating the bearing.

DONE.
