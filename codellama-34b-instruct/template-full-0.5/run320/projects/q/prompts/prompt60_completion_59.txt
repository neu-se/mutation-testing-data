  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be called after a certain number of milliseconds, whereas `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be called asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` is a function that schedules a function to be called before the next repaint of the screen, whereas `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be called asynchronously as soon as possible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that schedules a function to be called repeatedly, whereas `setImmediate` is a function that schedules a function to be called asynchronously as soon as possible.

DONE.
