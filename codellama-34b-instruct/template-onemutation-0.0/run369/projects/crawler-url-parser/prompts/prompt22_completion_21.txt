  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while the new code fragment replaces it with "https://". This change would cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
