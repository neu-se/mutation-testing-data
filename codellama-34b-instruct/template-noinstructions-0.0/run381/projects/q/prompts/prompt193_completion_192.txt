  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the `attempt3` array, which is `undefined` in this case, instead of the first element, which is the filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `attempt3` array, which is the filename, instead of the second element, which is `undefined` in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `attempt3` array, which is 2, instead of the first element, which is the filename.

DONE.
