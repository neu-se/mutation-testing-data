  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because `onProgress` is a function that is called when the promise is in progress, whereas `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` are functions that are called when the promise is resolved or rejected.

DONE.
