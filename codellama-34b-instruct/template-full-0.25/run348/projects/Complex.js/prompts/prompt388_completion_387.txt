  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be zero, which would result in a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be a different value than the original code, which would affect the result of the division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to be a different value than the original code, which would affect the result of the division.

DONE.
