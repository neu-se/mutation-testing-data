  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `/` to indicate a directory separator, while `'\\'` would indicate a Windows-style directory separator. This could cause issues if the code is run on a non-Windows system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `/` to indicate a directory separator, while `' '` would indicate a space character. This could cause issues if the code is run on a system where the directory separator is not a space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `/` to indicate a directory separator, while `''` would indicate an empty string. This could cause issues if the code is run on a system where the directory separator is not an empty string.

DONE.
