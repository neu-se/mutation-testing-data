  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject a promise, whereas the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify` to notify the progress of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(anotherPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is used to resolve a promise with a value, whereas the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify` to notify the progress of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.fulfill` method is used to fulfill a promise with a value, whereas the original code fragment uses `deferred.notify` to notify the progress of a promise.

DONE.
