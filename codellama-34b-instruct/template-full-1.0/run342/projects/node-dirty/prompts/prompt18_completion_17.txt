  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the callback function to the list of callbacks, while replacing it with an empty array would cause the callback function to be lost.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.get(key) || []
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the callback function to the list of callbacks, while replacing it with the list of callbacks would cause the callback function to be executed multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the callback function to the list of callbacks, while replacing it with an empty function would cause the callback function to never be executed.

DONE.
