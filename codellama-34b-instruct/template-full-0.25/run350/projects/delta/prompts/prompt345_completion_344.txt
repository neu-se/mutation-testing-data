  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(baseOpData, opData)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to be called with the arguments in the opposite order, which could potentially lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(opData, baseOpData, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to be called with an additional argument, which could potentially lead to different results.

DONE.
