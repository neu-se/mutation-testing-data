 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = rules.length; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates through the `rules` array in reverse order, which changes the behavior of the `unshift` method used in the `addRule` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i in rules) { ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a `for...in` loop instead of a traditional `for` loop, which can result in different behavior when iterating over arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var i = rules.length; i--; ) { ... }
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a decrementing `for` loop, which can result in different behavior when iterating over arrays.

DONE.
