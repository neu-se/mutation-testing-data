  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` parameter is missing, which could cause the `rule.matches()` method to return a different result, even if the `path` parameter has the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(ctx, path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parameters are swapped, which could cause the `rule.matches()` method to interpret the `ctx` parameter as the `path` parameter and vice versa, resulting in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.matches(path, 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` parameter is hardcoded to `'GET'`, which could cause the `rule.matches()` method to return a different result if the `verb` parameter is not `'GET'` in the original code.

DONE.
