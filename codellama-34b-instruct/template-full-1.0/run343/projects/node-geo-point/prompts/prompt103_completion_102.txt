  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360 - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the calculation, causing the destination point to be different each time the method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + Math.PI / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the direction of the bearing by 90 degrees, causing the destination point to be different than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + λ1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the destination point to be the same as the starting point, effectively cancelling the distance and bearing calculations.

DONE.
