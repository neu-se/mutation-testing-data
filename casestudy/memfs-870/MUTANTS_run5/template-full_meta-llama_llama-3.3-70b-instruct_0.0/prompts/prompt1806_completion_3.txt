Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in write mode instead of read mode, potentially overwriting the file's contents.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened in append mode instead of read mode, allowing new data to be added to the end of the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + '_copy', 'r'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to open a different file (the original file name with '_copy' appended) instead of the intended file, potentially leading to a file not found error.

DONE.
