  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(void 0));
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument `void 0` is not the same as the argument `thisp`, which is passed as the `this` context for the bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument `null` is not the same as the argument `thisp`, which is passed as the `this` context for the bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined));
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument `undefined` is not the same as the argument `thisp`, which is passed as the `this` context for the bound function.

DONE.
