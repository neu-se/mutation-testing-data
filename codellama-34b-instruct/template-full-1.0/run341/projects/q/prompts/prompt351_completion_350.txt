  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, self
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `exception` is an object that contains the reason for the rejection, and `self` is the promise instance. By replacing `exception` with `undefined`, the `reject` function will be called without any reason, which will cause the promise to be rejected with an `undefined` reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, self
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `exception` is an object that contains the reason for the rejection, and `self` is the promise instance. By replacing `exception` with `null`, the `reject` function will be called with `null` as the reason, which will cause the promise to be rejected with a `null` reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected", self
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `exception` is an object that contains
