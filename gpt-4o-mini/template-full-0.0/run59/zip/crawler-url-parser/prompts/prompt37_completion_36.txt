Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parsing behavior of the URL, potentially allowing URLs with invalid protocols to be processed instead of rejecting them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the URL parsing to fail silently, leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to access properties of the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to be treated as an HTTP URL, even if it was originally an HTTPS URL, potentially leading to security issues or incorrect URL handling.

DONE.
