  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections` is an array and `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the array, while the original code fragment checks if the array contains a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is another array and `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the array, while the original code fragment checks if the array contains a specific element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is another array and `length` is a property that returns the number of elements in the array, while the original code fragment checks if the array contains a specific element.

DONE.
