  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `_value` variable, regardless of whether it is null or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of the `value` variable, regardless of whether it is null or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `value` variable plus 1, regardless of whether it is null or not.

DONE.
