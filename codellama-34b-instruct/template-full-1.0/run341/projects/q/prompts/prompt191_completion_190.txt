  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(example):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pattern to match the string "example" instead of any characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(example\.com):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pattern to match the string "example.com" instead of any characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*@(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+):(\d+)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the pattern to match an IP address instead of any characters.

DONE.
