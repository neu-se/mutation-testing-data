Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly evaluate to true when ReturnValue is defined, leading to the creation of a new QReturnValue function instead of using the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true if ReturnValue is an object, which is not the intended check, potentially causing the code to incorrectly assume that ReturnValue is defined when it might not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ReturnValue !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if ReturnValue is not null, which does not accurately reflect whether ReturnValue is defined or not, potentially leading to the wrong execution path in the code.

DONE.
