  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\/\//).test(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.match` returns an array of matches, while `(/\/\//).test(spec)` returns a boolean indicating whether the regexp has a match in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match().length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.match().length` returns the number of matches, while `(/\/\//).test(spec)` returns a boolean indicating whether the regexp has a match in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `spec.match()[0]` returns the first match, while `(/\/\//).test(spec)` returns a boolean indicating whether the regexp has a match in the string.

DONE.
