  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to zero, while this replacement checks if it is less than zero.

DONE.
