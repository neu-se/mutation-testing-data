  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an empty array, rather than an array containing all the arguments except the first two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an array containing all the arguments except the last one, rather than an array containing all the arguments except the first two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return an array containing all the arguments except the first two, rather than an array containing all the arguments except the last one.

DONE.
