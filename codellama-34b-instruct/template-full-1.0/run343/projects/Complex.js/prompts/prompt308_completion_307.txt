  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `b` variable to `a`, which could have a significant impact on the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an offset of -1 to the `b` variable, which could cause the calculations to produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the `b` variable, which could cause the calculations to produce different results.

DONE.
