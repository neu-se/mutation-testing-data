  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is not passed to the `parse` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is explicitly set to `null`, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, "http://example.com")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter is set to a different value, which may cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
