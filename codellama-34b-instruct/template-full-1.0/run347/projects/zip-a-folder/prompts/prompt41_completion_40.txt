  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because `/` is a different delimiter than `,`, which could cause errors if the glob pattern is not properly escaped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because `|` is a different delimiter than `,`, which could cause errors if the glob pattern is not properly escaped. Additionally, `|` is not a valid delimiter for glob patterns, so it would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because `;` is a different delimiter than `,`, which could cause errors if the glob pattern is not properly escaped. Additionally, `;` is not a valid delimiter for glob patterns, so it would result in an error.

DONE.
