  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This code fragment uses the `call()` method to invoke the `hasOwnProperty` method on the `point` object, passing in the string `'coordinates'` as an argument. This is a more explicit way of checking if the `point` object has an own property called `'coordinates'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'coordinates')
```
This code fragment uses the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` method to check if the `point` object has an own property called `'coordinates'`. This is a more explicit way of checking if the `point` object has an own property called `'coordinates'`.

```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This code fragment uses the `hasOwnProperty` method to check if the `point` object
