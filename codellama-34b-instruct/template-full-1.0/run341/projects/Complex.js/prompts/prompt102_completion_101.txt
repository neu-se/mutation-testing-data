  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"-" + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add a minus sign to the beginning of the string, even if it is not necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + "-"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add a minus sign to the end of the string, even if it is not necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the minus sign entirely, which could change the sign of the number.

DONE.
