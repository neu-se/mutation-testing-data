  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `drain` is a function that returns a stream, while the new code fragment `drain.pipe(process.stdout)` is a method call that pipes the stream to the standard output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(process.stderr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment `drain.pipe(process.stderr)` pipes the stream to the standard error output instead of the standard output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment `drain.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'))` pipes the stream to a file called `output.txt` instead of the standard output.

DONE.
