  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.call` is a different method than `call.apply`, and it would cause the function to be called with a different `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.bind` returns a new function that is bound to a specific `this` value, whereas `call.call` and `call.apply` call the function immediately with the specified `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
call.apply.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `call.apply.bind` returns a new function that is bound to a specific `this` value, whereas `call.call` and `call.apply` call the function immediately with the specified `this` value.

DONE.
