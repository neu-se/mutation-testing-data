  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content) && content.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `content` is a buffer, while the new code fragment also checks if the buffer has a length greater than 0. This change would cause the `stripBom` function to behave differently if the input `content` is a buffer with a length of 0.

DONE.
