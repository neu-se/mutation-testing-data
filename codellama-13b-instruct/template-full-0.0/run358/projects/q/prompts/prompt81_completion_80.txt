  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue` array would be pushed to, rather than the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick.runAfter
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runAfter` function would be called, rather than the `nextTick` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick.runAfter.call
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on the `runAfter` function, rather than the `nextTick` function.

DONE.
