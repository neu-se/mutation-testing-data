  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks if a value is NaN, and the negation of that check would return `true` for any value that is not NaN, including numbers and other types of values. In the original code, the `isNaN` function is used to check if the result of the calculation is NaN, and if it is, the `parser_exit` function is called to exit the program. By replacing `isNaN` with `!isNaN`, the program would continue executing even if the result of the calculation is NaN, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
