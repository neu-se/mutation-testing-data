  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.index` to reference the current index, while this replacement code uses `this.index + 1` to reference the next index. This could potentially cause the iterator to skip over certain elements in the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.index` to reference the current index, while this replacement code uses `this.index - 1` to reference the previous index. This could potentially cause the iterator to go back and process the same element in the `ops` array again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this.index` to reference the current index, while this replacement code uses `this.ops.length - this.
