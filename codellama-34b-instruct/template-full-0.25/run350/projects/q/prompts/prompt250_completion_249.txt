  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character would be replaced with a tab character, which would change the formatting of the error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character would be replaced with a space character, which would change the formatting of the error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello, world!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the newline character would be replaced with a string of text, which would change the content of the error message.

DONE.
