  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(thisIter.nextIndex())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return a delta with a different set of operations than the original code, which could lead to unexpected results when composing deltas.

DONE.
