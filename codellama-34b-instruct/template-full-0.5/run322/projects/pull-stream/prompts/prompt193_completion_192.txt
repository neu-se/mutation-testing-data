  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `aborted`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `aborted` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator evaluates the left-hand side expression (`aborted`) and, if it is truthy, evaluates the right-hand side expression (`true`) and returns the result. This means that if `aborted` is `true`, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true`, even if the `aborted` variable is not explicitly set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator evaluates the left-hand side expression (`aborted`) and, if it is falsy, evaluates the
