  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function that checks if an object is a promise-like object, meaning it has a `then` method, but it may not be a promise instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` would check if the object is not a promise, which would result in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if the object is a fulfilled promise, which would result in a different behavior than the original code that checks if the object is a promise.

DONE.
