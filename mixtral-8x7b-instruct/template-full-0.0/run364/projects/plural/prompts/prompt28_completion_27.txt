 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last character of the word, instead of considering the special case when the word ends with 'y'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last two characters of the word, regardless of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove a random number of characters from the end of the word, instead of consistently removing the last two characters when the word matches the rule.

DONE.
