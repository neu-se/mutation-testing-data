  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` returns a new array with the elements of the original array, whereas `slice` returns a new array with a subset of the elements of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` changes the original array, whereas `slice` does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the filter function, whereas `slice` returns a new array with a subset of the elements of the original array.

DONE.
