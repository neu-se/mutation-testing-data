  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator would cause the retain value to be increased, potentially resulting in the wrong number of characters being retained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the * operator would cause the retain value to be multiplied, potentially resulting in a much larger or smaller number of characters being retained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain / firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the / operator would cause the retain value to be divided, potentially resulting in a much smaller number of characters being retained.

DONE.
