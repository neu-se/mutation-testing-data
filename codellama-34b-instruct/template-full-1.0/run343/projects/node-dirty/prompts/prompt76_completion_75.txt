  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a count of 1 instead of 0, which could cause unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the `load` event to indicate the number of entries in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a null value instead of a count of 0, which could cause unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the `load` event to indicate the number of entries in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with the actual size of the data instead of 0, which could cause unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the `load` event to indicate the number of entries in the database.

DONE.
