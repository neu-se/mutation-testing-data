  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `+` operator to concatenate the two strings, while the replacement code fragment uses the `+` operator to perform arithmetic addition on the numbers `1` and `1`, resulting in the value `2`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello" + "world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `+` operator to concatenate the two strings, while the replacement code fragment uses the `+` operator to perform string concatenation on the two strings, resulting in the string `"helloworld"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used the `+` operator to concatenate the two strings, while the replacement code fragment uses the `+` operator to perform string concatenation on the string `"hello"` and the number `1`, resulting in
