  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (Q === 0) {
    return object.dispatch("not", args);
} else {
    return object.dispatch("post", [name, args]);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if Q is equal to 0 and if it is, it would call the "not" method instead of "post".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object.dispatch("post", [name, args]).delay();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object.dispatch("post", [name, args]).then(function(result) {
    return result * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result by 2.

DONE.
