  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.next` advances the iterator to the next operation and returns the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.next` advances the iterator to the next operation and returns the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(other.ops).next
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new iterator for the `other` delta and advances it to the next operation, while the original code uses the existing iterator for the `this` delta.

DONE.
