  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which requires both `_a` and `_b` to be less than 3000, while the new code fragment uses the logical OR operator `||`, which only requires one of the two conditions to be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which requires both `_a` and `_b` to be less than 3000, while the new code fragment uses the logical AND operator `&&`, which requires `_a` to be less than 3000 and `_b` to be greater than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 300
