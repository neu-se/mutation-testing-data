 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function, which might have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments).slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it treats `arguments` as an object and gets its keys, then slices the keys array, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function, which might have a different implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.slice` method directly, which might have a different implementation or behavior than the `array_slice` function used in the original code.

DONE.
