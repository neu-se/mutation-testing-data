  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.apply` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString.call`, and it has a different behavior when called with the same arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.bind` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString.call`, and it has a different behavior when called with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.valueOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.toString.call`, and it has a different behavior when called with the same arguments.

DONE.
