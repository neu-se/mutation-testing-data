  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.next();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return the next operation in the iterator, which could be a different operation than the one that was intended to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return thisIter.previous();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return the previous operation in the iterator, which could be a different operation than the one that was intended to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return null, which could cause the code that calls this method to behave differently.

DONE.
