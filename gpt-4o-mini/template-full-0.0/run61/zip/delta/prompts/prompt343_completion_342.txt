Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandlerWrong
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a non-existent or incorrect function, which would lead to a runtime error instead of executing the intended handler logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType + 'Wrong')
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `embedType` string, potentially causing the handler lookup to fail, leading to incorrect transformations or no transformations being applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType).incorrectMethod()
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call a method that does not exist on the handler object, resulting in a runtime error and preventing the transformation logic from executing correctly.

DONE.
