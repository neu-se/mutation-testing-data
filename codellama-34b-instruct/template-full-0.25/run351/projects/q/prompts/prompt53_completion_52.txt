  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object and has a `toString` method that returns `"[object process]"`, while this new code fragment simply checks if `process` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` has a `nextTick` method, while this new code fragment checks if `process.nextTick` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process.toString() === "[object process]" && process.nextTick !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process.nextTick` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks if it is not undefined.
