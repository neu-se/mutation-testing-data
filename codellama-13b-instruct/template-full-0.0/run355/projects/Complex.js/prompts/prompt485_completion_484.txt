  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'object' && exports !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if the `exports` variable is an object, and the `!== null` check is added to ensure that the `exports` variable is not null. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `exports` variable is not an object or is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'object' || exports !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if the `exports` variable is an object, and the `!== null` check is added to ensure that the `exports` variable is not null. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `exports` variable is not an object or is null.
