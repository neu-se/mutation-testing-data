Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the complex number is zero instead of checking if it is NaN, which would lead to incorrect string representation for complex numbers that are not zero but contain NaN values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']() && this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines two checks, returning true only if both conditions are met, which is logically inconsistent with the original intent of checking for NaN values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly checks if both the real and imaginary parts are zero, which does not accurately determine if the complex number is NaN, potentially leading to incorrect string output for complex numbers that are not NaN.

DONE.
