  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of the value of the promise, which may not be what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the promise in the array instead of the value of the promise, which may not be what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise instead of the promise object itself, which may not be what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
