  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`. In the original code, `null` is used as a marker to indicate that the drain function has completed, but `undefined` would be interpreted as a valid value and the function may not behave as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", done
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is truthy, while `null` is falsy. This could cause the `drain` function to be called with an unexpected argument, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, done
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is falsy, while `null` is truthy. This could cause the `drain` function to be called with an unexpected argument, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
