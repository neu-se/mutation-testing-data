  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, `a` is not null, but it is an object, so the `typeof` operator would return "object", while the `===` operator would return false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the variable, while the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality. In this case, `a` is not undefined, but it is an object, so the `typeof` operator would return "object", while the `!==` operator would return true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property returns the constructor function of the object, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality
