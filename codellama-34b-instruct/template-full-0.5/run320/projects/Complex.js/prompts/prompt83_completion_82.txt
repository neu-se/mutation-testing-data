  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, which means the number is positive. However, if we change it to `plus + minus === 1`, it would check if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 1, which means the number is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to 0, which means the number is positive. However, if we change it to `plus + minus === -1`, it would check if `plus` and `minus` are both equal to -1, which means the number is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `plus` and `minus
