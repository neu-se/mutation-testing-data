 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not pass the `abort` argument to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes no arguments to the `cb` function, whereas this replacement passes the boolean value `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.apply(this, [abort])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with no arguments and in the current context, whereas this replacement passes the `abort` argument and sets the context to the current object.

DONE.
