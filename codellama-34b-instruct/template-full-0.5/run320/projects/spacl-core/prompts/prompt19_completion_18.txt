  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length >= 1 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `string.length` check would allow the matcher to match a string with a length of 1, which would not be matched by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 0 && string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `string.length` check would allow the matcher to match a string with a length of 0, which would not be matched by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 || string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `string.length` check would allow the matcher to match a string with a length greater than 1, which would not be matched by the original code.

DONE.
