  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob()` function is checking if the `src` variable is a glob pattern, and the `!` operator inverts the result, so if `src` is not a glob pattern, the function will return `true` and the code inside the `if` statement will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(src && isGlob(src))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement checks if `src` is truthy and `isGlob(src)` is `true`, so the code inside the `if` statement will only be executed if `src` is a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob()` function is called with the arguments `(src, true)`, which means that it will always return `true` for
