  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the next operation is a retain operation, rather than a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the next operation is an insert operation, rather than a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete' && thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the next operation is a delete operation with a length greater than 0, rather than just checking if it's a delete operation.

DONE.
