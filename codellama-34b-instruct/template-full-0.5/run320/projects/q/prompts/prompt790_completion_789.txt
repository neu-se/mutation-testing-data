  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `void 0`, and could potentially cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a distinct value from `void 0`, and could potentially cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a distinct value from `void 0`, and could potentially cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
