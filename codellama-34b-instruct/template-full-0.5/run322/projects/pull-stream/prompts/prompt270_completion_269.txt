  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `stream` is a function. This change would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called even if `stream` is not an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'array' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `stream` is an array. This change would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called even if `stream` is not an array, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream && 'number' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `
