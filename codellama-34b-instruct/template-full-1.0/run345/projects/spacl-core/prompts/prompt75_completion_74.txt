  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method returns a boolean or null, not a number. Therefore, the statement `res === 1` would always be false, even if the rule matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.includes(res)
```
This would result in different behavior because `res` is a single rule, not an array of rules, so the `includes` method would always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.name == 'allowed'
```
This would result in different behavior because `res` is a single rule, not a string, so the `name` property would always be null.

DONE.
