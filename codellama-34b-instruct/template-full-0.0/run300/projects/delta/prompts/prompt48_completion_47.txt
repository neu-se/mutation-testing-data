  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `embedType` is not equal to the first key in `b`, regardless of whether `b` has any keys or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).includes(embedType)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is included in the keys of `b`, regardless of whether `b` has any keys or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length > 0 && embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `b` has at least one key and `embedType` is not equal to the first key in `b`.

DONE.
