  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.ope
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter` is an `OpIterator` instance, and `iter.ope` is not a valid method or property of the `OpIterator` class, so it would throw a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ope
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Delta` instance, and `this.ope` is not a valid method or property of the `Delta` class, so it would throw a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ope
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` refers to the `Delta` instance that is being transformed, and `other.ope` is not a valid method or property of the `Delta` class, so it would throw a syntax error.

DONE.
