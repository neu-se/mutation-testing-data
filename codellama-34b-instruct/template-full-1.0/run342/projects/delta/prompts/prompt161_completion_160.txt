  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from `this` onto the `delta` rather than the corresponding operation from `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const op = otherIter.next();
delta.push(op.insert ? op : { insert: op.delete });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from `other` onto the `delta` and if it is an insert operation, it would be pushed as is, but if it is a delete operation, it would be pushed as an insert operation with the same length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const op = otherIter.next();
delta.push({ insert: op.insert, attributes: op.attributes });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from `other` onto the `delta` and if it is an insert operation, it would be
