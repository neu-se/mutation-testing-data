  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `task` function, which would be replaced with `undefined`, causing the `runSingle` function to throw an error when it tries to call the `undefined` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `task` function, which would be replaced with `null`, causing the `runSingle` function to throw an error when it tries to call the `null` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `task` function, which would be replaced with `0`, causing the `runSingle` function to throw an error when it tries to call the `0` function.

DONE.
