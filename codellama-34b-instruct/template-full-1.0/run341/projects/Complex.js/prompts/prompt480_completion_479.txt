  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would be called with `this`, which could potentially have different behavior if `this` is not the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']('0')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would be called with a different argument, potentially causing a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'] !== Complex['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would be called on different objects, potentially causing a different return value.

DONE.
