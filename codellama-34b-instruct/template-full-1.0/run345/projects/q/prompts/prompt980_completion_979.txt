  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a resolver, but `null` is not a function and would not resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a resolver, but `undefined` is not a function and would not resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return deferred.makeNodeResolver().resolve(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a function that returns the resolver, but the new code fragment returns a function that returns a resolved promise.

DONE.
