  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the `re` property is the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` property is the absolute value of the complex number, whereas the `re` property is the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is the argument (angle) of the complex number, whereas the `re` property is the real part.

DONE.
