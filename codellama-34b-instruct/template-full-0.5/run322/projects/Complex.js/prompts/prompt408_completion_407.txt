  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-temp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would negate the value of `temp`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `temp`, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `temp` by 0, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
