  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is different than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key + 1, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the property being set is different than the original property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is different than the original value.

DONE.
