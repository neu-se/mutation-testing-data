  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is used to indicate that all queued data has been written, while the `error` event is used to indicate that an error occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` event is used to indicate that new data is available, while the `drain` event is used to indicate that all queued data has been written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is used to indicate that the end of the file has been reached, while the `drain` event is used to indicate that all queued data has been written.

DONE.
