  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exp` function is not the same as `cosh` and would produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is not the same as `cosh` and would produce different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function is not the same as `cosh` and would produce different results.

DONE.
