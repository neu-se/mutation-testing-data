Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which may lead to unexpected results when used in a context that expects an object, potentially causing runtime errors or different promise behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because using `this` would refer to the current promise context instead of the global context, which could lead to incorrect behavior when trying to bind the function to a specific context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a specific type of value that can lead to different handling in promise chains, potentially causing issues with promise resolution or rejection that would not occur with `void 0`.

DONE.
