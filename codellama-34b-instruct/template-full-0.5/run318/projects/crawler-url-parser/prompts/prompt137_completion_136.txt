  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the replacement code fragment is a string that contains a backslash followed by a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\s'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the replacement code fragment is a string that contains a backslash followed by the letter "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\d'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a regular expression that matches a forward slash, while the replacement code fragment is a string that contains a backslash followed by the letter "d".

DONE.
