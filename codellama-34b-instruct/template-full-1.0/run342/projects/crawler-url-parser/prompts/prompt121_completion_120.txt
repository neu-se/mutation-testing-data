  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from()` is a function that creates a new array from an array-like or iterable object, whereas `x => x` is a function that simply returns its input without modifying it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}.from()
```
This would result in different behavior because `from()` is a function that is only defined on the `Array` prototype, and it is used to create a new array from a given iterable or iterable-like object. Calling `from()` on a plain object would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
([...])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `[...]` syntax is used to create a new array from an existing array or array-like object, whereas `x => x` is a function that simply returns its input without modifying it.

DONE.
