  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the pattern, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match case-insensitively, so it would also match the string "//" in addition to "//".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match across multiple lines, so it would also match the string "//" in addition to "//".

DONE.
