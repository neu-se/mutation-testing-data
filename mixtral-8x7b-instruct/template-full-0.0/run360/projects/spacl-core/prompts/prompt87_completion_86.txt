 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
rule.clone(rule.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original rule's name instead of a new name for the cloned rule, potentially causing issues if the rule names need to be unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
new Policy(name)
