 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
makeStackTraceLong = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function would no longer throw an error, but instead use an empty function, effectively suppressing any errors passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
makeStackTraceLong = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function would treat `makeStackTraceLong` as a boolean value, causing the function to always return `reject(exception)` without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
makeStackTraceLong = 'not a function';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function would treat `makeStackTraceLong` as a string value, causing the function to always return `reject(exception)` without throwing an error.

DONE.
