  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while `options.dest.split('/').pop()` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while `options.dest.substr(1)` is a substring of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options.dest` is a string, while `options.dest.toLowerCase()` is a string with all characters in lowercase.

DONE.
