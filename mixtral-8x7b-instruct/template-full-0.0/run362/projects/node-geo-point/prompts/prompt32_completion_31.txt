 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * deg2rad(point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the calculation result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.asin` function directly instead of the `asin` constant, potentially changing the result due to differences in rounding or implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.atan` function instead of the `atan2` function, which could lead to incorrect results when the input arguments have opposite signs.

DONE.
