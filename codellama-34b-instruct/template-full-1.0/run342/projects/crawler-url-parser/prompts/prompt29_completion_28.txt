  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hostname` property is the full hostname without the protocol or port, whereas `host` includes the protocol and port.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property includes the port, which may cause the URL to not be properly resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not defined on the `baseUrl` object.

DONE.
