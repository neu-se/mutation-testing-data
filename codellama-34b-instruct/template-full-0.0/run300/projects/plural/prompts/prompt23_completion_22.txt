  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a word with the "i" changed to "ies", while this new code fragment would return a word with the "i" changed to "es".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a word with the "i" changed to "ies", while this new code fragment would return a word with the "i" changed to "us".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
