  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the promise to be rejected, whereas the original code would resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that resolves to the value, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the value directly.

DONE.
