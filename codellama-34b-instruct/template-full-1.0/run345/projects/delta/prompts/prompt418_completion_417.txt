  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it updates the offset variable with the length of the current operation minus one, which would cause the offset to be incorrect in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset = length - offset;
```
This would result in different behavior because it updates the offset variable with the difference between the length of the current operation and the current offset, which would cause the offset to be incorrect in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset = Math.min(offset, length - offset);
```
This would result in different behavior because it updates the offset variable with the minimum of the current offset and the difference between the length of the current operation and the current offset, which would cause the offset to be incorrect in some cases.

DONE.
