  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(null), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `updater` function is called with the value of the key as an argument, whereas in the modified code, it is called with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key.toString())), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `updater` function is called with the value of the key as an argument, whereas in the modified code, it is called with the stringified version of the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this._data.get(key)), cb
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `updater` function is called with the value of the key as an argument, whereas in the modified code, it is called with the value of the key as stored in the `_data
