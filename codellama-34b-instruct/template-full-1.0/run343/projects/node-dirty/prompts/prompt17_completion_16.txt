  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `key` is set to `undefined` if no value is provided, while in the mutated code, it is set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `key` is set to `undefined` if no value is provided, while in the mutated code, it is set to `undefined + 1`, which is always `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `key` is set to `undefined` if no value is provided, while in the mutated code, it is set to `undefined` regardless of whether a value is provided or not.

DONE.
