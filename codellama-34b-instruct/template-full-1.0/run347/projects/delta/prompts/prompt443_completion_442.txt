  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is being used to determine the length of the string that should be returned by the `substr` method, and `offset` is the starting position of the substring that should be returned. Using `length - offset` would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is being used to determine the length of the string that should be returned by the `substr` method, and `length * 2` would result in a different length being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is being used to determine the length of the string that should be returned by the `substr` method, and `length - 1` would result in a different length being used.

DONE.
