Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(zipAFolderOptions instanceof Object) || (zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `zipAFolderOptions` is not an object, the modified code would use the default output stream, while the original code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to
