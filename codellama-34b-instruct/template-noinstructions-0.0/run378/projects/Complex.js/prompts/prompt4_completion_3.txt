  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a bug that causes it to always return 0, while the replaced code fragment would return a non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a bug that causes it to always return 0, while the replaced code fragment would return a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a bug that causes it to always return 0, while the replaced code fragment would return a non-zero value.

DONE.
