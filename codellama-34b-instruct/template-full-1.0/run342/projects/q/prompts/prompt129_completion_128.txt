  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(i);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the current value of the loop counter `i` onto the `keys` array, while this modified code pushes the value of `i` plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the current value of the loop counter `i` onto the `keys` array, while this modified code pushes a random number onto the `keys` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keys.push(this[i]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushes the current value of the loop counter `i` onto the `keys` array, while this modified code pushes the value of the `i`th property of the `this` object onto the `keys` array.

DONE.
