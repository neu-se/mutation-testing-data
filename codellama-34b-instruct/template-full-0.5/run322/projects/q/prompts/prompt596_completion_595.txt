  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` would be `null` instead of the expected value, which could cause errors or unexpected results in the code that uses it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` would be `undefined` instead of the expected value, which could cause errors or unexpected results in the code that uses it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` would be an empty object instead of the expected value, which could cause errors or unexpected results in the code that uses it.

DONE.
