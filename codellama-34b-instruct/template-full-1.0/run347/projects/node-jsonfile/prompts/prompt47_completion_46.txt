  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = jsonfile;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `module.exports` object with a new object, instead of adding the `jsonfile` object to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
jsonfile = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `jsonfile` variable to `null`, instead of adding the `jsonfile` object to the `module.exports` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
jsonfile.readFile = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `readFile` method of the `jsonfile` object with a new function that doesn't perform any file reading, instead of adding the existing `readFile` method from the `universalify` module.

DONE.
