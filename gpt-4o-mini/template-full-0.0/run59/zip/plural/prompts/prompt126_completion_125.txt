Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow pluralization when `num` is exactly 1, which is the opposite of the intended logic that pluralizes for all cases except when `num` is 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat any number less than 1 (including 0) as a case for pluralization, which is not the intended behavior since the original logic only checks for the specific case of `num` being 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow pluralization when `num` is undefined, ignoring the case when `num` is 1, which is necessary for correct pluralization logic.

DONE.
