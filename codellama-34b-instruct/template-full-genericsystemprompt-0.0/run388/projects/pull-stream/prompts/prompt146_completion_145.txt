  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `values` is a custom function that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(object).length` returns the number of keys in the object, while `values` is a custom function that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries(object)` returns an array of the key-value pairs of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `values` is a custom function that is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
