  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because a different set of words would be used to create the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')es\\b', 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match words that end with "es" instead of "s".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new RegExp('\\b(?:' + tools.concat(clothes, games, illnesses, misc).join('|') + ')s\\b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would not match words that end with "s" in a case
