  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|fungus|cactus/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "focus" is missing in the new regex.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the "i" flag is added, causing the regex to match regardless of case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag is added, causing the regex to match every occurrence in the input string instead of just the first one.

DONE.
