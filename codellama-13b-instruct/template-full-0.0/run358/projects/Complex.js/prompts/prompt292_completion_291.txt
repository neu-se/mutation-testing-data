  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a + 1` is not equal to `a` for all values of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a - 1` is not equal to `a` for all values of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a * 2` is not equal to `a` for all values of `a`.

DONE.
