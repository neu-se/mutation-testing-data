  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed` is always `true`, while `!cbed` would be `false` when `cbed` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbed && false` is always `false`, while `!cbed` would be `true` when `cbed` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!cbed || true` is always `true`, while `!cbed` would be `false` when `cbed` is `true`.

DONE.
