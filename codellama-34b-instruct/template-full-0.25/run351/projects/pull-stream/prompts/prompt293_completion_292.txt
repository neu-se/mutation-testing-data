  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is a string. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a non-zero number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is equal to zero. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are zero or negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a non-negative number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is less than zero. This change would cause the function to behave differently for inputs that are negative numbers.

DONE.
