  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different result when `a` or `b` is zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different result when `a` is zero and `b` is not zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b === 0
```
This change will cause the function to return a different result when `a` is not zero and `b` is zero, which may cause issues in the test suite.

DONE.
