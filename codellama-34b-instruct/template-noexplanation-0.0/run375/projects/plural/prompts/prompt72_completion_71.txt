  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This will cause the `plural` function to return the same value as the original code fragment, which is `'cellos'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This will cause the `plural` function to return the value `'cellos'`, which is the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 'es'
```
This will cause the `plural` function to return the value `'cellos'`, which is the same as the original code fragment.

DONE.
