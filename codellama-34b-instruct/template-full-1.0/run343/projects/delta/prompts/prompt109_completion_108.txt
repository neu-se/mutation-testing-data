  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
predicate != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for exact equality, while the `&&` operator checks for truthy or falsy values. `null` is a falsy value, so `predicate != null` would return `false` if `predicate` is `null`, while `predicate !== null` would return `true`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
predicate !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!= true` would return `true` if `predicate` is `false` or any other falsy value, while `!== true` would only return `true` if `predicate` is strictly `true` and not any other truthy value.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
predicate !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!== Object` would return `true` if `predicate` is not
