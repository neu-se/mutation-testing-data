  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's property keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, whereas `Object.values` and `Object.keys` both return arrays of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype` is the object prototype that is used to create objects, whereas `Object.values` and `Object.keys` are methods that operate on objects.

DONE.
