  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the current stream object, while `stream + 1` would result in a new stream object that is one element ahead of the original stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the current stream object, while `stream.slice(1)` would result in a new stream object that contains all the elements of the original stream except for the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(function(x) { return x !== null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `stream` is a reference to the current stream object, while `stream.filter(function(x) { return x !== null; })` would result in a new stream object that contains all the non-null elements of
