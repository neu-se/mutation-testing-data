  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `length` is equal to `0`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `length` is equal to `0`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === Infinity
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `length` is equal to `Infinity`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
