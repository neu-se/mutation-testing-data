  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/b/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it will replace the letter "b" with "e" instead of "a" like the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/(\w)(\w)/, '$2$1') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches and replaces two consecutive word characters in the input string with their reverse order, whereas the original code fragment only replaced the first occurrence of "a" with "e".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/([a-zA-Z])/, '$1$1') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches and replaces a single letter in the input string with itself followed by another copy of the same letter, whereas the original code fragment
