  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last character of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last two characters of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

DONE.
