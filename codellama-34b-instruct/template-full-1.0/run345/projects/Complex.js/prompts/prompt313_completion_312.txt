  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the sinh function to the sin function, which would produce different results for the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the cosh function to the cos function, which would produce different results for the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the tanh function to the tan function, which would produce different results for the complex number.

DONE.
