 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `baseUrlStr` is not provided, the code will not add 'http://' as a prefix to `currentUrlStr` when it doesn't match the specific regex pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the third argument of the `URL.parse` method from `true` (parse query string) to `2` (don't parse query string), affecting how the `baseUrlStr` is parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the second and third arguments of the `URL.parse` method, changing the parsing behavior of the `baseUrlStr`.

DONE.
