  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "1" to the `dest` variable, which would change the destination file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `dest` variable to uppercase, which would change the destination file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `dest` variable on the "." character and return the first part of the string, which would change the destination file name.

DONE.
