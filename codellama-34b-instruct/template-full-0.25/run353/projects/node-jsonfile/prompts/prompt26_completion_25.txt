  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result, potentially causing the `readFile` function to return a different object than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result, potentially causing the `readFile` function to return a different object than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.reviver - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `JSON.parse` method to return a different result, potentially causing the `readFile` function to return a different object than expected.

DONE.
