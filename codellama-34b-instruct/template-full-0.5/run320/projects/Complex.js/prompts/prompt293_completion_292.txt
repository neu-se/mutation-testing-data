  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of `cosh(b)`, which would cause the `log` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would subtract 1 from the result of `cosh(b)`, which would cause the `log` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(2 * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(2 * b)` would be a different value than `cosh(b)`, which would cause the `log` function to return a different value.

DONE.
