 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"[object GlobalError]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the string comparison for identifying a Node.js error, potentially causing incorrect stack filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a global flag (g) to the regular expression, causing it to match all occurrences instead of stopping after the first match, which might lead to incorrect stack filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the regular expression with null, causing an exception in the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function, which might lead to incorrect stack filtering or complete failure of the function.

DONE.
