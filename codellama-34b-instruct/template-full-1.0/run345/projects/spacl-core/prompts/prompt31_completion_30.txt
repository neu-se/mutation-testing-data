  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra slash at the end would cause the regex to only match if the string ends with a slash, whereas the original code fragment would match if the string ends with a slash or is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `#` symbol is not a valid regex metacharacter, and would cause the regex to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` symbol is a quantifier in regex that matches zero or one occurrences of the preceding character, whereas the original code fragment would match one or more occurrences of the preceding character.

DONE.
