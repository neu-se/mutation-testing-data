  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test.test` function is not case-sensitive, as it will return a different result for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test.test` function does not handle arrays correctly, as it will return a different result for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This change will cause the test to fail if the `test.test` function does not handle the `length` property correctly, as it will return a different result for the same input.

DONE.
