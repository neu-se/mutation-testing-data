  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`, instead of a promise that is resolved with the value of the `progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`, instead of a promise that is resolved with the value of the `progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("oops")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would return a promise that is rejected with an error, instead of a promise that is resolved with the value of the `progressed` function.

DONE.
