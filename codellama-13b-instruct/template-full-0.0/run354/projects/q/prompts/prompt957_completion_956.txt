  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfapply` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error if used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfbind
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nfbind` function is not defined in the original code, and therefore would cause an error if used.

DONE.
