  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `true`, even if the complex number is not finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, even if the complex number is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isFinite` function to always return `false`, even if the complex number is finite.

DONE.
