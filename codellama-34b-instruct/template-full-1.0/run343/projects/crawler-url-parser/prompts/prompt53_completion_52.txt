  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `URL.resolve` are swapped, which can cause a different URL to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl, parseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `URL.resolve` is changed from `parsedUrl` to `parseUrl`, which could potentially return a different URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, parsedUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument to `URL.resolve` is changed from `parsedBaseUrl` to `null`, which could potentially return a different URL or cause an error.

DONE.
