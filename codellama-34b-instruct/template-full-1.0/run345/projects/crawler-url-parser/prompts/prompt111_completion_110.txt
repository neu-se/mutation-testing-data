  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr == " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr == ""` check would evaluate to `false`, allowing the code to proceed with parsing the base URL, but the `URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)` method would throw an error because an empty string is not a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr == "/" 
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr == ""` check would evaluate to `true`, allowing the code to proceed with parsing the base URL, but the `URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)` method would throw an error because a URL starting with `"/"` is not a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr == ":"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr == ""` check would evaluate to `false`, allowing the code to proceed with parsing the base URL,
