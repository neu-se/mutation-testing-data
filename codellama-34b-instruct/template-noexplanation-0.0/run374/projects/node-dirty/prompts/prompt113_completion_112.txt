  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size + 1);
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is relying on the correct value of `this._data.size`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', this._data.size - 1);
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is relying on the correct value of `this._data.size`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('load', 0);
```
This change will cause the `load` event to be emitted with a value of 0, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is relying on the correct value of `this._data.size`.

DONE.
