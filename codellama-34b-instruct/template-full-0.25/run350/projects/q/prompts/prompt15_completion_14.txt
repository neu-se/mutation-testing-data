  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isNodeJS = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeJS` variable to be `true`, which would trigger the `if (isNodeJS)` block and execute the code inside it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isNodeJS = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeJS` variable to be `false`, which would skip the `if (isNodeJS)` block and execute the code outside of it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var isNodeJS = !isNodeJS;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the value of the `isNodeJS` variable, causing the `if (isNodeJS)` block to be executed if it was previously `false`, and skipped if it was previously `true`.

DONE.
