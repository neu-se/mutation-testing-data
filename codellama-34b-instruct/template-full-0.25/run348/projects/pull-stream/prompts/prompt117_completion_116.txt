  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of 2, while the new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length less than 2. This change would cause the function to behave differently when the `arguments` object has a length of 2 or more.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of 2, while the new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length greater than 2. This change would cause the function to behave differently when the `arguments` object has a length of 2 or less.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a length of 2, while
