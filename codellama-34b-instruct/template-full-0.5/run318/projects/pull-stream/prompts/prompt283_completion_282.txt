  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, mapper(data))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `mapper` function to the `data` value, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply passes the `data` value to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` value to the `cb` function, which is not what the original code does. The original code passes the `data` value to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the `data` value before passing it to the `cb` function, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply passes the `data` value to the `cb` function.

DONE.
