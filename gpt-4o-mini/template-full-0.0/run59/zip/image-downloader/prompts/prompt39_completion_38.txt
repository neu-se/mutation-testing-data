Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('File could not be saved.'));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise when the file is successfully written, it rejects the promise with a new error, indicating that the file could not be saved, which would lead to the calling code not receiving the expected success response.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ success: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise with an object indicating failure instead of a successful completion, which may lead the calling code to incorrectly interpret the operation as unsuccessful even though the file was written correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('File saved successfully.');
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs a message to the console instead of resolving the promise, which means the promise remains pending and the calling code will not receive any indication of success, potentially causing it to hang or timeout.

DONE.
