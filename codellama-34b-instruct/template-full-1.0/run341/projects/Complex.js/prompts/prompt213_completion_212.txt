  
Option 1: The
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would
result in different behavior because it would introduce an offset of 1 in the
calculation, which would change the final result.


Option 2: The
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would
result in different behavior because it would introduce a multiplication
operation, which would change the final result.

Option 3: The
PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would
result in different behavior because it would introduce a division operation,
which would change the final result.

DONE.
