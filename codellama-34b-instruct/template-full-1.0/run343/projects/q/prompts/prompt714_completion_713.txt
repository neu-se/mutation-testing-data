  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` always returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a method that resolves a promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object that can be used to create a promise, whereas `Q` is a constructor function that creates a new promise.

DONE.
