  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `index` by one, which would affect the iteration over the array. If the original code expects to iterate over the entire array, using `index + 1` would skip every other element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset `index` to zero every time it is called, which would cause the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement `index` by one, which would cause the loop to iterate over every second element of the array.

DONE.
