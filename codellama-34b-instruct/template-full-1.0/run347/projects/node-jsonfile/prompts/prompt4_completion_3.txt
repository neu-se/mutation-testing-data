  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `options` object to the `fs.readFile()` method, but replacing it with `null` would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{encoding: 'utf8'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `options` object to the `fs.readFile()` method, but replacing it with an object literal with a single property `encoding` set to `'utf8'` would result in the file being read with the specified encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{throws: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `options` object to the `fs.readFile()` method with the `throws` property set to `true`, but replacing it with an object literal with the `throws` property set to `false` would result in the file being read
