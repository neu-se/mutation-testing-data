  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return `true` for a path that is governed by the policy, but the action is explicitly denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return `true` for a path that is not governed by the policy, but the action is explicitly allowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to return `true` for a path that is not governed by the policy, but the combination of path and action is not governed by the policy.

DONE.
