  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(length - (firstLeft - firstOther.retain))
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes into account the length of the remaining operations in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - (firstLeft - firstOther.retain))
```
This would result in different behavior because it advances the iteration by the specified length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it indicates that there are no more operations to iterate over.

DONE.
