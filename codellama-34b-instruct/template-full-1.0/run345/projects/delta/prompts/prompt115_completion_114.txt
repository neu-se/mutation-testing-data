  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator is changed from 0 to 1, which would cause the first iteration of the reduce function to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator is changed from 0 to "hello", which would cause the first iteration of the reduce function to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of the accumulator is changed from 0 to null, which would cause the first iteration of the reduce function to produce a different result.

DONE.
