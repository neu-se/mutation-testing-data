  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.\//.test(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match URLs that begin with a dot ('.') followed by a forward slash ('/'), whereas the original code fragment would match URLs that either begin with a protocol (e.g. 'http://') or a non-empty string that does not contain a colon (':').

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!/\.\./.test(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match URLs that do not contain two consecutive dots ('.'), whereas the original code fragment would match URLs that either begin with a protocol or a non-empty string that does not contain a colon.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!\/\\.\//.test(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match URLs that do not contain a backslash ('\') followed by any character, whereas the original code fragment
