  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, rather than just the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the values in the map, rather than just returning the values in the same order.

DONE.
