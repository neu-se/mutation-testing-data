  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a string instead of throwing a `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a string with the value `'Invalid Param1'` instead of throwing a `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a string with the value `'Invalid Param11'` instead of throwing a `SyntaxError`.

DONE.
