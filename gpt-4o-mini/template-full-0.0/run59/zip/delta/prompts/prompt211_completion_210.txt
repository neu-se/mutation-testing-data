Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the `delta` with an empty array instead of a copy of `this.ops`, leading to the loss of all operations from `this` and potentially causing unexpected results in subsequent operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Delta` with the length of `other.ops`, effectively ignoring the operations in `this.ops` and potentially resulting in an incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first operation in `this.ops`, which could lead to incorrect results when composing the two `Delta` objects, as the first operation would be omitted from the resulting `Delta`.

DONE.
