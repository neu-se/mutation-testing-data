 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function checks if the value is a thenable, and `true` is not a thenable. This would cause the `Q(value)` to always return a new promise instead of resolving the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` function checks if the value is a thenable, and `null` is not a thenable. This would cause the `Q(value)` to always return a new promise instead of resolving the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
