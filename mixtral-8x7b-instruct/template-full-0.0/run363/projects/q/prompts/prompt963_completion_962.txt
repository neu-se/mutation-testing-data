 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `unshift` method on an empty array instead of the `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `unshift` method on `null`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `unshift` method on the `Object.prototype`, which would fail and potentially affect other code that relies on the behavior of the `Object.prototype`.

DONE.
