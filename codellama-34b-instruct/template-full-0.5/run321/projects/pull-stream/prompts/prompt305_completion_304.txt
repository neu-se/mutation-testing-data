  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `ended` variable, causing the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended, !cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `cb` variable, causing the `read` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different argument to the `read` function, causing it to behave differently.

DONE.
