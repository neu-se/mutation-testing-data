  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects an array as its first argument, but `unhandledRejections.length` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects an array as its first argument, but `unhandledRejections.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, which may not be the same as the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` expects an array as its first argument, but `unhandledRejections[0]` returns the first element of the array, which may not be the same as the original array.

DONE.
