  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a different bearing value than the original code, which could cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a different bearing value than the original code, which could cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a different bearing value than the original code, which could cause the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
