  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sources.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.keys()` method returns an array of keys of the `sources` object, so the loop would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object instead of the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sources.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.values()` method returns an array of values of the `sources` object, so the loop would iterate over the values of the `sources` object instead of the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sources.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.entries()` method returns an array of `[key, value]` pairs of the `sources` object, so the loop would iterate over the key-value pairs of the `sources` object instead of the values.

DONE.
