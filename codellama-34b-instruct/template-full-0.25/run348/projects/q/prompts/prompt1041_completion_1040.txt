  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next.promise` property would be resolved with the `value` argument, instead of the `next` promise. This would cause the `get` method to return a resolved promise with the `value` argument, instead of a pending promise that resolves with the `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method would be called with a new error object, instead of the `error` argument. This would cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise with the new error object, instead of a pending promise that resolves with the `value` argument.
