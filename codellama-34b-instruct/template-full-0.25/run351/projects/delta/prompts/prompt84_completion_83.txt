  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is not being called, and the `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` objects are not being compared.
