  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially leading to a logic error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once, potentially leading to a logic error.

DONE.
