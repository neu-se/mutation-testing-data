  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is a function, while the new code fragment checks if it is not a function. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is not null, while the new code fragment checks if it is null. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable has a length property, while the new code fragment checks if it has a length of 0. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
