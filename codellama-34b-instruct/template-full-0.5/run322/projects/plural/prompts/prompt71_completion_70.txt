  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `plural` function to convert the word to its plural form, while this new code fragment is simply adding the letter 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `plural` function to convert the word to its plural form, while this new code fragment is simply removing the last letter of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'.replace(/o$/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `plural` function to convert the word to its plural form, while this new code fragment is simply replacing the last letter of the word with a different letter.

DONE.
