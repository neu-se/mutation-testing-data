  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude of the `point` instead of the `distance` between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude of the `point` instead of the `distance` between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.distanceTo(coordinate)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the distance between the `point` and the `coordinate` instead of the `distance` between the two points.

DONE.
