  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!error
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical negation operator `!` flips the truthyness of `error`, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `error.message` is a property of the `error` object that contains a string representation of the error message, and it would still be truthy even if the error message is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof error
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof error` is a string representation of the type of the `error` object, and it would always be truthy.

DONE.
