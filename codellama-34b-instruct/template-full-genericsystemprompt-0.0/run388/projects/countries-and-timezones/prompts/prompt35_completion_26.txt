  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` returns the input value as is, while the modified code fragment `input + 1` returns the input value plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` returns the input value as is, while the modified code fragment `input * 2` returns the input value multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` returns the input value as is, while the modified code fragment `input - 1` returns the input value minus 1.

DONE.
