  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
country[c]
```
This would result in different behavior because `country[c]` is an object representing the country, while `c` is a string representing the ID of the country. Using `country[c]` would return the country object, while using `c` would return the ID of the country as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(c.id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry(c.id)` is a function that takes an ID as an argument and returns the country object, while `c` is an object representing the country. Using `getCountry(c.
