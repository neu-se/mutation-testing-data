  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is not the same as the `options.dest` property, and the code is checking for the presence of the `options.dest` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would change the case of the string, which could affect the outcome of the `path.isAbsolute()` check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would return an array of strings, and the code is checking for the presence of a specific string in the `options.dest` property.

DONE.
