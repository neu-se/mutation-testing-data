  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `false`, even if the input is a valid complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `null`, even if the input is a valid complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ 'value': undefined }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function would return `undefined`, even if the input is a valid complex number.

DONE.
