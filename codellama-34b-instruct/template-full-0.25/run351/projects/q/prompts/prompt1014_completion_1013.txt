  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` would change the value of `this` inside the `makeNodeResolver` function, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply(null)` would change the value of `this` inside the `makeNodeResolver` function, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver().call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call(null)` would change the value of `this` inside the `makeNodeResolver` function, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
