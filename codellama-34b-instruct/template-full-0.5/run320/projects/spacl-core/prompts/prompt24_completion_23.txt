  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 1 || any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `max > 0` check would be skipped, allowing the code to continue even if the `max` variable is not greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 && any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` check would be skipped, allowing the code to continue even if the `any` variable is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > 0 || !any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` check would be inverted, allowing the code to continue even if the `any` variable is false.

DONE.
