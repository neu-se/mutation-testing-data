  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` property is being used instead of the `longitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is being offset by 180 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(coordinate.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `longitude` property is being rounded down to the nearest integer.

DONE.
