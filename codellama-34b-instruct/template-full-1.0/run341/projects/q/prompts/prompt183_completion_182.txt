  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1], Number(attempt1[2]) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the line number by 1, which would cause the filterStackString() function to return a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1], Number(attempt1[2]) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the line number by 1, which would cause the filterStackString() function to return a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1], Number(attempt1[2]) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the line number by 2, which would cause the filterStackString() function to return a different string.

DONE.
