  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This will cause the function to always return a resolved promise, even if the `options.dest` is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('The options.dest is required'))
```
This will cause the function to always return a rejected promise, even if the `options.dest` is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(options.dest)
```
This will cause the function to always return a resolved promise with the value of `options.dest`, even if the `options.dest` is not provided.

DONE.
