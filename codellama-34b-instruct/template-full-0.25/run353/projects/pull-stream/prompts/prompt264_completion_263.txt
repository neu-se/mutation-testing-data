  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string (`''`) is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with an empty string as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `cb` function to be called with `0` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
