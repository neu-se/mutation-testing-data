Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the real part `a` to the imaginary part `b`, which alters the calculation of the angle in the `atan` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets both components to zero, which could lead to a different outcome in the `atan` function, potentially causing a division by zero or returning a different complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from the imaginary part `b` to a constant `1`, which modifies the calculation and could lead to a different result in the `atan` function.

DONE.
