  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation in the other iterator is an insert, while this replacement checks if it is a retain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the delta has any operations, while this replacement checks if the delta has any operations and the last operation is equal to the new operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext() && delta.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the other iterator has no next operation and the delta has any operations, while this replacement checks if the other iterator has no next operation and the delta has any operations and the last operation is equal to the new operation.

DONE.
