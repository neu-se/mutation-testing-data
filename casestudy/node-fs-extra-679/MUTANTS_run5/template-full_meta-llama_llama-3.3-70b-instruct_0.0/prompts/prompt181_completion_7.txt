Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being parsed from the destination's parent directory to the destination itself, potentially affecting the root path comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being parsed from the destination's parent directory to the source directory, altering the root path comparison and potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(destParent, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path being parsed to the parent directory of the destination's parent, which could lead to incorrect comparisons with the source directory and affect the function's logic.

DONE.
