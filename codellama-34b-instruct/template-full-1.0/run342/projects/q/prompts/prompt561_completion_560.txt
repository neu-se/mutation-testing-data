  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reject;
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, and throwing it would cause the promise chain to be rejected, rather than returning a promise that is fulfilled with the rejection value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("fail");
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be thrown, which would not be caught by the existing try-catch block and would cause the function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new InternalServerError(reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error object would be thrown, which would not be caught by the existing try-catch block and would cause the function to fail, and the error object would have a different type than the original rejected promise.

DONE.
