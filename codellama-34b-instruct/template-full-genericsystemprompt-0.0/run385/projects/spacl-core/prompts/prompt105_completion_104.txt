  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string "foo" to the name, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the name to uppercase, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the name, which would cause the `get` method to return a different value.

DONE.
