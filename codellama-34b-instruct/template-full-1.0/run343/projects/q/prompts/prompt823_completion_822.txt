  Option 1: The `makeStackTraceLong` function can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
throw new Error('oops');
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw an error unconditionally, resulting in a rejected promise.

Option 2: The `makeStackTraceLong` function can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return early, without doing any additional processing.

Option 3: The `makeStackTraceLong` function can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
return {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return an object, while the original code fragment returns a promise.

DONE.
