  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap.set()` method to be called with a string value instead of an object, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve the values from the map later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap.set()` method to be called with a string value that is not the same as the original object, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve the values from the map later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap.set()` method to be called with a string value that is not the same as the original object, which would lead to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve the values from the map later.

DONE.
