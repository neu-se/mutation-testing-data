  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `φ2` instead of `φ1` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the latitude of the second point, which could result in a different bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the second point, while `φ1` is the latitude of the first point. Using `λ2` instead of `φ1` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the longitude of the second point, which could result in a different bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, while `φ1` is a variable representing the
