  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0 || b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if b is 0 while the new code fragment checks if b is not 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a ^ b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if b is 0 while the new code fragment uses the XOR operator to check if b is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a == 0 && b == 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if a and b are both 0, while the new code fragment uses the ! operator to check if they are both not 0.

DONE.
