  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a delta with a null attribute map, which would cause the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `attributes` property of the null object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a delta with an undefined attribute map, which would cause the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `attributes` property of the undefined object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would return a delta with an empty attribute map, which would cause the `transform` method to throw an error when trying to access the `attributes` property of the empty object.

DONE.
