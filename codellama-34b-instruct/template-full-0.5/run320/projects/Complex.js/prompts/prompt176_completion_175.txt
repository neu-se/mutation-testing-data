  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.abs` to ensure that the divisor is always positive, while the modified code would use the unmodified value of `c`, which could be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) < d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.abs` to ensure that the divisor is always positive, while the modified code would use the unmodified value of `c`, which could be negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.abs` to ensure that the divisor is always positive, while the modified code would use the unmodified value of `c`, which could be negative.

DONE.
