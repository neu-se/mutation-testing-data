  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `void 0`, which could cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

DONE.
