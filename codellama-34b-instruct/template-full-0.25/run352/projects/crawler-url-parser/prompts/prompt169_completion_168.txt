  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.substring(0, linkurl_path.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method would return a string that is one character shorter than the original string, which could cause the `includes` method to return false even if the substring is present in the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would return a string with all characters in uppercase, which could cause the `includes` method to return false even if the substring is present in the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would return an array of substrings, and the `pop` method would return the last element of the array, which could cause the `includes` method to return false even if the substring is
