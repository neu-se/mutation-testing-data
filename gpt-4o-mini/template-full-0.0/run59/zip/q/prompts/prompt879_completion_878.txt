Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately instead of providing a Node-style callback resolver, which is expected to handle the asynchronous nature of Node functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately instead of allowing the Node function to call back with its result, leading to an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would not provide any callback function to the Node-style function, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior when the function attempts to call the callback.

DONE.
