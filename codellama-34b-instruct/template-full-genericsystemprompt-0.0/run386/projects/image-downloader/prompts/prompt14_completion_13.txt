  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement uses the `toLowerCase()` method to convert the basename to lowercase. This could cause the code to behave differently if the basename contains uppercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the basename to uppercase. This could cause the code to behave differently if the basename contains lowercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while this replacement uses the `split()` method to
