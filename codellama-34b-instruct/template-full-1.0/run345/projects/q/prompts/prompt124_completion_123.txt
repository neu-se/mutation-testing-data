  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(object, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator that inverses the result of the call to `object_hasOwnProperty()`. As a result, the `object_keys()` function would return a different set of keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) && object[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional expression `object[key] === undefined` checks whether the property is undefined. If the property is undefined, the `object_keys()` function would not return the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty(object, key) || object[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional expression `object[key] !== undefined` checks whether the property is not undefined. If the property is not undefined, the `object
