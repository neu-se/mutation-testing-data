  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the number of parts in the link URL is greater than the number of parts in the page URL, which would indicate that the link URL is a sub-URL of the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the number of parts in the link URL is less than the number of parts in the page URL, which would indicate that the link URL is a parent URL of the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true when the number of parts in the link URL is equal to the number of parts in the page URL, which would indicate that the link URL is at the same level as the page URL.

DONE.
