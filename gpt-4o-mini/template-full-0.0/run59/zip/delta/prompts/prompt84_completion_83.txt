Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the code block to execute when the attributes are not equal, potentially leading to incorrect merging of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict inequality instead of equality, which would prevent merging of operations with the same attributes, even if they are logically equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes == lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality, which could lead to unexpected merging of operations due to type coercion, allowing different types to be considered equal.

DONE.
