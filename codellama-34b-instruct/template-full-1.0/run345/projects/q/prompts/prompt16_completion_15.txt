  Sure, I'd be happy to assist with this. Finding bugs in code is a useful skill for any developer, so let's get started!

The first step in mutation testing is to perform a thorough code review to identify potential areas for improvement. During this process, I'll be looking for potential bugs and areas where the code could be improved.

Upon completing the code review, I'll suggest a series of changes to the original code fragment. Once the changes are implemented and the test suite is run, I'll show how the changes affected the test results.

Finally, I'll explain the reasoning behind each change and why it resulted in the observed test outcomes.

So, let's get started!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof window === "object") return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code in the `else` block if the `window` object existed. In the original code fragment, the code in the `else` block would be executed if the `window` object didn't exist (i.
