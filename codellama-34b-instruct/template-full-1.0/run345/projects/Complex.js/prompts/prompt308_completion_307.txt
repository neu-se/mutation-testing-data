  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * c
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * c` would multiply the entire complex number by 2, resulting in a different value than `2 * b`, which only multiplies the imaginary part of the number by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `3 * b` would multiply the imaginary part of the number by 3, resulting in a different value than `2 * b`, which only multiplies the imaginary part of the number by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * c
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * c` would multiply the imaginary part of the number by the real part of the number, resulting in a different value than `2 * b`, which only multiplies the imaginary part of the number by 2.

DONE.
