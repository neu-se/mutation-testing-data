  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to `null` instead of the expected `Policy` object, causing the `query` and `matches` methods to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = new Policy();
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Policy` object would be created instead of using the expected `Policy` object, causing the `query` and `matches` methods to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const policy = policies[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` variable would be set to the first `Policy` object in the `policies` array instead of the expected `Policy` object, causing the `query` and `matches` methods to return incorrect results.

DONE.
