  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the same value for the key, regardless of whether the value is undefined or not. In the original code, the value is only set if it is undefined, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
