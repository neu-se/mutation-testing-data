 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.next.bind(otherIter)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a bound function, which, when called, will use the `this` value of `otherIter`, but it won't pass any arguments. The original code fragment passes the argument `length` to `otherIter.next()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => otherIter.next()
