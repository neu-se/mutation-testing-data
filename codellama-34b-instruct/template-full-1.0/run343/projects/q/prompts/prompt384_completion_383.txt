  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(() => _fulfilled(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is not called with the correct argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(() => reject(new Error()))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is called with a rejected promise, which would cause the `reject` function to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(() => value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is called with a different value than the original `value` parameter.

DONE.
