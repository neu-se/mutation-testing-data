  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is an object, and `self + 1` would attempt to add 1 to the object, which would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is an object, and `self[0]` would attempt to access the first element of the object, which would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is an object, and `self.length` would attempt to access the `length` property of the object, which would result in a `TypeError`.

DONE.
