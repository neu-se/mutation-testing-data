  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator would always be zero, resulting in a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator would be equal to the real component of the complex number, resulting in a division by zero error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the denominator would be equal to the negative of the imaginary component of the complex number, resulting in a division by zero error.

DONE.
