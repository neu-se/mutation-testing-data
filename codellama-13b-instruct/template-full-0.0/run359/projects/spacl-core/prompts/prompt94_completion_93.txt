  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would be called on the `name` property of the `policy` object, which would cause the test to fail if the `name` property is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `name` property of the `policy` object, which would cause the test to fail if the `name` property is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt()` method would be called on the `name` property of the `policy` object, which would cause the test to fail if the `name` property is not a string.

DONE.
