  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `lastOp` is an object, but this new code fragment checks whether it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether the current index is at the end of the `ops` array, but this new code fragment checks whether it is before the second-to-last index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index] === lastOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `lastOp` is equal to the current element in the `ops` array, but this new code fragment checks if it is the same object as the current element.

DONE.
