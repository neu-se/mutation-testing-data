 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `attributes` object, so any nested properties in the original `attributes` object won't be affected by changes made to the copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object if `attributes` is falsy, which might not have the same properties as the original `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(attributes))
