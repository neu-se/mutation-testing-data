  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the `atReport` variable is being checked for equality with `-1`, which would result in a different outcome than the original code.

DONE.
