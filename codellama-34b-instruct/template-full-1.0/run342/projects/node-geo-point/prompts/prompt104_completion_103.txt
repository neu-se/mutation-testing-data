  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would round up to the nearest tile instead of rounding down, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would round to the nearest tile, which could result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x + 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toTile` method would add 0.5 to the longitude before rounding down, which could result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
