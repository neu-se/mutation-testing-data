  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ambientThis
```
This would result in different behavior because `ambientThis` returns the global object, rather than the function that is being called. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
|currentThis
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentThis` returns the function that is being called, rather than the global object. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and cannot be called, while `ambientThis` and `|currentThis` are functions that can be called.

DONE.
