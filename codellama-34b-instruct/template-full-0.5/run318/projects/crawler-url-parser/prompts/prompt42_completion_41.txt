  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^http:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "http://" protocol from the base URL, which could cause the URL parsing to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "https://" protocol from the base URL, which could cause the URL parsing to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^http(s)?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove both the "http://" and "https://" protocols from the base URL, which could cause the URL parsing to fail.

DONE.
