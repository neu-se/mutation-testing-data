  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `num`, even if `num` is equal to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `num`, even if `num` is not equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1 || num === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any value of `num`, even if `num` is not equal to 1.

DONE.
