  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is called with a null value as the first argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is called with the boolean value `false` as the first argument, which would not trigger the error handling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method is called with the number `0` as the first argument, which would not trigger the error handling code.

DONE.
