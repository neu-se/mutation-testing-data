  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections([]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with an empty array, which would clear the `unhandledRejections` array, but not the `unhandledReasons` array. This could cause the `getUnhandledReasons` function to return incorrect information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with `null`, which would cause an error to be thrown. This could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called with `undefined`, which would cause an error to be thrown. This could cause the program to crash or behave
