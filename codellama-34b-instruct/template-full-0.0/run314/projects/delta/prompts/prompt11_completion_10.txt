  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `b` object instead of the `a` object, which could lead to different results in the `compose` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `a` object instead of the `b` object, which could lead to different results in the `compose` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in a) {
  if (a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined) {
    attributes[key] = a[key];
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only iterate over the keys of the `a` object that are also present in the `b` object, and it would only set the value of the `attributes`
