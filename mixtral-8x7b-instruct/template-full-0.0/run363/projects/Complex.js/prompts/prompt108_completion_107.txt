 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === Infinity || z['im'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for infinity instead of checking if the value is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) && isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the values are finite instead of checking if they are NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] !== z['re'] || z['im'] !== z['im']
