  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]y$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now looking for a consonant followed by a 'y', rather than a consonant followed by a 'y' at the end of the word. This would cause the rule to match words that do not end in 'y', such as 'party', which would be pluralized incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]y$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now looking for a consonant followed by a 'y' followed by another consonant, rather than a consonant followed by a 'y' followed by a vowel. This would cause the rule to match words
