  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reduce` method to sum up the lengths of the `Op` objects in the `ops` array, while this replacement code would simply concatenate the `Op` objects as strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reduce` method to sum up the lengths of the `Op` objects in the `ops` array, while this replacement code would sum up the lengths of the `Op` objects as strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reduce` method to sum up the lengths of the `Op` objects in the `ops` array, while this replacement code would
