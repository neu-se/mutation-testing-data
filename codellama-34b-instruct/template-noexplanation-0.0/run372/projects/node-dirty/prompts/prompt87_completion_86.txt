  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift
```
This will cause the first element of the array to be removed instead of the last element, which is the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1)
```
This will cause the first element of the array to be removed and returned as a new array, which is different from the behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 1)
```
This will cause the first element of the array to be removed and returned as a new array, which is different from the behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
