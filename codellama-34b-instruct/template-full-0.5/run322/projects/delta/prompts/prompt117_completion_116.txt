  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the `elem.delete` property as a boolean value, rather than a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the `elem.retain` property as a boolean value, rather than a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the `elem.attributes` property as a boolean value, rather than an object.

DONE.
