  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(0,1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method will return a different value than the original `currentUrlStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method will return a different value than the original `currentUrlStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^[a-zA-Z]*$/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method will return a different value than the original `currentUrlStr`.

DONE.
