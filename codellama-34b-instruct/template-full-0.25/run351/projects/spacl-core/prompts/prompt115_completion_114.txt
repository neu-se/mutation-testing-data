  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice()` creates a new array with a copy of the elements of `verbs`, whereas `verbs` itself is a reference to the original array. If the `deny` method is called with `verbs.slice()` as the argument, it will modify the copy of the array and not the original array, which may not have the intended effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.concat()` creates a new array with the elements of `verbs` and any additional arguments, whereas `verbs` itself is a reference to the original array. If the `deny` method is called with `verbs.concat()` as the argument, it will modify the copy of the array and not the original array, which may not have the intended effect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(
