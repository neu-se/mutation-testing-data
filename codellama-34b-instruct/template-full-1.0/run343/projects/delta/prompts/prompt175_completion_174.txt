  It is crucial to remember that the code under test has some bugs or issues that can be detected by mutation testing. The mutation testing framework should be able to apply those changes and see if the test suite catches them. You have demonstrated that you are a mutation testing expert. You can locate potential issue spots in the code and assess your testing techniques to let you accomplish this.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be changed to:
```
otherIter.peekLength.
```
We call this method on the other iterator because it knows the length of the next operation on the other side. This would cause different outcomes because the current iterator is searching for the next operation, whereas the other iterator is counting it. This could produce incorrect results during operation deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisIter.peek() == 'number'.
```
We use the typeof operator to check that the peak returns umber because that is crucial for the algorithm. This could produce incorrect results since the pointer operation could not be a thenumber.

Option 3: The PLACEH
