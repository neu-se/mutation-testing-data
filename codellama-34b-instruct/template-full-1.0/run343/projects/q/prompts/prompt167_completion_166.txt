  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < lines.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would terminate one iteration earlier, and the last line would not be checked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, and no lines would be checked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.length + i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run forever, and all lines would be checked repeatedly.

DONE.
