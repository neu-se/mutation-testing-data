  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not exit the parser, while the modified code would exit the parser with a return code of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would exit the parser with a return code of 1, while the modified code would exit the parser with a return code of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would exit the parser with a return code of 1, while the modified code would exit the parser with a return code of 2.

DONE.
