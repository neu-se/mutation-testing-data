  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be swapped, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be incremented by 1, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be multiplied by 2, which could cause errors in the calculations.

DONE.
