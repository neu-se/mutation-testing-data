  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace carriage returns instead of newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, '\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace newlines with carriage returns instead of the specified EOL character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all newlines instead of replacing them with the specified EOL character.

DONE.
