  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a number, but the new code fragment would be passing a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a number, but the new code fragment would be passing a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a number, but the new code fragment would be passing a string.

DONE.
