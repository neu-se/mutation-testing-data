  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at index `i` of the `array`, rather than the element at index `k` of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `array`, rather than the element at index `k` of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[k - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the element at index `k - 1` of the `array`, rather than the element at index `k` of the array.

DONE.
