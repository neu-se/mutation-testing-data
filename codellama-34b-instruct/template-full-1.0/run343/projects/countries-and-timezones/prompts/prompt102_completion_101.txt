  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).forEach(key => prev[key] = tzs[key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, while `Object.assign` copies the values of the `tzs` object to a new object. This change would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return an array instead of an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that calls this function.
```
DONE.
