  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the original array, while `stream` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.map(x => x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array with the same length as the original array, while `stream` is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.filter(x => x > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the filter function, while `stream` is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
