  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"state": "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `inspect` method to get the state of the promise, which returns a string representing the state of the promise. By replacing it with a hardcoded string, the promise would always be in the "fulfilled" state, even if it was actually rejected.

DONE.
