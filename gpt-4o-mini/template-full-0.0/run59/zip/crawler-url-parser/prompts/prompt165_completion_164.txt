Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the current URL's path to the link URL's path instead of the page URL's path, potentially leading to incorrect categorization of the link type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the link URL's path to the host of the page URL, which is not a valid comparison for determining the relationship between the URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first part of the link URL's path is included in the page URL's path, which could lead to incorrect classifications of the link type based on a partial match rather than the full path.

DONE.
