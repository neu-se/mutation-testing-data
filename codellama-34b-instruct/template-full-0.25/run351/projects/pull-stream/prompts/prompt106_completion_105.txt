  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `done(null)` is a function call with an argument `null`. This change would cause the function to be called with an unexpected argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `done(undefined)` is a function call with an argument `undefined`. This change would cause the function to be called with an unexpected argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a function that takes no arguments, while the new code fragment `
