  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra `/` at the end of the pattern would cause the match to fail, as the pattern would require a trailing slash in the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` at the end of the pattern would make the trailing slash optional, allowing the match to succeed even if the input string does not have a trailing slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` at the end of the pattern would make the match case-insensitive, allowing the match to succeed even if the input string has a different case than the pattern.

DONE.
