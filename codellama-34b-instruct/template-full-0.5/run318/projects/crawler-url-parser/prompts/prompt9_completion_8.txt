  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the base URL string contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment is checking if the first segment of the base URL string contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the base URL string contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment is checking if the first character of the base URL string contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the base URL string contains illegal characters, while the new code fragment is checking if the base URL string contains illegal characters after removing the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

DONE.
