  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ninvoke` method to dispatch the `post` event on the `this` object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ninvoke` method to dispatch the `post` event on the `this` object with the `arguments` object as the event data, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, [name, nodeArgs])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ninvoke` method to dispatch the `post` event on the `this` object with the `name` and `nodeArgs` arrays as the event data, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
