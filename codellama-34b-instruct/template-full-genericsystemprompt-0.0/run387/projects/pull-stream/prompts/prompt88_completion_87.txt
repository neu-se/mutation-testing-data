  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is a negation of the `prop` variable, which would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `prop` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` would add 1 to the value of `prop`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `prop` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop * 2` would multiply the value of `prop` by 2, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `prop` is falsy.

DONE.
