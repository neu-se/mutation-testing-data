 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other rule in the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to the length of the `rules` array, causing the loop to terminate immediately and not apply any rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets `i` to 0 and then decrements it, causing the loop to not execute at all.

DONE.
