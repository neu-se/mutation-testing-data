  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Write stream closed unexpectedly'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event when the write stream is closed unexpectedly, which could indicate a bug in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'write_close' event when the write stream is closed, which could indicate that the code is trying to close the write stream prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'drain' event when the write stream is closed, which could indicate that the code is trying to close the write stream prematurely.

DONE.
