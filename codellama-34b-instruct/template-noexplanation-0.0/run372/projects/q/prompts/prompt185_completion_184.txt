  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This change will cause the code to use the first element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element, which may result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This change will cause the code to use the third element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element, which may result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[0]
```
This change will cause the code to use the first element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element, which may result in a different behavior.

DONE.
