  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is a different function than `Q.denodeify` and would cause a different execution path in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfcall` is a different function than `Q.denodeify` and would cause a different execution path in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a different function than `Q.denodeify` and would cause a different execution path in the code.

DONE.
