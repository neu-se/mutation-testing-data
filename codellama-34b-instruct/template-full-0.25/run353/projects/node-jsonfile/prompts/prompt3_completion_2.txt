  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.toString()` returns a string representation of the `file` object, whereas `file` by itself is a file object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.name` returns the name of the file, whereas `file` by itself is a file object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `file.path` returns the path of the file, whereas `file` by itself is a file object.

DONE.
