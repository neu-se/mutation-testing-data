  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the value to be set to the wrong property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value to be set is the same as the property name, causing an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value to be set is the same as the property value, causing the property to be set to itself.

DONE.
