  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E` is a mathematical constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm, and it has a value of approximately 2.718. In the original code, the number 2 is used as a power to calculate the tile number. Replacing it with `Math.E` would give a different result, potentially causing errors in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.MAX_VALUE
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.MAX_VALUE` is a constant that represents the maximum value that can be represented by a number in JavaScript. It has a value of approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308. In the original code, the number 2 is used as a power to calculate the tile number. Replacing it with `Number.MAX_VALUE` would give a different result, potentially causing errors in the calculation.
