  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a valid reference to the value of the promise, while `undefined` is not a valid reference and would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a valid reference to the value of the promise, while `null` is a valid reference but would result in a different value being passed to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"value"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `value` is a valid reference to the value of the promise, while `"value"` is a string literal and would result in a different value being passed to the `then` method.

DONE.
