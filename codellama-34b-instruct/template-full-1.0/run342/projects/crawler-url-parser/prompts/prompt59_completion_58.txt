  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return null, regardless of the value of the `currentUrlStr` and `baseUrlStr` parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the first character of the `currentUrlStr` parameter, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always remove the first character of the `baseUrlStr` parameter, regardless of its value.

DONE.
