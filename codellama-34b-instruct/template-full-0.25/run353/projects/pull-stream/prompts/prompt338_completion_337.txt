  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified by adding 1 to it, which would change the value that is being passed to the `prop` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified by subtracting 1 from it, which would change the value that is being passed to the `prop` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is being modified by multiplying it by 2, which would change the value that is being passed to the `prop` function.

DONE.
