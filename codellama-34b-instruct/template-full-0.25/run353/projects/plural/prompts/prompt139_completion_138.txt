  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only adds an 's' to the word if the word does not already end in 's'. However, this replacement would add an 's' to every word, regardless of whether it already ends in 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only removes the last letter of the word if it ends in 'y'. However, this replacement would remove the last letter of every word, regardless of whether it ends in 'y'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the last letter of the word with 'ies' if it ends in 'y'. However, this replacement would replace the last letter of every word with 'ies', regardless of whether it
