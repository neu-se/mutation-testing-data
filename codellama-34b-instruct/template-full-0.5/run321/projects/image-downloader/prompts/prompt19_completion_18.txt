  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative()` checks if the path is relative to the current working directory, while `!path.isAbsolute()` checks if the path is not absolute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isAbsolute()` checks if the path is absolute, while `!path.isAbsolute()` checks if the path is not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isRelative(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.isRelative()` checks if the path is relative to the current working directory, while `!path.isAbsolute()` checks if the path is not absolute.

DONE.
