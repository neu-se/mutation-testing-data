  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` would immediately reject the promise, whereas `thenResolve` would resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.thenReject(promise, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenReject` would immediately reject the promise, whereas `thenResolve` would resolve the promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.thenResolve(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` would immediately reject the promise resolved by `thenResolve`, whereas `thenResolve` would resolve the promise with the given value.

DONE.
