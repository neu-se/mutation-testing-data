  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, whereas `regardless` is a function that returns the result of `promise.inspect()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Test error")` would throw an error, whereas `regardless` would return the result of `promise.inspect()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.inspect().then(function (result) { return result + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of `promise.inspect()` plus 1, whereas `regardless` would return the result of `promise.inspect()` as is.

DONE.
