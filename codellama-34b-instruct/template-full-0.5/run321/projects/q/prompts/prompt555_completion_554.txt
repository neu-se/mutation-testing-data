  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on `errback` with the `this` context set to `null`, and the first argument set to the string `"throw"`. This would cause the `errback` function to be called with the `this` context set to `null` and the first argument set to the string `"throw"`, which would likely result in an error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on `errback` with the `this` context set to `null`, and the first argument set to the string `"next"`. This would cause the `errback` function to be called with the `this` context set to `null` and the first argument set to the string `"next"`, which would likely result in the `errback` function being called with the wrong arguments.
