  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment would pass `null` as the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment would pass `undefined` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Error: invalid data")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function, while the new code fragment would log a message to the console instead.

DONE.
