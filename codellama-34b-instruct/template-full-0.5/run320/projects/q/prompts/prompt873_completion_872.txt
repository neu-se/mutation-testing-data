  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q(callback)` returns a promise that is pending until `callback` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q(callback)` returns a promise that is pending until `callback` is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(function () {})` returns a promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q(callback)` returns a promise that is pending until `callback` is called.

DONE.
