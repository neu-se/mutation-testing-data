  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property of the `countries` object is falsy, rather than checking if the `country` variable is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property of the `country` object is falsy, rather than checking if the `country` variable is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `id` property of the `data.countries` object is falsy, rather than checking if the `country` variable is falsy.

DONE.
