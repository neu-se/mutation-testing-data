  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise object, and `undefined` is a primitive value. The `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the two values must be of the same type and have the same value. In this case, the types are different, so the expression would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that represents the absence of any object value. The `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the two values must be of the same type and have the same value. In this case, the types are different, so the expression would always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
