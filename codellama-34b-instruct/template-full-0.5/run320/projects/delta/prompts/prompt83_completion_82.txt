  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for deep equality, while `!==` checks for reference inequality. If `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` are different objects with the same properties, the `!==` operator would return `true`, even though `isEqual` would return `true` if the objects have the same properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(newOp.attributes).length !== Object.keys(lastOp.attributes).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys from an object, and `length` returns the number of elements in an array. If `newOp.attributes` and `lastOp.attributes` have a different number of properties, the `length` property would be different, even though `isEqual` would return `true` if the objects have the same properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
