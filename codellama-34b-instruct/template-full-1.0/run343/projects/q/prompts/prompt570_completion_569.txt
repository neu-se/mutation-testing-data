  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.when(result, errback)```
This would result in different behavior because the parameter order for Q.when is reversed
from the intended code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.when(result).then(callback, errback)```
This would result in different behavior because the parameters are now wrapped in a promise

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.when(result, callback, errback)```
This would result in different behavior because the Q.when function called with 3 arguments

DONE.
