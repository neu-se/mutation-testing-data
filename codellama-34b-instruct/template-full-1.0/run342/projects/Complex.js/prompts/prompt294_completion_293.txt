  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function expects a number as its input, but `0` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function expects a number as its input, but `null` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a number that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, while `b` is the variable that represents the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
