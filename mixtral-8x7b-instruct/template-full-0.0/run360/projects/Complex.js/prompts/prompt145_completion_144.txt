 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is always true, bypassing the condition and potentially causing incorrect behavior in the multiplication operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.isZero()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `isZero` method on the `this` object, which may not always return the expected value, causing the condition to fail or succeed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition is always false, bypassing the multiplication operation and potentially causing incorrect behavior in the final result.

DONE.
