  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `iter.hasNext()`, causing the loop to exit early.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would cause the `hasNext` method to be called, which would return a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method would return the next element in the iterator, without advancing the iterator.

DONE.
