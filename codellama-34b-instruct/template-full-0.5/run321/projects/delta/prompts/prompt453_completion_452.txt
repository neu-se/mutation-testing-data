  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with a length of 0, which would cause the iterator to always return the first element in the `ops` array, regardless of the current position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(this.offset);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with the current offset, which would cause the iterator to always return the same element in the `ops` array, regardless of the current position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.next(this.index);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method would be called with the current index, which would cause the iterator to always return the same element in the `ops` array, regardless of the current position.

DONE.
