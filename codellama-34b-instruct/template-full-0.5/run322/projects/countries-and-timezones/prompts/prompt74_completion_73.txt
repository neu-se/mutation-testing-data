  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the name property of the data object, while this new code fragment retrieves the name property of the data object and appends a '0' to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the name property of the data object, while this new code fragment retrieves the name property of the data object and converts it to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the name property of the data object, while this new code fragment retrieves the name property of the data.timezones object.

DONE.
