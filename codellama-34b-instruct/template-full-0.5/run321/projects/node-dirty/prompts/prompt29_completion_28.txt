  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is not a valid method for the `Map` class, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is not a valid method for the `Map` class, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is not a valid method for the `Map` class, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

DONE.
