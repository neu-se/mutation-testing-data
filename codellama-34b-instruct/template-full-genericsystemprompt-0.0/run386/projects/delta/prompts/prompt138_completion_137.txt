  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator is used instead of the `<=` operator, which would cause the loop to continue even if the `firstLeft` value is exceeded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of the `<=` operator, which would cause the loop to continue only if the `firstLeft` value is exactly equal to the peek length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of the `<=` operator, which would cause the loop
