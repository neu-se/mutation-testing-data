 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` returns an array of all own property names of an object, including non-enumerable properties, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own (not inherited) enumerable string-keyed properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of an object's own enumerable property values, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the object's own (not inherited) enumerable string-keyed properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of a given object's key-value pairs, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of the
