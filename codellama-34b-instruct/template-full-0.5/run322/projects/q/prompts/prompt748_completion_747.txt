  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved, which would cause the `onFulfilled` function to be skipped and the `onRejected` function to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `onProgress` function to be called instead of the `onFulfilled` or `onRejected` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be canceled instead of resolved or rejected, which would cause the `onCanceled` function to be called instead of the `onFulfilled`, `onRejected`, or `onProgress` functions.

DONE.
