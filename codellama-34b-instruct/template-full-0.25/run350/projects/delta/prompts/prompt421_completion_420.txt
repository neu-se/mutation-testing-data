  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to calculate the offset, but replacing it with `0` would always return `0`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to calculate the offset, but replacing it with `-length` would always return a negative value, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to calculate the offset, but replacing it with `length + 1` would always return a value that is one greater than the original offset, regardless of the input.

DONE.
