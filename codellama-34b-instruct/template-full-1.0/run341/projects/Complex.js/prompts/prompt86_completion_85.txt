  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the next token as a number, even if it's not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only treat the next token as a number if it's an 'i' or 'I', even if it's not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === '+' || tokens[i + 1] === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only treat the next token as a number if it's a plus or minus sign, even if it's not a number.

DONE.
