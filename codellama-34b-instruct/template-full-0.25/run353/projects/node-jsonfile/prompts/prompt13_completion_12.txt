  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the reviver function to `JSON.parse()`, which would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the parsed object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the reviver function to `JSON.parse()`, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the parsed object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as the reviver function to `JSON.parse()`, which would cause the function to return an empty object instead of the parsed object.

DONE.
