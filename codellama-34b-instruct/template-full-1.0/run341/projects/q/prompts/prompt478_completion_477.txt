  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because when the code is executed, it will return 2 as the index of the `promise` in `unhandledRejections`, instead of returning -1, which means that the `promise` is not in the array. This would lead to incorrect behavior, for example, the `unhandledRejection` event would not be emitted for the `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because when the code is executed, it will return 0 as the index of the `promise` in `unhandledRejections`, even if the `promise` is not in the array. This would lead to incorrect behavior, for example, the `rejectionHandled` event would be emitted for a `promise` that was never rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because
