  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` returns the next operation and advances the iterator. Using `otherIter.peek` would result in an infinite loop, as the iterator would always be pointing to the same operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` returns a boolean indicating whether there are more operations in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` returns the next operation. Using `otherIter.hasNext` would result in an infinite loop, as the iterator would always be pointing to the same operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` returns the next operation from the current iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` returns the next operation from
