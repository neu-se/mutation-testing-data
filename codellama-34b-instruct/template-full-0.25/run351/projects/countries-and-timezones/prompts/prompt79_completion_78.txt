  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `getTimezone` function calls itself recursively without any base case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { allTimezones: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all timezones, including deprecated ones, instead of only returning non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
