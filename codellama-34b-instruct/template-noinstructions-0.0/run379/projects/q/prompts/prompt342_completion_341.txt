  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is not called with the correct `value` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function is not called with the correct `exception` argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is not called with the correct `exception` argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an incorrect reason.

DONE.
