  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err){
console.log(err);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `deferred.reject` method is used to reject the promise with the err parameter resulting in the code inside the reject function running with the error as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(err){
return err;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because this would return the error object instead of sending it to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Error:", err)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of just logging the error object, it prints a custom message with the error.

DONE.
