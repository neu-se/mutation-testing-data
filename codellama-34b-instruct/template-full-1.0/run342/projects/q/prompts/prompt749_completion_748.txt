  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be incremented by 1, which may not be the intended behavior for the code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be multiplied by 2, which may not be the intended behavior for the code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the result would be returned, which may not be the intended behavior for the code fragment.

DONE.
