  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This means that the `for...of` loop would iterate over the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values.

DONE.
