 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment divides by `d`, but the modified code fragment would always result in 0 for the second component of the Complex number, regardless of the value of `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not involve `b` in the denominator, but the modified code fragment would introduce a division by `b`, which could lead to unexpected results if `b` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not involve any randomness, but the modified code fragment would introduce a random value between 0 and 1, which could lead to unpredictable results.

DONE.
