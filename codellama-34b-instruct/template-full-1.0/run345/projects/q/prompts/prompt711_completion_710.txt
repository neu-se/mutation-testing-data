  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` is a method of the `Object` prototype, while `get` is a method of the `Q` object, which is not a standard JavaScript method. Using `get` instead of `keys` would likely cause the code to fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"has"
```
This would result in different behavior because `has` is a method of the `Object` prototype, while `keys` is a method of the `Q` object. Using `has` instead of `keys` would likely cause the code to fail with a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"prototype"
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype` is a property of the `Object` constructor, while `keys` is a method of the `Q` object. Using `prototype` instead of `keys` would likely cause the code to fail with a `
