  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the current operation, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same attributes as the last operation, instead of modifying the current operation's attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the attributes of the current operation to null, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to false and the `insert` method to return early.

DONE.
