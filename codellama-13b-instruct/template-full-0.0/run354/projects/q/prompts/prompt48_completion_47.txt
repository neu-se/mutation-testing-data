  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit()` function would be called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `domain.exit` would be called later when the `runSingle` function is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit(true)` function would be called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `domain.exit` would be called later when the `runSingle` function is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain.exit(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `domain.exit(false)` function would be called immediately, whereas the original code fragment `domain.exit` would be called later when the `runSingle` function is executed.

DONE.
