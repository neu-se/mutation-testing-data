  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to `undefined`, whereas `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments passed to the `makeNodeResolver` method. Using `void 0` instead of `nodeArgs` would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to receive `undefined` as its argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `nodeArgs` is an array of arguments passed to the `makeNodeResolver` method. Using `[]` instead of `nodeArgs` would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to receive an empty array as its argument, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a JavaScript value that represents the absence of
