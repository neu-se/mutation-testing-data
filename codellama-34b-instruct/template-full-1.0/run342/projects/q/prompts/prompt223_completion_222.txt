  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects an object as its first argument, and will throw an error if it receives `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function expects an object as its first argument, and will return a rejected promise if it receives a function as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_assign
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_assign` function is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object, and will return a new object with the combined properties of all the source objects.

DONE.
