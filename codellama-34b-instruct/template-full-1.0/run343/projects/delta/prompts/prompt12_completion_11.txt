  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logic is flipped, the inverse of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != undefined && b[key] == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a non-strict comparison operation instead of a strict equality check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the opposite condition, where `a[key]` is undefined and `b[key]` is not.

DONE.
