  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
T
```
This would result in different behavior because T does not exist as a function or method in the Q library, whereas Q is a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because promise.then() is a method that is called on an existing promise to add a callback to be executed when the promise is resolved, whereas Q is a function that returns a new promise and expects a callback to be passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because Promise.resolve() is a method that creates a new promise that is resolved with a given value, whereas Q is a function that returns a new promise and does not accept any arguments.

DONE.
