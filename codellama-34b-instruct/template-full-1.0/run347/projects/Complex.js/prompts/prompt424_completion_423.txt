  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property checks if the value is infinite or not, while `this['re'] === Infinity` checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to the value of Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` property checks if the complex number is infinite or not, while `this['im'] !== 0` checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite'] && this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` negates the result of `isInfinite` and then checks if the real part of the complex number is equal to the value of Infinity.

DONE.
