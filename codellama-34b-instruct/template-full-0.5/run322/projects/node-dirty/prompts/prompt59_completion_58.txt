  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called with a truthy argument, which would cause the file streams to be closed immediately, rather than waiting for the queue to be drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_queue` object would be cleared, causing all pending writes to be discarded, rather than being flushed to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_writeStream` object would be uncorked, allowing writes to be processed immediately, rather than being buffered.

DONE.
