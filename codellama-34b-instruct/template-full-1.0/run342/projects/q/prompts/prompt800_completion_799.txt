  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.foo
```
This would result in a ReferenceError because the `foo` property does not exist on the function object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then = function() {}
```
This would result in a SyntaxError because the `then` property is a reserved word and cannot be used as a property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then() = function() {}
```
This would result in a SyntaxError because the `then()` method is a function expression and cannot be reassigned to a function definition.

DONE.
