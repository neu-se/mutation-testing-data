  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(φ1)` is the cosine of the latitude, which is not the same as the angular distance `δ` in radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin(φ1)` is the sine of the latitude, which is not the same as the angular distance `δ` in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, which is not the same as the angular distance `δ` in radians.

DONE.
