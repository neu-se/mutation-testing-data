  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is used to concatenate two arrays, whereas the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate two strings. This would cause the `next` method to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].push
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is used to add an element to the end of an array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate two strings. This would cause the `next` method to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is used to extract a section of an array, whereas the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to concatenate two strings.
