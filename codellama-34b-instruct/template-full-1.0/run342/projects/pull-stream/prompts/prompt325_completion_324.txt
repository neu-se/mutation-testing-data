  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` returns `true` if `end` is falsy, whereas `end` returns `end` itself. If `end` is not falsy, the original code fragment would return `end`, which would cause the function to return early with the current value of `end`. However, if we replace `end` with `!end`, the function would always return `true`, which could potentially cause the stream to remain open indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end === true` checks if `end` is strictly equal to `true`, whereas `end` checks if `end` is truthy. If `end` is not strictly equal to `true`, the original code fragment would return `end`, which would cause the function to return early with the current value of `end`. However, if we replace `end` with `end === true`, the function would always return `end === true
