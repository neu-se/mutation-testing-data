  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` is a method that returns the primitive value of an object, whereas `Object.prototype.toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a property with the given name, whereas `Object.prototype.toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toLocaleString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object in a locale-specific manner, whereas `Object.prototype.toString` is a method that returns a string representation of an object.

DONE.
