  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first word of the stack line, which may not include the file name and line number information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the last word of the stack line, which may not include the file name and line number information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the second word of the stack line, which may not include the file name and line number information.

DONE.
