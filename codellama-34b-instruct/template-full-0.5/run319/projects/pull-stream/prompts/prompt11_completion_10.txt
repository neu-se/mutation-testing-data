  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1 instead of 0, which could cause the first element of the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array instead of the first, which could cause the last element of the array to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a random index of the array instead of the first, which could cause any element of the array to be skipped.

DONE.
