 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error('Something went wrong') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of doing nothing or executing a given callback without arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because it only executes the callback if it is truthy, instead of always executing it or doing nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the callback to the next tick of the event loop, which might cause issues if the order of execution is important.

DONE.
