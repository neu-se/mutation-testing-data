 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately terminate the reading process without checking the test function, even if the `end` event has not been emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(false)
