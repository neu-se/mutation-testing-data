 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fulfill` is a reference to a function that doesn't exist in the provided code. Replacing it with `Promise.resolve()` would change the behavior of the code by resolving the promise immediately instead of waiting for the `fulfill` function to be defined and called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fulfill` is a reference to a function that doesn't exist in the provided code. Replacing it with `new Error()` would change the behavior of the code by throwing an error instead of resolving the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `fulfill` is a reference to a function that doesn't exist in the provided
