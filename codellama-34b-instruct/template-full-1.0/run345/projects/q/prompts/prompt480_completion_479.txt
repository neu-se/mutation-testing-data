  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.shift` would remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, while `unhandledReasons.splice` would remove the element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ReportedUnhandledRejections.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `ReportedUnhandledRejections` is not defined anywhere in the code, and `unhandledRejections` is the correct variable name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.pop` would remove the last element of the `unhandledReasons` array, while `unhandledReasons.splice` would remove the element at the specified index.

DONE.
