 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.props.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true if there are no properties in the regex.props array, instead of checking if the context exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx['undefined']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the 'undefined' property exists in the context object, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(ctx).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the context object is empty, instead of checking if the context exists.

DONE.
