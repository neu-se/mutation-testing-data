  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the key as an argument to the `delete` method, while the modified code fragment passes both the key and value as arguments. This could potentially cause the `delete` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
