  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded, rather than a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded and settled, as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the return value of the generator, rather than a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded and settled, as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().all()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise among those yielded and settled, rather than a promise for the return value of the generator or the first rejected promise
