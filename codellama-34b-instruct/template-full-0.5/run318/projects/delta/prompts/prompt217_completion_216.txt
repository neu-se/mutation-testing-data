  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops` is an array of operations, while `other.ops.slice()` returns a new array of operations starting from the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops.length` returns the number of operations in the array, while `other.ops.slice()` returns a new array of operations starting from the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.push({ insert: 'hello' })
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops.push({ insert: 'hello' })` adds a new operation to the array, while `other.ops.slice()` returns a new array of operations starting from the specified index.

DONE.
