 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would not properly split the chunk into rows, causing potential data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash would escape the 'n' character, changing the line break delimiter. This would cause the code to fail to parse rows correctly, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<PLACEHOLDER>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not replace the placeholder with the actual line break delimiter, causing the code to fail to parse rows correctly, leading to potential data loss or corruption.

DONE.
