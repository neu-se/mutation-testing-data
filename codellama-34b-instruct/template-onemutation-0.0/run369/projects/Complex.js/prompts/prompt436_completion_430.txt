  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `places || 0` uses the logical OR operator to return `0` if `places` is falsy, while the new code fragment `places && 0` uses the logical AND operator to return `0` if `places` is falsy. In the context of the `floor` method, this would cause the method to always return `0` if `places` is falsy, regardless of the value of `this['im']`.

DONE.
