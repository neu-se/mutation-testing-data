  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset += length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `offset` variable by the `length` of the current operation, while this replacement increments it by the `length` of the current operation plus the `length` of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset -= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `offset` variable by the `length` of the current operation, while this replacement decrements it by the `length` of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset = length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `offset` variable by the `length` of the current operation, while this replacement sets it to the `length` of the current operation.

DONE.
