  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolvedPromise` is an object that has a `promiseDispatch` method, but in this replacement, `null` does not have that method, so the call to `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolvedPromise` is an object that has a `promiseDispatch` method, but in this replacement, `undefined` does not have that method, so the call to `resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch` would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolvedPromise` is an object that has a `promiseDispatch` method, but in this replacement, `promise` is not an object, so the call
