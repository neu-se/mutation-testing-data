  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with a single element, `[1]`, instead of an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with a single element, `null`, instead of an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise for an array with a single element, `undefined`, instead of an empty array.

DONE.
