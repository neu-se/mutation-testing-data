  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the given string, whereas `path.match` returns all occurrences in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.includes` checks if the given string is present in the path, whereas `path.match` returns all matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.replace` replaces all occurrences of the given string, whereas `path.match` returns all matches.

Note: These options are just examples and may not be the only possible answers. The goal is to demonstrate different types of mutations that can be applied to the code.

DONE.
