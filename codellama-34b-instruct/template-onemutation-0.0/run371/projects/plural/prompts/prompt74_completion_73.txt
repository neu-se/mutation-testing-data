  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('die', 'dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was adding a rule for the word "die" to be pluralized as "dice", but the new code fragment is adding a rule for the word "die" to be pluralized as "dies".

DONE.
