  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array has a negative length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the array has a length of 1.

DONE.
