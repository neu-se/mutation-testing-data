  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` would return a portion of the string, rather than splitting it into an array of substrings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase` would return the string in uppercase, rather than splitting it into an array of substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace(' ', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` would remove all spaces from the string, rather than splitting it into an array of substrings.

DONE.
