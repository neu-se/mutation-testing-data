  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` returns a new array containing a subset of the `arguments` array, whereas `arguments` alone refers to the original array of function arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a value that is always evaluated as `undefined`, whereas `arguments` is an object that represents the list of arguments passed to a function when it is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, whereas `arguments` is an object that represents the list of arguments passed to a function when it is invoked.

DONE.
