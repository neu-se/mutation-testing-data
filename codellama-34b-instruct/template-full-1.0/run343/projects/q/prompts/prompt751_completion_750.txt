  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with an undefined reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any_(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `any_` is not a function and would cause a ReferenceError.

DONE.
