  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except the first one, whereas the original code fragment returns a new array containing all elements of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except the last one, whereas the original code fragment returns a new array containing all elements of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except the first and last ones, whereas the original code fragment returns a new array containing all elements of the original array.

DONE.
