  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error message, rather than resolving with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(new Error("I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error, rather than resolving with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the specified error, rather than resolving with a value.

DONE.
