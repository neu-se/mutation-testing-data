  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This change will cause the `query` method to use the `path` property of the `ctx` object instead of the `ctx` object itself. This could potentially cause the method to return a different result than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This change will cause the `query` method to use the `verb` property of the `ctx` object instead of the `ctx` object itself. This could potentially cause the method to return a different result than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path.split('/')
```
This change will cause the `query` method to use the `path` property of the `ctx` object, but split it into an array of substrings using the `/` character as a delimiter. This could potentially cause the method to return a different result than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
