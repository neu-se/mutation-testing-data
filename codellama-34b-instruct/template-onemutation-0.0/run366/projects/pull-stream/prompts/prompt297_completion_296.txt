  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` function as an argument, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` simply calls the `cb` function with `null` and `data` as arguments, without calling the `terminate` function.
