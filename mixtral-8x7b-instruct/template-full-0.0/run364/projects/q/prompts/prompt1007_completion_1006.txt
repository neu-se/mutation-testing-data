 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the actual implementation of `array_slice`, but using it directly would bypass any potential modifications or overrides to `array_slice`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and attempting to call it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of the enumerable properties of an object, not an array-like object that can be sliced with `array_slice`. This would result in a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
