  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the `inspect` method to the `object` parameter, which would cause the method to be called on the `object` instead of the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object` parameter, which would cause the method to be called on the `object` instead of the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `inspect` method to the `object` parameter, which would cause the method to be called on the `object` instead of the `Q` object.

DONE.
