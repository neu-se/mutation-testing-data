  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` argument passed to the `reducer` function, while `null` is a constant value that does not refer to any specific data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` argument passed to the `reducer` function, while `undefined` is a value that indicates the absence of a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the `data` argument passed to the `reducer` function, while `0` is a constant value that does not refer to any specific data.

DONE.
