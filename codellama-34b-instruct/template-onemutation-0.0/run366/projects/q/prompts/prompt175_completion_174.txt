  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `join` is a method that creates a string by concatenating all the elements of an array. In the context of the code, `desiredLines` is an array of strings, and `join` is used to concatenate these strings into a single string. If `push` is used instead of `join`, it would add each string to the end of the `desiredLines` array, rather than concatenating them into a single string.
