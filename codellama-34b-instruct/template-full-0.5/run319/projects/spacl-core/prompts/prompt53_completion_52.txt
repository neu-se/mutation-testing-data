  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+?)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the non-greedy modifier `?` would cause the regex to match the shortest possible string, rather than the longest possible string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+*)'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` modifier would cause the regex to match zero or more occurrences of the previous character, rather than one or more occurrences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+{1,})'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{1,}` modifier would cause the regex to match one or more occurrences of the previous character, rather than zero or more occurrences.

DONE.
