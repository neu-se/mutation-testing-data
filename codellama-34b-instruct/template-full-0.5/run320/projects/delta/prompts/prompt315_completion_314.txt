  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the operation, which could cause errors in the code that uses this value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is one less than the actual length of the operation, which could cause errors in the code that uses this value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a value that is twice the actual length of the operation, which could cause errors in the code that uses this value.

DONE.
