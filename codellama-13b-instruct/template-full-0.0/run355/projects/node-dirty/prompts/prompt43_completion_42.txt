  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `set` method is a callback function that is called when the data is persisted. In the original code, the callback function is only called when the data is persisted to the file system. However, in the modified code, the callback function is also called when the data is persisted to the in-memory cache. This could cause issues if the callback function has side effects that are not intended to be executed when the data is only persisted to the cache.
