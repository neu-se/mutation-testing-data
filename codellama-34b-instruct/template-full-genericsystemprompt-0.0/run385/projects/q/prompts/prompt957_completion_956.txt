  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would be called with a fixed delay of 1000 milliseconds, regardless of the actual delay passed to the `delay` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(timeout + 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would be called with a delay that is 1000 milliseconds longer than the actual delay passed to the `delay` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(timeout * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.delay` function would be called with a delay that is twice the actual delay passed to the `delay` function.

DONE.
