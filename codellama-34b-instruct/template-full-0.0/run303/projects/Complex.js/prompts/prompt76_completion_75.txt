  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition is initially false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

DONE.
