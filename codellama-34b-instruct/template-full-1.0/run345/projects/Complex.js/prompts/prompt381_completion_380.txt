  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator would return the positive value of the operand, which is the same as the operand in this case, whereas the original code would return the hyperbolic cosine of the operand.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(Math.cosh(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs()` function returns the absolute value of the operand, which would change the sign of the result in this case, whereas the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.cosh(a) ** 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root function would return a different result than the hyperbolic cosine function, even though both functions take the cosine of the same operand.

DONE.
