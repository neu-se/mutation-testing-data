  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(abort)` would call the `read` function with `abort` as its argument, while the original code fragment `read` would call the `read` function without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(null)` would call the `read` function with `null` as its argument, while the original code fragment `read` would call the `read` function without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(true)` would call the `read` function with `true` as its argument, while the original code fragment `read` would call the `read` function without any arguments.

DONE.
