  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error = Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `throw` would throw an error and terminate the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error = Q.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a fulfilled promise with the error value, while `throw` would throw an error and terminate the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error = new Error(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the error message, while `throw` would throw the error object directly.

DONE.
