  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `dest` variable to lowercase, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr()` method would return a substring of the `dest` variable starting from the second character, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `dest` variable into an array of substrings using the dot (`.`) character as a separator, and then return the first element of the array, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
