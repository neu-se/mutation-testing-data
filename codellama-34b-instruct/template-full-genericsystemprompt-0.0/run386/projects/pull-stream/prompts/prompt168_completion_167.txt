  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment `onAbort` simply refers to the function without executing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with a `this` value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment `onAbort` would execute the function with a `this` value of the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.apply(null)` would execute the `onAbort` function with a `this` value of `null`, whereas the original code fragment `onAbort` would execute the function with a `this` value of the global object
