  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method of the `Delta` class that adds a new operation to the delta, whereas `push` is a method of the `Array` class that adds an element to the end of an array. In this particular case, using `insert` instead of `push` would cause the code to misbehave because it would insert a new operation into the delta without considering its position in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method of the `Array` class that removes an element from the end of an array, whereas `push` is a method of the same class that adds an element to the end of the array. In this particular case, using `pop` instead of `push` would cause the code to misbehave because it would remove an operation from the delta without considering its position in the delta.
