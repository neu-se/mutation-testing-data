  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_rejected` function is called instead of the `_fulfilled` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value).then(_rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function is called first, and then the `_rejected` function is called on the result of the `_fulfilled` function. This could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

DONE.
