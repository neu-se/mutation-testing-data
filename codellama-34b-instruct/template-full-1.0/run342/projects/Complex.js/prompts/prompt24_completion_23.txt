  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the calculation of the hypotenuse from the actual value to always 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the hypotenuse from 1 instead of the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the square of `b` instead of the actual value.

DONE.
