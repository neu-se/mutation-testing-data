  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while the new code fragment checks if `err` is `false`. This change would cause the function to return a different value in the case where `err` is `false`, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
