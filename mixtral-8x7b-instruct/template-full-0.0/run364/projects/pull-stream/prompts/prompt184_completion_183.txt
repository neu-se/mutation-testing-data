 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would always receive `false` instead of the actual value from the array. This could cause issues if the consumer of this function expects the callback's second argument to be the value from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would receive the current index `i` instead of the actual value from the array. This could cause issues if the consumer of this function expects the callback's second argument to be the value from the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i] = 'mutated value'; cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the current element in the array would be replaced with a "mutated value" before being returned. This could cause issues if the consumer of this function expects the array to remain unchanged.

DONE.
