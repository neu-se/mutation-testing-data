  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `this.rules` refers to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter(rule => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` creates a new array with only the elements that match the provided predicate, whereas `this.rules` refers to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the original array with the provided value, whereas `this.rules` refers to the original array.

DONE.
