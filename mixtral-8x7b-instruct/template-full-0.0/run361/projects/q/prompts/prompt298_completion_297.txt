 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is the constructor function, while `Promise` is the prototype object. Using `Promise` instead of `Q` would cause the `join` method to fail, as it expects a constructor function to call `Q` with an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method expects a promise as the first argument. Replacing the `Q` with `null` would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call the `join` method on a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method expects a promise as the first argument. Replacing the `Q` with an empty function would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call the `join` method on a non-function value.
