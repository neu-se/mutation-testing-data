  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `push` method to always set the `attributes` property of the new op to `null`, regardless of whether it was originally set to a non-null value. This would cause the `push` method to behave differently than the original code, which would only set the `attributes` property to `null` if it was originally set to a non-null value.
