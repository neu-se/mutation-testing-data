  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `callback.apply` is a function that applies the callback function to the given arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `callback.apply` is a function that applies the callback function to the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is a function that returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, whereas `callback.apply` is a function that applies the callback function to the given arguments.

DONE.
