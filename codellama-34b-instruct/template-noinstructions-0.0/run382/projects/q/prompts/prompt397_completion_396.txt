  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will reject the promise with the provided reason, whereas `thenResolve` will resolve the promise with the provided value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will return a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, whereas `thenResolve` will resolve the promise with the provided value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function will return the provided value, whereas `thenResolve` will resolve the promise with the provided value.

DONE.
