  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This code fragment is a function call to `abortCb`, which is a function that takes three arguments: `cb`, `abort`, and `onAbort`. The function call is made with the same arguments as the original code fragment, but the order of the arguments is different. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the function `abortCb` is not designed to handle the different order of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort)
```
This code fragment is similar to the previous one, but the order of the arguments is different. This change may also cause the test suite to fail if the function `abortCb` is not designed to handle the different order of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, null)
```
