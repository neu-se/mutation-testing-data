  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `array_slice(arguments)`, which returns a new array containing all elements from the `arguments` object, while the new code fragment is using `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which returns a new array containing all elements from the `arguments` object except for the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `array_slice(arguments)`, which returns a new array containing all elements from the `arguments` object, while the new code fragment is using `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, which returns a new array containing all elements from the `arguments` object except for the first two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
