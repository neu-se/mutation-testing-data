  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString()` would return a string representation of the buffer, while `content.toString` would return a reference to the `toString` method of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString('utf16')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString('utf16')` would return a string representation of the buffer encoded as UTF-16, while `content.toString` would return a reference to the `toString` method of the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString(16)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.toString(16)` would return a string representation of the buffer encoded as hexadecimal, while `content.toString` would return a reference to the `toString` method of the buffer.

DONE.
