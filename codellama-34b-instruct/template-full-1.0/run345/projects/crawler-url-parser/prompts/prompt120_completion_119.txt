  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(currentUrl.url, baseUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function parse is being called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL is being passed as null instead of a valid URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the current URL is being passed as null instead of a valid URL.

DONE.
