  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive a `null` value as the `this` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive an `undefined` value as the `this` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive a `0` value as the `this` argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
