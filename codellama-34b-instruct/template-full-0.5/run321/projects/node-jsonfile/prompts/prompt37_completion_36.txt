  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property of the `options` object is not the same as the `options` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property of the `options` object is not the same as the string `'utf8'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding || 'utf8'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property of the `options` object is not the same as the result of the `||` operator.

DONE.
