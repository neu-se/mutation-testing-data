  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would still consider it an object and execute the code inside the `if` block, while this replacement would not execute the code inside the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this replacement checks if `b` is not the string 'object'. If `b` is not the string 'object', the original code would still consider it an object and execute the code inside the `if` block, while this replacement would not execute the code inside the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an
