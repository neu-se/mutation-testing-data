  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `options` object as an argument to `getCountriesForTimezone()`, instead of the entire object. This could potentially cause errors if the function relies on other properties of the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as an argument to `getCountriesForTimezone()`, instead of the `options` object. This could potentially cause errors if the function depends on the `options` object being non-null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object as an argument to `getCountriesForTimezone()`, instead of the `options` object. This could potentially cause errors if the function depends on specific properties of the `options` object.

DONE.
