  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(line, {}, i) === false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would never be called with an empty `AttributeMap`, which may cause the function to behave differently when this case is encountered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(line, <PLACEHOLDER>, i) === false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which may cause the function to behave differently when this case is encountered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (predicate(line, new AttributeMap(), i) === false) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `predicate` function would be called with a different set of arguments, which may cause the function to behave differently when this case is encountered.

DONE.
