 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be always resolved instead of being rejected, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method expects a function as an argument, and an empty function would not propagate any errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method expects a function as an argument, and `null` would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
