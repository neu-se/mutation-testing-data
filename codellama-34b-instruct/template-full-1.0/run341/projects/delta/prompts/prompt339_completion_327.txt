  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is used as an argument in the slice() method, so the replaced fragment would be equivalent to calling slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + 2), which would return an empty slice.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is used as an argument in the slice() method, so the replaced fragment would be equivalent to calling slice(baseIndex - 1, baseIndex + 1), which would return a slice that includes the baseIndex - 1st and baseIndex + 1st elements of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - baseIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the PLACEHOLDER is used as an argument in the slice() method, so the replaced fragment would be equivalent to calling slice(length - baseIndex, length - baseIndex +
