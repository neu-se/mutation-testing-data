  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would not be exported as a module, and the `Complex` object would not have an `__esModule` property set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would be exported as a module, and the `Complex` object would have an `__esModule` property set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule": undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor would not be exported as a module, and the `Complex` object would not have an `__esModule` property set to `true`.

DONE.
