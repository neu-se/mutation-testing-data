  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, and replacing it with a call to the function would cause the error handling code to be executed, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, and replacing it with a call to the function with a null context would cause the error handling code to be executed, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, and replacing it with a call to the function with the `Q` object as the context would cause the error handling code to be executed, which is not
