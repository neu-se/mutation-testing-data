  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `currentUrlStr` variable, while this code fragment checks for its value to be `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `currentUrlStr` variable, while this code fragment checks for its value to be `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of the `currentUrlStr` variable, while this code fragment checks for its value to be an empty string.

DONE.
