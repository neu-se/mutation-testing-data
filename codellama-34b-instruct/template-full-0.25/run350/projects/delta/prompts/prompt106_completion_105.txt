  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (index % 2 === 0) {
    return predicate(op, index);
  } else {
    return !predicate(op, index);
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the index of the current element, and the result would be negated for every other element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (index === 0) {
    return predicate(op, index);
  } else {
    return !predicate(op, index - 1);
  }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the index of the current element, and the result would be negated for every other element except the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op, index) => {
  if (index === this.
