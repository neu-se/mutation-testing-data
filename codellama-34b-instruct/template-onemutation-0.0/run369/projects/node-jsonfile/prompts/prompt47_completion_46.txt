  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, while `null` is a null value. The `fs.writeFileSync` method would throw an error if the `file` argument is null, while it would not throw an error if the `file` argument is a string.

DONE.
