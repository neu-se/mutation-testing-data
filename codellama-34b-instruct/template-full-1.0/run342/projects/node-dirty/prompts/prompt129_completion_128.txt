  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `cork` method, and attempting to pass it will result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(){};
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork` is a method that takes a single argument, but this code fragment is passing an empty function which would not be valid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number, which would be passed as an argument to the `cork` method, potentially causing it to execute with an unexpected value.

DONE.
