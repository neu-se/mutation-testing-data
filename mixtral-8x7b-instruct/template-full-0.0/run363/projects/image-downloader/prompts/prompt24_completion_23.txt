 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the current working directory instead of the module's directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the destination path relative to the current file instead of the module's directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a slash to the destination path, which might not be desired and could cause issues when joining other paths.

DONE.
