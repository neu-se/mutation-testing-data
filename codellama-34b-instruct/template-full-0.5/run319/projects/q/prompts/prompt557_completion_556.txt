  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object, rather than accessing the `verb` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object with the `arg` argument, rather than accessing the `verb` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `verb` method on the `generator` object with the `args` argument, rather than accessing the `verb` property.

DONE.
