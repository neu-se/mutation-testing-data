 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.then(undefined, undefined, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would always have three arguments, even if they are `undefined`. The original code only passes the `progressed` function as the third argument when the `progress` method is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.catch(progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used instead of `then` with the `progressed` function as an argument. This would change the behavior of the `progress` method, causing it to catch any rejections instead of just handling progress notifications.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.finally(progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used instead of `then` with the `progressed` function as an argument. This would cause the `progressed` function to be
