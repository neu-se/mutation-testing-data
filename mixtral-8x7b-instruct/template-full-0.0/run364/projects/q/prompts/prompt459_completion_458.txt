 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from checking if the promise exists in the array to checking the length of the array, which would always be truthy and not provide the desired unhandled rejection tracking.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections, [promise]
