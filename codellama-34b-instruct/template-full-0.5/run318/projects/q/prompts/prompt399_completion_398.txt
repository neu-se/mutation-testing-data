  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, function (value) {
    return callback.fcall(value).thenResolve(value);

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function is not called with the correct arguments. The first argument should be a promise, but `promise` is not defined in the current scope. Additionally, the callback function is not defined correctly, it should be `function (value) { return value; }`.
