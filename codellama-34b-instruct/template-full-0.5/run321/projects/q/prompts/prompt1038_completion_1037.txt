  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This would cause the `put` method to always return a rejected promise, which would likely cause the `get` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` returns a resolved promise with a value of `null`, whereas `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This would cause the `put` method to always return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, which would likely cause the `get` method to return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject("error")` returns a rejected promise with a value of `"error"`, whereas
