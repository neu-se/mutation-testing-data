  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString` method is called on the `value` object, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `toString` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `valueOf` method is called on the `value` object, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `valueOf` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toJSON` method is called on the `value` object, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the `toJSON` method is not implemented correctly.

DONE.
