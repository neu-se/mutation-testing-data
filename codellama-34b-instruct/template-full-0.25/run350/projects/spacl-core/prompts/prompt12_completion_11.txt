  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would return the index of the first match, rather than a boolean indicating whether there was a match or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `match`, and it would replace the first match with a new string, rather than returning a boolean indicating whether there was a match or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a different method than `match`, and it would split the string into an array of substrings, rather than returning a boolean indicating whether there was a match or not.

DONE.
