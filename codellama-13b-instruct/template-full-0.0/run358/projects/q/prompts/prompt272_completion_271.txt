  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the function has side effects or if it is called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.call(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the function has side effects or if it is called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListener.bind(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently if the function has side effects or if it is called with different arguments
