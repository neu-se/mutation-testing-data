  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and adding the string 'foo' to it would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `dest` is a string, and calling the `split()` method on it with an empty string as the argument would result in an array of characters, which is different from the original string.

DONE.
