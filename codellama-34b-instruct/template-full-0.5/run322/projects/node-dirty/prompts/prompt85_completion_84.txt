  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the buffer into an array of strings using whitespace as the separator. In contrast, the new code splits the buffer into an array of strings using newline characters as the separator, which would result in different behavior if the buffer contains non-whitespace characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method with no arguments, which splits the buffer into an array of strings using whitespace as the separator. In contrast, the new code splits the buffer into an array of strings using empty strings as the separator, which would result in different behavior if the buffer contains non-whitespace characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split`
