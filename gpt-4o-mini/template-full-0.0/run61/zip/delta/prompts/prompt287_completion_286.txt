Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly process lines when the index is positive, potentially skipping valid lines that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only process the first line and ignore all subsequent lines, which changes the intended iteration over all lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip processing the first line (when index is 0) and process all other lines, which alters the expected behavior of the function.

DONE.
