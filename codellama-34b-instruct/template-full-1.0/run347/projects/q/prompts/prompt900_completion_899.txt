  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called on the `deferred` object, but `undefined` is not an object and has no such method. This would cause an error to be thrown when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called on the `deferred` object, but `null` is not an object and has no such method. This would cause an error to be thrown when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){console.log("hello");}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called on the `deferred` object, but the replaced code does not call the `makeNodeResolver` method and instead calls a different function that logs a message to the console.
