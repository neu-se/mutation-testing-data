Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.slug || '').toString(), {transform: config.filename_case}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `data.title` as a fallback when `data.slug` is falsy, potentially leading to an empty string being used as the slug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.title || data.slug).toString(), {transform: config.filename_case}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prioritize `data.title` over `data.slug`, which could lead to unexpected slug generation if `data.title` is not intended to be used as a slug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(data.slug && data.title).toString(), {transform: config.filename_case}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only use the `data.title` if `data.slug` is truthy, potentially leading to `undefined` being used as the slug if `data.slug` is falsy.

DONE.
