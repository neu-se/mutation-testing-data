  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Error message"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the promise, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject(reason); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the promise, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is rejected with the reason that was passed to the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.fulfill(value); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the promise, while this new code fragment returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value that was passed to the `fulfill` function.

DONE.
