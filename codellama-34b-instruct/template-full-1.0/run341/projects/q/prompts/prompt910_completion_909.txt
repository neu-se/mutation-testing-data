  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is now incremented by 2, instead of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is now decremented by 1, instead of incremented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array and does not have a length, so `array_slice` would return an empty array instead of an array containing the provided arguments.

DONE.
