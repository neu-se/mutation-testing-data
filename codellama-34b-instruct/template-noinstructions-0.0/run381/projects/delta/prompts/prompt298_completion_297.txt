  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the wrong arguments. The `predicate` function expects three arguments: `line`, `attributes`, and `index`. However, the code fragment above would call it with `line`, `attributes`, and `i`, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the wrong arguments. The `predicate` function expects three arguments: `line`, `attributes`, and `index`. However, the code fragment above would call it with `line`, `attributes`, and `i + 1`, which would cause the function to behave differently.
