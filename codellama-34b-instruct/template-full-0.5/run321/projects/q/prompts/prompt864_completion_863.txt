  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to invoke it with the `delay` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to invoke it with the `delay` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value and would cause the `delay` method to return a rejected promise with the error "Timed out after 0 ms".

DONE.
