  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines.length - i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would terminate prematurely as the value of `i` would become negative, causing the condition to become false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute as the condition would always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only execute once as the value of `i` would be set to the value of `lines.length` and the condition would become false.

DONE.
