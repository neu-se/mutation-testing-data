  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.trim().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the `buffer` string, which could potentially change the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the length of the `buffer` string, regardless of whether the string has any whitespace characters at the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.indexOf('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first newline character in the `buffer` string, which could potentially be different from the length of the string if there are any trailing whitespace characters.

DONE.
