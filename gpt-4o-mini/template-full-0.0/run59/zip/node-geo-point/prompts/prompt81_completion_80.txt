Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude instead of the longitude, which would lead to incorrect calculations for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 90 degrees to the longitude, which would incorrectly shift the destination point eastward by 90 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 180 degrees from the longitude, which could lead to an invalid longitude value and potentially cause errors in the calculations.

DONE.
