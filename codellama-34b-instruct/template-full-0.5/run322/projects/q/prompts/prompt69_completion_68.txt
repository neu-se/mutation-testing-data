  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a message through the wrong port, potentially causing issues with communication between the different parts of the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a message with a payload of 0, which could cause issues if the receiving end of the message expects a different type of payload.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would send a message with a payload of "foo", which could cause issues if the receiving end of the message expects a different type of payload.

DONE.
