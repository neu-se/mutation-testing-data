  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object" && process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is missing, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false` even if `process` is an object and has an `emit` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if `process.emit` is a string, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false` even if `process` is an object and has an `emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process === "object" && process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used to check if `process.emit` is not a function, which would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true` even if `process`
