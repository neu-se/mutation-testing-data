  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that closes the stream immediately, whereas `end` is a method that waits for any pending writes to complete before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `write` is a method that writes data to the stream, whereas `end` is a method that signals the end of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` takes a callback function that is called when the stream is closed, whereas `write` does not have a callback function.

DONE.
