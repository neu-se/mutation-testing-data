  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is an object with `value` property, and `callback` and `errback` are functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[0], callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is an array with `0` as the first element, and `callback` and `errback` are functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise that will be resolved or rejected, and `callback` and `errback` are functions that will be called with the resolved or rejected value.

DONE.
