  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this;
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object, which is not intended in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an object and does not have any properties, whereas `this` refers to the GeoPoint object which has properties such as `latitude` and `longitude`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an object and does not have any properties, whereas `this` refers to the GeoPoint object which has properties such as `latitude` and `longitude`.

DONE.
