  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) + 1), cb
```
This change will cause the `updater` function to receive a value that is one greater than the actual value stored in the database, which may cause the `updater` function to produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) - 1), cb
```
This change will cause the `updater` function to receive a value that is one less than the actual value stored in the database, which may cause the `updater` function to produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, updater(this.get(key) * 2), cb
```
This change will cause the `updater` function to receive a value that is twice the actual value stored in the database, which may cause the `updater` function to produce unexpected results.

DONE.
