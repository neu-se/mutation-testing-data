  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the NaN value would cause the code to evaluate to NaN when trying to perform mathematical operations, while the original code would have evaluated to 10.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 0 value would cause the code to evaluate to 0 when trying to perform mathematical operations, while the original code would have evaluated to 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1000, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 1000 value would cause the code to evaluate to a much larger number when trying to perform mathematical operations, while the original code would have evaluated to 10.

DONE.
