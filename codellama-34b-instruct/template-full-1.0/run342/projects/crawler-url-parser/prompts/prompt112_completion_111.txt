  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrlObj = urlMap.values().next().value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the first element of the `urlMap` values iterator to `currentUrlObj`, which would potentially change the behavior of the code that uses `currentUrlObj` later on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrlObj = urlMap.values()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the first element of the `urlMap` values array to `currentUrlObj`, which would potentially change the behavior of the code that uses `currentUrlObj` later on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrlObj = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to `currentUrlObj`, which would potentially change the behavior of the code that uses `currentUrlObj` later on.

DONE.
