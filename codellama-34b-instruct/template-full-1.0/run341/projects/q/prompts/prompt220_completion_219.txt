  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` check would return `undefined` for a property that is not defined, causing the code to enter the `if` block, even if the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property is not set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` check would return `null` for a property that is defined but has the value of `null`, causing the code to enter the `if` block, even if the `process.env.Q_DEBUG` property is not set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` check would return `number` for a property that is defined but has the value of `0`, causing the code to enter the `if` block
