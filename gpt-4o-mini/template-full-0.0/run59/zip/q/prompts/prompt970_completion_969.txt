Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "Extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `name` variable by appending the string "Extra", which changes the method being called on the object, potentially leading to a method that does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method name from a string to the first element of the `args` array, which may not correspond to a valid method on the object, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the method name with `null`, which would cause the dispatch to fail since `null` is not a valid method name, resulting in an error when trying to invoke the method.

DONE.
