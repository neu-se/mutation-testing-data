  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as an argument to `finally`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would be called on the `callback` function, rather than the `callback` function being called directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would be called on the `callback` function, rather than the `callback` function being called directly.

DONE.
