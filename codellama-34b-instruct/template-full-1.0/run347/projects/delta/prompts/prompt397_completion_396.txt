  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method that inserts a retain operation into the delta, whereas `push` inserts a new operation at the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different method that removes a portion of the delta, whereas `push` inserts a new operation at the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherDelta.retain(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherDelta` is a different delta object, and `retain` is a different method that inserts a retain operation into the delta, whereas `push` inserts a new operation at the end of the delta.
DONE.
