  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object with a different message and stack trace than `new TimeoutError()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Request timed out.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object with a different message than `new TimeoutError()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new TimeoutError('Request timed out.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new error object with a different message than `new TimeoutError()`.

DONE.
