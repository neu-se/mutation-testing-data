  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejector` creates a function that rejects a promise, while `makeNodeResolver` creates a function that resolves a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeMapper
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeMapper` creates a function that maps an array of values to an array of promises, while `makeNodeResolver` creates a function that resolves a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolverWithArg
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolverWithArg` creates a function that resolves a promise with an argument, while `makeNodeResolver` creates a function that resolves a promise without any argument.

DONE.
