  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the first element as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the first element as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the first element as intended.

DONE.
