  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when this line of code is not annotated, a null value is returned instead of a node resolver function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    throw new Error('error');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because when the this line of code is not annotated, it will always throw an error instead of returning the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (err) {
    return null;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because when this line of code is not annotated, it will always return null, regardless of the actual value.

DONE.
