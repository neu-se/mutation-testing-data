  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance an additional step, potentially skipping over an important operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to regress an additional step, potentially missing an important operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(firstOther.retain - firstLeft);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to advance to the next operation, potentially skipping over an important operation.

DONE.
