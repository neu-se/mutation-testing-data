  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.set(key)}
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.set(key)` returns `true` which is the opposite of what `this._data.get(key)` was returning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: this._data.get(key) + 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being returned is different from the original one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key, val: 'undefined'}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being returned is different from the original one.

DONE.
