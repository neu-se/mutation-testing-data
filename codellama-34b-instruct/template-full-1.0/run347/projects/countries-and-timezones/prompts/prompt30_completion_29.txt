  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getNumStr` expects a non-negative integer as input, but `(-1)` is a negative number. The original code fragment `getNumStr(min)` is correct because `min` is a non-negative integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(100)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getNumStr` expects a non-negative integer less than 10 as input, but `100` is outside the allowed range. The original code fragment `getNumStr(min)` is correct because `min` is a non-negative integer less than 10.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(num+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getNumStr` expects a non-negative integer as input, but `num+1` may not be a non
