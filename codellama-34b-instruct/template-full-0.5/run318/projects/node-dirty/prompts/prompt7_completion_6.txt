  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be modified, potentially causing the code to access the wrong data in the `_data` map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo' + key
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be concatenated with the string `'foo'`, potentially causing the code to access the wrong data in the `_data` map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable would be converted to lowercase, potentially causing the code to access the wrong data in the `_data` map.

DONE.
