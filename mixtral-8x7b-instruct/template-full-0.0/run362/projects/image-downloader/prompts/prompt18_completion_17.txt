 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./' + decodedBasename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend './' to the destination path, changing the location where the image is saved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.concat(decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the destination path with the decoded basename, changing the location where the image is saved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(process.cwd(), decodedBasename)
