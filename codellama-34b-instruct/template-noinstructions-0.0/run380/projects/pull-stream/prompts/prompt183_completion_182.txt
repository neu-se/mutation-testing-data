  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than the length of the array. This would cause the function to return a different value if the array is empty or if the index `i` is greater than the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than or equal to the length of the array. This would cause the function to return a different value if the array is empty or if the index `i` is equal to the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the
