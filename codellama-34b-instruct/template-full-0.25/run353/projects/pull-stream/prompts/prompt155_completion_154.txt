  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` argument has been moved to the end of the argument list, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the arguments in the wrong order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `null` argument has been added to the end of the argument list, which could potentially cause issues if the function is called with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
