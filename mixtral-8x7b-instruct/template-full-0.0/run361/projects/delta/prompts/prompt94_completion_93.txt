 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes a new empty object instead of using the `newOp` variable, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the `push` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the new operation with the last operation in the array, instead of inserting the new operation at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the new operation to null, which could cause issues when trying to access properties or methods of the `newOp` object in the rest of the `push` method.

DONE.
