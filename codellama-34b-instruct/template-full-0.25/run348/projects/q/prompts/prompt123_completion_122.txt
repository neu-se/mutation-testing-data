  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is used to iterate over the values of an object, while `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the object, while `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key in Object.keys(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the object, while `in` is used to check if a property exists in an object.

DONE.
