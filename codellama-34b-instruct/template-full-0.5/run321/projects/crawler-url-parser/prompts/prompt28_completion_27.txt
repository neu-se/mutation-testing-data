  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a negative lookahead assertion to exclude the string "localhost" from the match, but the modified code fragment does not have this assertion, so it would match URLs that contain "localhost" as a subdomain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "i" flag to make the regular expression case-insensitive, but the modified code fragment does not have this flag, so it would only match URLs that contain "localhost" in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "g" flag to perform a global search and replace, but the modified code fragment does
