 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'goose', 'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'geese' as the plural form of 'goose', but this change would use 'gooses' instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'moose', 'meese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a special rule for 'moose' that returns the same word for singular and plural forms, but this change would use 'meese' as the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'fish', 'fishes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'fish' as the plural form of 'fish' when the quantity is not specified, but this change would use 'fishes' as the plural form.

DONE.
