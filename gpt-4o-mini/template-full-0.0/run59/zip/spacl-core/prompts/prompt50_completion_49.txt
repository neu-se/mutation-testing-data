Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the `part` string to uppercase, which would affect the matching logic and potentially lead to incorrect regex patterns that do not match the intended paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `part` string with its length, which would lead to the regex pattern being constructed incorrectly, as the length is a number and not a valid string for path matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.push(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `part` string itself into the `props` array instead of the intended transformation, which would lead to incorrect property references in the resulting matcher, potentially causing mismatches in path captures.

DONE.
