  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tester
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `tester` variable, which may cause the `filter` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not
```
This would result in different behavior because the `not` property is not defined on the `tester` object, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is not defined, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
