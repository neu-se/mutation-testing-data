  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `head` property of the `ends.promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `tail` property of the `ends.promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the `error` property of the `ends.promise` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
