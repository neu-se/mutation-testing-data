  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!_read
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_read` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `_read` is falsy. This may cause the program to behave differently if `_read` is a null or undefined value, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment assigns the result of the `_read` function to the `_read` variable, but the new code fragment assigns the value `1` to the `_read` variable. This may cause the program to behave differently if the `_read` function returns a different value than `1`, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_read` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `_read + 1
