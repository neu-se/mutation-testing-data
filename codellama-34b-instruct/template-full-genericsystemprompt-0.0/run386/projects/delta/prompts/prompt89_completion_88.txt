  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to be `null`, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to be `undefined`, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `attributes` property of the `newOp` object to be an empty object, which is not allowed in the original code.

DONE.
