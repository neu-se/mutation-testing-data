  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` is a different property than `ret.host` and would return the hostname without the port number, if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.protocol` is a different property than `ret.host` and would return the URL's protocol, such as "http" or "https".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.href` is a different property than `ret.host` and would return the full URL as a string, including the protocol, host, port, path, and query string.

DONE.
