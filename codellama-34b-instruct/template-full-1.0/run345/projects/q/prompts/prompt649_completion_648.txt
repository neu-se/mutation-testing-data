  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `args` array as a parameter to the `post` method, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as the second argument to the `post` method, whereas the original code passes the `args` array as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, [args[0]]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as a parameter to the `post` method, whereas the original code passes the entire `args` array.

DONE.
