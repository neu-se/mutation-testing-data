  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the specified reason, whereas `become` is a function that resolves the promise with the specified new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the specified progress, whereas `become` is a function that resolves the promise with the specified new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise that resolves with the specified new promise, whereas `become` is a function that resolves the promise with the specified new promise.

DONE.
