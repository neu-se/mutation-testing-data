  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the `data` argument. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the `data` argument to be passed to the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the `err` and `data` arguments. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the `err` and `data` arguments to be passed to the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the `null` argument
