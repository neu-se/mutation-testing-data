  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `point2Rad`, which would change the calculation of `r` and potentially lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `point2Rad`, which would change the calculation of `r` and potentially lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `point2Rad`, which would change the calculation of `r` and potentially lead to a different result.

DONE.
