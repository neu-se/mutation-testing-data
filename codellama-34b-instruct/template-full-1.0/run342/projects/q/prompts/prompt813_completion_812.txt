  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that logs a message to the console, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a value that should be passed as an argument to the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument for the `then` method, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a value that should be passed as an argument to the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Placeholder")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Placeholder")` is a statement that throws an error, while `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a value that should be passed as an argument to the `then` method.

DONE.
