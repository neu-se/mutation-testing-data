  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `min` is no longer greater than 0, so the `any` flag is not set, and the resulting regex pattern would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max > min
```
This would result in different behavior because `max` is now checked against `min`, which would affect the branching behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any || max >= min
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` flag is now checked before comparing `max` and `min`, which would affect the branching behavior of the code.

DONE.
