  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'j'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the characters 'i' or 'I', whereas the replaced code fragment also checks for the character 'j'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks for the characters 'i' or 'I', whereas the replaced code fragment also checks for the character 'e'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'i' || tokens[i + 1] === 'I' || tokens[i + 1] === 'Ï€'
```
