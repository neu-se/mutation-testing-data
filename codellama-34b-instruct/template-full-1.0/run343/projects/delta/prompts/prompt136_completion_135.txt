  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const firstOther = otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to peek at the next value in the sequence, rather than the current value, which could potentially return a different value and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const firstOther = otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>. next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to peek at the next value in the sequence, rather than the current value, which could potentially return a different value and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const firstOther = otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>. previous());
