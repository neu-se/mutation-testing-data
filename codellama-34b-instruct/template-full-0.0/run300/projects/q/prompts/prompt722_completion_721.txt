  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled" && promise.inspect().value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled and the value is undefined, which would be different from the original code that checks if the promise is fulfilled and the value is not undefined.

DONE.
