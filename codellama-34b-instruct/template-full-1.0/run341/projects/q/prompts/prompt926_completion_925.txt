  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with `callback` as the value, but the replaced code would resolve with an empty function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with `callback` as the value, but the replaced code would resolve with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would resolve the promise with `callback` as the value, but the replaced code would resolve with an arrow function that returns `undefined`.

DONE.
