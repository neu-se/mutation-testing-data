  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable would not be returned if it is an internal frame or a Node frame, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) || !isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable would be returned if it is not an internal frame or a Node frame, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame(line) && isNodeFrame(line)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line` variable would be returned if it is both an internal frame and a Node frame, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return a different value than the original
