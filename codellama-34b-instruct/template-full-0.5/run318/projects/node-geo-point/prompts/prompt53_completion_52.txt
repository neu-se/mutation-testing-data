  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 360` would cause the bearing to always be positive, even if the longitude difference is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the bearing to be twice as large as it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 180` would cause the bearing to be 180 degrees different from what it should be.

DONE.
