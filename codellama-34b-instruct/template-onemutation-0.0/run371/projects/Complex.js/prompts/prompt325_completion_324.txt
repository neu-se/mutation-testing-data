  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. While `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine. In the context of the code, replacing `cosh` with `sinh` would cause the function to return the wrong value, leading to a bug.

DONE.
