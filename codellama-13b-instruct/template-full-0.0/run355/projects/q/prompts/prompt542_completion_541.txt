  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire array, while this code fragment returns the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire array, while this code fragment returns the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire array, while this code fragment returns a new array containing all but the first element of the original array.

DONE.
