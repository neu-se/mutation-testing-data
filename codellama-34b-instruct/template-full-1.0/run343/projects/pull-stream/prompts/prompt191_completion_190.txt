  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```pdf
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` variable is not declared, and therefore the code would not run correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```php
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is now a function, and the code would attempt to call it as a function, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```html
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` variable is now a string, and the code would attempt to use it as an object, which would result in an error.

DONE.
