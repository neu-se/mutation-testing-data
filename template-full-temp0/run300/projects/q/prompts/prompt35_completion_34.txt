  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console, whereas the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "This is a buggy code fragment";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string, whereas the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
