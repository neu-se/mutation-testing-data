  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when the `retain` property is present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.insert` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when the `insert` property is present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.attributes` is a different property than `elem.delete`, and it would cause the code to behave differently when the `attributes` property is present.

DONE.
