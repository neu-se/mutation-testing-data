  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is not a string and toString() might not behave as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is not a string and toLowerCase() might not behave as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument is not a number and adding 1 might not produce a meaningful result.

DONE.
