 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a instanceof Function && a.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `a` is an instance of the `Function` constructor instead of using the `typeof` operator. This change may pass in some cases but fail in others, depending on how the `a` variable is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected `length` of the function `a` from 1 to 0. This would cause the code to behave differently, as it would not pass any arguments to the `pull` function when calling it recursively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'function' && a.constructor.name === 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `constructor` property of `a` has the name `'Function'`. This is
