  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!test(data)` expression would be evaluated first and the result would always be `false`, causing the `if` statement to never be entered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!test(data)` expression would be evaluated first and the result would always be `true`, causing the `if` statement to always be entered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?:` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!test(data)` expression would be evaluated first and the result would be the opposite of what it would be with the original code, causing the `if` statement
