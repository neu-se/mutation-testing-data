  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` is a method that removes the first element of an array and returns it, whereas `unshift` is a method that adds an element to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element of an array and returns it, whereas `unshift` is a method that adds an element to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.

DONE.
