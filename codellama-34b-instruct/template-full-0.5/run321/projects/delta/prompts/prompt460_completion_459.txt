  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `slice` method to start from the next index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `slice` method to start from the previous index instead of the current one, potentially returning a different subset of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(this.index - 1, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.max` function would ensure that the starting index is at least 0, which could potentially cause the `slice` method to return a different subset of the `ops` array.

DONE.
