  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isLoopBreak
```
This would result in different behavior because `isLoopBreak` is a different property than `isStopIteration`, and the code would execute differently if the value of `isLoopBreak` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isContinue
```
This would result in different behavior because `isContinue` is a different property than `isStopIteration`, and the code would execute differently if the value of `isContinue` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a different property than `isStopIteration`, and the code would execute differently if the value of `isRejected` is truthy.

DONE.
