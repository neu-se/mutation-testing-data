 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns a value between -1 and 1, while `cosh` returns a positive value for any real argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(-a) * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `e^(-a) / 2` instead of `(e^c + e^(-c)) / 2`, changing the output for negative `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.exp(a) * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates `0.5 / e^a` instead of `(e^c + e^(-c)) / 2`, changing the output for positive `a`.

DONE.
