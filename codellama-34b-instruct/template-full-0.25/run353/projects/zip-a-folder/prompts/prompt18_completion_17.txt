  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator is used instead of the bitwise OR operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `access` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise XOR operator is used instead of the bitwise OR operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `access` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK + fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is used instead of the bitwise OR operator, which would result in a different value being passed to the `access` method.

DONE.
