  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which could result in different side effects or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` argument is not passed to the `_fulfilled` function, which could result in different side effects or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exception` argument is not passed to the `_rejected` function, which could result in different side effects or behavior.

DONE.
