 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"allSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name is changed, and the original `allResolved` function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolved(promises) {
    return Q(promises).all();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function now uses the `all` method instead of the original implementation, which waits for all promises to be settled, not just fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function allResolved(promises) {
    return Q(promises).all().then(function(results) {
        return Q.resolve(results.map(function(result) {
            return { state: result.state, value: result.value };
        }));
    });
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved
