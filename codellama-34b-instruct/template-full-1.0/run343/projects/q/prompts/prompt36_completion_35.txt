  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(typeof window !== "undefined")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is not being used in the code, and the code is checking if the `window` object is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is not being used in the code, and the code is checking if `isNodeJS` is equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeJS !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNodeJS` variable is not being used in the code, and the code is checking if `isNodeJS` is not equal to `true`.

DONE.
