  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the link URL has fewer path parts than the page URL, it would return "uplevel" instead of "internal".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the link URL has more path parts than the page URL, it would return "sublevel" instead of "internal".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts[linkurl_parts.length - 1] !== pageurl_parts[pageurl_parts.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because if the last part of the link URL path is not the same as the last part of the page URL path, it would return "internal" instead of "samelevel".

DONE.
