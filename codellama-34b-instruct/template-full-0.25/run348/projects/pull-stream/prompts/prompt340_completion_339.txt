  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current element being processed by the `filter` function, while `data + 1` would be a reference to the next element. This change would cause the `filter` function to skip over every other element, which could result in a different set of elements being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current element being processed by the `filter` function, while `data - 1` would be a reference to the previous element. This change would cause the `filter` function to include the previous element in the result set, which could result in a different set of elements being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the current
