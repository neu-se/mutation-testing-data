  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `when` is a function that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the given arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, while `when` is a function that returns a promise that resolves or rejects based on the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject("error")` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the error message "error".
