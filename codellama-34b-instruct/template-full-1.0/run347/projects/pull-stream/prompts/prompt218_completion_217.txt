  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `err` object as an argument to the `cb` function, instead of passing the `err` object and the `cb` function as separate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the first argument to the `cb` function, instead of passing the `err` object as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `false` as the first argument to the `cb` function, instead of passing the `err` object as the first argument.

DONE.
