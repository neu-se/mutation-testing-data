  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `ended` and `end` are truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `ended` is falsy and `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `ended` and `end` are truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy or `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `ended` and `end` are truthy, while this new code fragment checks if `ended` is truthy and `end` is truthy.

DONE.
