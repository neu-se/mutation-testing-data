  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === NaN || longitude === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number", and it is not equal to any other value, including itself. Therefore, this code fragment would always evaluate to `false`, even if `latitude` and `longitude` are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === Infinity || longitude === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents a value that is infinite in magnitude, and it is not equal to any other value, including itself. Therefore, this code fragment would always evaluate to `false`, even if `latitude` and `longitude` are not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object
