  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.min(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `peekLength()` method of `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to different results in the `diff()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `max()` method instead of `min()`, which could lead to different results in the `diff()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = Math.abs(otherIter.peekLength() - length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `abs()` method instead of `min()`, which could lead to different results in the `diff()` method.

DONE.
