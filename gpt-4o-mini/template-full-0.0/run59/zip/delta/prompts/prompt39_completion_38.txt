Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow both `null` and `undefined` values in `a` to be treated as valid, thus potentially overwriting values in `b` that should not be overwritten when `priority` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the case where `a[key]` is explicitly `null` to proceed, ignoring `undefined` values, which could lead to unexpected overwriting of values in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `b[key]` is defined instead of checking `a[key]`, which could lead to incorrect attribute assignments and potentially overwrite valid values in `b` based on the presence of keys in `b` rather than `a`.

DONE.
