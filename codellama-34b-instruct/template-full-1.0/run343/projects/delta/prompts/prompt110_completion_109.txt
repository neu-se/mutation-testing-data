  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always retain the attribute, regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the attribute, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete the attribute, regardless of its value.

DONE.
