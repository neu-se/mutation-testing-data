Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.parse` returns an object with information about the path, including the root directory. This change would cause the `checkParentPaths` function to stop recursing too early, potentially allowing a destination path that is a subdirectory of the source path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.cwd` returns the current working directory, whereas `path.parse` returns the root directory of a given path. This change would cause the `checkParentPaths` function to always compare the destination path's parent to the current working directory, rather than the root directory of the destination path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because this anonymous function always returns the root directory '/', whereas `path.parse` returns the root directory of a given path. This change would cause the `checkParentPaths` function to always stop recursing when it reaches the root directory '/', potentially allowing a
