  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `this._queue` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `pop()` method to remove the last element from the `this._queue` object and assigns it to the `key` and `cbs` variables. The `pop()` method returns `undefined` if the array is empty, which would cause the `for...of` loop to terminate immediately, while the `for...of` loop would continue to iterate over the remaining elements in the `this._queue` object.
