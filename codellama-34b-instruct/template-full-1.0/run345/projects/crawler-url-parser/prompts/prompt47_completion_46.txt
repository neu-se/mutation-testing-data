  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not include the `pathname` in the parsed URL, which could result in incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the `hostname` and `port` in the parsed URL, which could result in incorrect parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the `hostname` but not the `port` in the parsed URL, which could result in incorrect parsing of the URL.

DONE.
