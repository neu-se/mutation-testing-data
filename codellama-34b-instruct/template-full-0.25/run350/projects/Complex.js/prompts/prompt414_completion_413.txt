  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+` while this code fragment uses `-`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+ 1` while this code fragment uses `- 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+` while this code fragment uses `*`.

DONE.
