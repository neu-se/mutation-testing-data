 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the square root of the sum of squares of `a` and `b` without the square root, while the modified version includes the square root, which would lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (1 + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified version calculates the reciprocal of the expression, which would lead to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the modified version calculates the exponential of the expression, which would lead to much larger results than the original code fragment.

DONE.
