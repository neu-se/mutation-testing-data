 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` immediately returns a resolved promise, while the original code uses the `Q` function which might have additional logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Timeout'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately rejects the promise with a timeout error, instead of waiting for the specified time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object and returns its promise, which might have different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
