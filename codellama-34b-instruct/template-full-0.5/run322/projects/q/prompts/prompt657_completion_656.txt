  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an empty array instead of an array of invocation arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an array of invocation arguments, but the first argument would be `undefined` instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` would return an array of invocation arguments, but the first argument would be the string "foo" instead of a reference to the function's `this` value.

DONE.
