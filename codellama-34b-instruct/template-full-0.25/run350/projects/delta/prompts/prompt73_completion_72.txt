  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, instead of inserting it at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, instead of inserting it at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the specified index, instead of inserting it at the current index.

DONE.
