  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because the "args" argument is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the "then" method is not called on the "promise" argument in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the "Q.promise" method is not called on the "promise" argument in the original code fragment.

DONE.
