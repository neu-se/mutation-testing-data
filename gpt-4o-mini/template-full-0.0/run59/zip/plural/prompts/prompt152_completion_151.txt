Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the input as if the quantity is one greater than it actually is, leading to incorrect pluralization for singular nouns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize words when the number is zero, which is not the intended behavior for pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly handle the case where `num` is exactly 1, treating it as plural instead of singular, thus returning the plural form for singular nouns.

DONE.
