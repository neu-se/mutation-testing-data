  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'load'` to `'error'`, which would cause the code to execute the error handling logic instead of the load handling logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is changed from `0` to `1`, which would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is changed from `0` to `null`, which would cause the `load` event to be emitted with a different value.

DONE.
