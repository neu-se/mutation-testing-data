  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would return -1 instead of the actual index of the element in the array, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not remove the element from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.
