  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the status code 300 is a valid HTTP status code, but it is not the same as 200, which is the status code that the original code fragment was checking for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was only checking for the status code 200, but this new code fragment is checking for both 200 and 300.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 || res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the status code 200, but this new code fragment is checking for either 200 or 300.

DONE.
