  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object value. In the original code, `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, but `b === null` checks if `b` is exactly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if `b` is an instance of a particular class, but `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor.name === 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.constructor.name` returns the name of the constructor function that created the `b` object, but `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
