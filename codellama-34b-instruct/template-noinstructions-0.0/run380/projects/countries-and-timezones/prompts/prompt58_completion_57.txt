  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it would not memoize the country object as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(timezone)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would memoize the timezone object as a country, which would cause unexpected behavior in the `getCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry(country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would memoize the country object as a country, which would cause unexpected behavior in the `getCountry` function.

DONE.
