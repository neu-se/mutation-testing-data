  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the callbacks if there are no errors, while this modified code fragment executes the callbacks if there are errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length && err == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the callbacks if there are no errors, while this modified code fragment executes the callbacks if there are no errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length > 0 && err == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the callbacks if there are no errors, while this modified code fragment executes the callbacks if there are no errors and there are callbacks to execute.

DONE.
