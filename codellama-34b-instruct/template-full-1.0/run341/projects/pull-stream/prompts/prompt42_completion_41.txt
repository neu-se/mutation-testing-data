  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would be passed as the first argument to the apply method, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the undefined value would be passed as the first argument to the apply method, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be passed as the first argument to the apply method, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
