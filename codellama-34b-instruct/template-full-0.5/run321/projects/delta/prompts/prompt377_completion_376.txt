  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` is a method that returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without parentheses refers to the method itself, which is not a valid operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType` returns the type of the next operation, which can be either `'insert'`, `'delete'`, or `'retain'`. By comparing `peekType` to the string `'retain'`, we are checking whether the next operation is a retain operation, which is not the same as checking whether the next operation is an insert operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, which can be different from the length of
