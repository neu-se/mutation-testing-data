  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a comma-separated list of values, while this replacement would create a single value that is the concatenation of `op` and `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a comma-separated list of values, while this replacement would create a single value that is the difference between `op` and `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args
```
This would not result in different behavior because the original code fragment is already expecting a comma-separated list of values, and this replacement would keep the same behavior.

DONE.
