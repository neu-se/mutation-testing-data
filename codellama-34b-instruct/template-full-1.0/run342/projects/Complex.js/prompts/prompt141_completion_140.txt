  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the base is fully imaginary, whereas the original code would return `Complex['NAN']` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the absolute value of the complex number, whereas the original code would return the complex number itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a real number, whereas the original code would return a complex number.

DONE.
