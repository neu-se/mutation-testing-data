  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is missing, which would cause the parts of the path to be in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join('/')` method is added, which would cause the parts of the path to be joined with a forward slash, even if they were originally separated by a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join('')` method is added, which would cause the parts of the path to be joined with an empty string, effectively removing any slashes that were originally present.

DONE.
