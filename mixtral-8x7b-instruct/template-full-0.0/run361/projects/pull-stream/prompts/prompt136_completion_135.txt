 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would always execute with a false error value, regardless of the input `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would always execute with a number as the error value, rather than the input `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err || 'An error occurred')
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would execute with a string as the error value when `err` is falsy, rather than propagating the original error.

DONE.
