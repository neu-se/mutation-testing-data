  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== test
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb !== test` is a different condition than `!cb`, and it would cause the `cb = test, test = id` assignment to be skipped if `cb` is not equal to `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== id
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb !== id` is a different condition than `!cb`, and it would cause the `cb = test, test = id` assignment to be skipped if `cb` is not equal to `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test !== id
```
This would result in different behavior because `test !== id` is a different condition than `!cb`, and it would cause the `cb = test, test = id` assignment to be skipped if `test` is not equal to `id`.

DONE.
