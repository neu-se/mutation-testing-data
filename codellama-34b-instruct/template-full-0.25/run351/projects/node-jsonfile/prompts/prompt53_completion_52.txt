  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function would not be called, and the resulting JSON string would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = (key, value) => value.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function would be called with each key-value pair in the JSON object, and the resulting JSON string would have all values converted to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer = (key, value) => value.replace(/[a-z]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function would be called with each key-value pair in the JSON object, and the resulting JSON string would have all values with lowercase letters removed.

DONE.
