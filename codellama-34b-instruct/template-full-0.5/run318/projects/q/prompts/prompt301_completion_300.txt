  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the elements in the array would be reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would have duplicate elements, which could cause issues in the code that uses the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array would have two null elements, which could cause issues in the code that uses the array.

DONE.
