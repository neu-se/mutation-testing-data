 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds down instead of up, which can change the result for some input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because it rounds to the nearest integer, which can change the result for some input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the real part by the number of decimal places instead of dividing, which can change the result for some input values.

DONE.
