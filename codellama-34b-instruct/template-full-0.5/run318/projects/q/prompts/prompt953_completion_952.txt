  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected. If the promise is resolved, using `done` instead of `fail` would cause the code to execute the success handler instead of the error handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected. If the promise is resolved, using `then` instead of `fail` would cause the code to execute the success handler instead of the error handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method
