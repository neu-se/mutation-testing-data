  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` executes a provided function once for each element of the array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
