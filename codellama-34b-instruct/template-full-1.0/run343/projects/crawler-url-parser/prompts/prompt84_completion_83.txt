  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("src");
```
This would result in a different value being assigned to the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object, because the `src` attribute of an HTML element is different from its text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).css("color");
```
This would result in a different value being assigned to the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object, because the `color` CSS property of an HTML element is different from its text content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).css("background-color");
```
This would result in a different value being assigned to the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object, because the `background-color` CSS property of an HTML element is different from its text content.

DONE.
