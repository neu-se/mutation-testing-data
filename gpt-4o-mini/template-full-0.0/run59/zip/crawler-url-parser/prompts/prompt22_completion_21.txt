Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from 'http://' to 'https://', which could lead to incorrect URL parsing if the original URL was intended to be accessed over HTTP.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the protocol with 'ftp://', which is not suitable for web URLs and could cause the URL parsing to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the protocol entirely, leading to a malformed URL that may not be parsed correctly, resulting in potential errors or unexpected behavior in subsequent URL handling.

DONE.
