  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not defined in the current scope, and the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not defined in the current scope, and the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not defined in the current scope, and the code would throw a ReferenceError.

DONE.
