 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Promise.resolve(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would not receive the original rejection reason, but instead a fulfilled promise. This could lead to masking of errors and unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('New error'); }
