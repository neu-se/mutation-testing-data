  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the glob pattern, rather than all parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the rest of the glob pattern, rather than all parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the number of parts in the glob pattern, rather than the actual parts themselves.

DONE.
