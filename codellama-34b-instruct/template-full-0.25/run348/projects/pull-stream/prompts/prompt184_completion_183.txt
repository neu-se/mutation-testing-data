  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator will decrement the value of `i` by 1, causing the function to return the previous element in the array instead of the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` expression will return the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i * 2])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i * 2` expression will return the current element in the array multiplied by 2, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
