  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` is not equal to `a` when `a` is not zero, and the `Math.cos(b)` and `Math.sin(b)` functions could return different values when the argument is not zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is not equal to `b` when `b` is not zero, and the `Math.cos(b)` and `Math.sin(b)` functions could return different values when the argument is not zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is not equal to `a` when `b` is not zero, and the `Math.cos(b)` and `Math.sin(b)` functions could return different values when the argument is not zero.
