  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which could lead to unexpected results in the `round` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the imaginary part to the real part before multiplying by `places`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `round` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the imaginary part from the real part before multiplying by `places`, which could lead to unexpected results in the `round` method.

DONE.
