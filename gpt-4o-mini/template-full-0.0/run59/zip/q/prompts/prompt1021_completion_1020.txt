Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, "extraArg"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument ("extraArg") to the array being dispatched, which could lead to unexpected results or errors if the method being called does not expect this extra argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the `name` and `nodeArgs` in the dispatched array, which could cause the method being called to interpret the arguments incorrectly, potentially leading to runtime errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs.length, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `nodeArgs` array with its length, which is a number, instead of the actual arguments. This would likely cause the method being called to fail since it would not receive the expected arguments.

DONE.
