  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'end' event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data is flushed to the output stream, whereas the 'error' event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'finish' event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data is flushed to the output stream, whereas the 'error' event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event is emitted when the output stream is closed, whereas the 'error' event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process.

DONE.
