  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by `Math.PI / 180` would cause the bearing to be converted to radians, which would result in a different calculation for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 180 would cause the bearing to be shifted by 180 degrees, which would result in a different calculation for the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would cause the bearing to be doubled, which would result in a different calculation for the destination point.

DONE.
