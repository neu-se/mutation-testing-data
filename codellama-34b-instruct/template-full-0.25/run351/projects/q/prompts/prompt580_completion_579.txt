  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `throw` argument, which would cause the `continuer` function to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function with a `null` context, which would cause the `continuer` function to be called with the `throw` argument, which would cause the `continuer` function to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function
