  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is being called on the `urlMap` object, which is not a valid method for that object. The `delete` method is used to remove properties from an object, but `urlMap` is a `Map` object, which does not have that method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is being called on the `urlMap` object, which is not a valid method for that object. The `clear` method is used to remove all elements from a `Map` object, but `urlMap` is a `Map` object, which does not have that method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is being called on the `urlMap`
