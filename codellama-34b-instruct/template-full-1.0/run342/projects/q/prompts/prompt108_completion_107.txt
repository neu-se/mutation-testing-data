  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the decrement operator `i--` is different from the increment operator `i++` and would cause the iteration over the array to happen in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration over the array to skip every other element and would only consider elements with even indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i -= 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration over the array to consider only elements with indices greater than or equal to 10 and would skip all previous elements.

DONE.
