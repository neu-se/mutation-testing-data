  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero if halfway between two integers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` always rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero if halfway between two integers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` always rounds towards zero, while `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero if halfway between two integers.

DONE.
