  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression global and causes it to match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added, which makes the regular expression multi-line, so it would match both the beginning and end of lines, as well as the beginning and end of the string.

DONE.
