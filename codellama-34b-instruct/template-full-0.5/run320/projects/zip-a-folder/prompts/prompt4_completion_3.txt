  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always compress the file, regardless of the compression level specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression > COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only compress the file if the compression level is higher than uncompressed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression >= COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only compress the file if the compression level is at least medium.

DONE.
