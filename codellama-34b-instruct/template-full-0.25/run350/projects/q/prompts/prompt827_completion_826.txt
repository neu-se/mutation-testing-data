  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would no longer be called when an unhandled error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would throw an error when called, which would cause the program to terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would log a message to the console when called, but would not throw an error or terminate the program.

DONE.
