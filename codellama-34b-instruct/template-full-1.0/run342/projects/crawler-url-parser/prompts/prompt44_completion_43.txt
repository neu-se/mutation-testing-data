  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```String.length = 0;```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `baseUrlStr` variable to be a string and checks its length. By setting the length of this variable to 0, the code would throw an error for the length property of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```baseUrlStr = null;```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes that `baseUrlStr` is a non-null string and uses its properties and methods. By setting `baseUrlStr` to null, the code would throw a null reference error when it tries to use the null object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://');```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not replace the double slash at the beginning of `baseUrlStr`. By adding this replace method, the code would remove the double slash from the beginning of the string, which could cause issues if the base
