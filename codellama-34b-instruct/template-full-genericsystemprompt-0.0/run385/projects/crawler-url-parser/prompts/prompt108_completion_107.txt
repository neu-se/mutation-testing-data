  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL multiple times, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "?" + currentUrl.search
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL with different query parameters, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "#" + currentUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `urlMap` to contain the same URL with different hash fragments, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
