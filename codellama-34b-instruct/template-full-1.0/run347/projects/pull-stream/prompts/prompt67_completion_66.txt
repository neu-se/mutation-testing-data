  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always equal to itself, so the expression would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy when it is not `null` or `undefined`, so the expression would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always falsy when it is `null` or `undefined`, so the expression would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `end`.

DONE.
