  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function, which returns the sine of an angle, while the replaced code fragment uses the `cos` function, which returns the cosine of an angle. This would cause the calculation of `sinφ2` to produce a different result, which would in turn affect the calculation of `φ2` and the final result of the `calculateDestination` method.
