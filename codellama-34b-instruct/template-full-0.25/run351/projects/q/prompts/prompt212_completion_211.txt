  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `===` checks if two values are equal. In this case, `Promise` is a constructor function, and `value === Promise` would only be true if `value` is the `Promise` constructor function itself, not an instance of it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `constructor` is a property of an object that refers to the constructor function that created the object. In this case, `value.constructor === Promise` would be true if `value` is an instance of the `Promise` constructor function, but not if `value` is the `Promise` constructor function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(value) === Promise.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.getPro
