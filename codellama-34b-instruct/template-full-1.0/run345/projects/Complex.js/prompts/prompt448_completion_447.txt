  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, while `Math.round` returns the integer that is closest to a given number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to a given number, while `Math.round` returns the integer that is closest to a given number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(Math.floor(this['im'] * places) / places).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the result of `Math.floor` to a string before using it.

DONE.
