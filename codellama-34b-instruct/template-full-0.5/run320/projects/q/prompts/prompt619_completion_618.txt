  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key, "wrongKey"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with a different key than expected, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with an undefined value for the second argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would be called with a null value for the second argument, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
