  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the imaginary part of the complex number to always be 1, which is not always the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the imaginary part of the complex number to be always different from the real part, which is not always the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number to always be zero, which is not always the case.

DONE.
