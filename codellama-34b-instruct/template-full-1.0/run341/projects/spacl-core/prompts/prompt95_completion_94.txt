  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy` returns a `Policy` object, whereas `null` would return a null reference, which could cause the `push` method to fail if it's used to add a new policy to the collection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy` returns a `Policy` object, whereas `undefined` would return an undefined value, which could cause the `push` method to fail if it's used to add a new policy to the collection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `policy` returns the `Policy` object that was passed as an argument, whereas `new Policy()` would return a new `Policy` object that is not the same as the one passed as an argument. This could cause the `push` method to fail if it's
