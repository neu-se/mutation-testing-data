  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `/` as the delimiter for the `split` method, while the replaced code uses `\\` as the delimiter. This would cause the `split` method to return a different array of strings, which would in turn affect the `filter` method and the overall behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `/` as the delimiter for the `split` method, while the replaced code uses a space character as the delimiter. This would cause the `split` method to return a different array of strings, which would in turn affect the `filter` method and the overall behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"|"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `/` as the delimiter for the `split` method, while the replaced code uses a pipe character (`|`) as the
