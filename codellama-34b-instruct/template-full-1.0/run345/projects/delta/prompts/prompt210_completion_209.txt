  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-empty array of operations, but `0` is not an array and would cause an error if used as one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-empty array of operations, but an empty array would not cause any errors but would silently do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-empty array of operations, but an array containing a single `null` element would cause an error if used as a delta.

DONE.
