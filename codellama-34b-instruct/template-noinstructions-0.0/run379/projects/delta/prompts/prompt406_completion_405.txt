  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `embedType` variable is a string, and adding the string '1' to it would change its value, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `embedType` string to uppercase, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `embedType` string into an array of individual characters, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
