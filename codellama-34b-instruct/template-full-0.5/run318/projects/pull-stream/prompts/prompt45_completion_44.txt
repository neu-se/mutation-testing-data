  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && read.source !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means that the code would execute the `if` block if `read.source` is not a function, even if it is a function with a different name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks for the type of the value, and `'object'` is a valid type for a function, but it is not the same as the type of a function with a specific name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && read.source.name === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of a function is not the same as the function itself, and the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the code would execute the `if` block if `read.
