  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() ||
            isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of `otherIter.hasNext()`, causing the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
            isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType()` method is not being called on `otherIter`, so the loop will continue even if the next operation is not an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() &&
            isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method is
