  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only dispatches the "set" operation if the object is a promise, while this replacement code fragment would always dispatch the "set" operation, regardless of whether the object is a promise or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only dispatches the "get" operation if the object is a promise, while this replacement code fragment would always dispatch the "get" operation, regardless of whether the object is a promise or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only dispatches the "delete" operation if the object is a promise, while this replacement code fragment would always dispatch the "delete" operation, regardless of whether the object
