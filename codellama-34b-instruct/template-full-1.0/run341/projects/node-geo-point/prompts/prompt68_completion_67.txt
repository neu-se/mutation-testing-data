  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a reference to the variable `x`, which is presumably a number. The changed code fragment `x + 1` would add 1 to the value of `x`, which could potentially result in different behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a reference to the variable `x`, which is presumably a number. The changed code fragment `y` is a reference to a different variable `y`, which could have a different value than `x`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a reference to the variable `x`, which is presumably a number. The changed code fragment `x * x` would square the value of `x`, which could potentially result in different behavior
