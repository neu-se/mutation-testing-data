  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function, which is a more accurate method for calculating the principal value of the argument of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function, which is a more accurate method for calculating the principal value of the argument of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `atan2` function, which is a more accurate method for calculating the principal value of the argument of a complex number.

DONE.
