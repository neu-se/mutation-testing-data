 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).npost(null, name, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `npost` method expects only two arguments, `name` and `args`, but this modification includes an additional `null` argument, which could cause unexpected results or errors in the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q(object).post
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `Q` object, and attempting to call it would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.npost(name, args, object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of arguments passed to the `npost` method has been changed. The original `npost` method expects the `object` argument to be the first argument, followed by the `name` and `args` arguments. Changing the order of arguments would cause
