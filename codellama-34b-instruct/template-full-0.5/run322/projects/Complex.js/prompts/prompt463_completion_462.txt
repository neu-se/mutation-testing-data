  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.abs(b)` to ensure that the comparison is done with the absolute value of `b`, while the new code fragment compares `b` directly without taking the absolute value. This could cause the test to pass even if `b` is negative, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `Math.abs(b)` to ensure that the comparison is done with the absolute value of `b`, while the new code fragment uses `Math.abs(b)` in the comparison but also includes the `=` operator to check if `b` is equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`. This could cause the test to pass even if `b` is slightly larger than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which could lead to incorrect results.
