  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is not being called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data) && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is being called with the `data` argument, which may not be what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data) && false === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function is being called with the `data` argument, which may not be what the original code intended.

DONE.
