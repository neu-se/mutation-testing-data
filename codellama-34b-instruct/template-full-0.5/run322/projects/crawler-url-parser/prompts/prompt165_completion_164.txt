  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `includes()` method, which is case-sensitive, while the modified code uses the `toLowerCase()` method to convert the string to lowercase before checking for inclusion. This could result in a different outcome if the input string contains uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `includes()` method to check if the substring is included in the original string, while the modified code uses the `slice()` method to extract a substring from the original string starting from the second character. This could result in a different outcome if the input string contains a substring that is not included in the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `includes()`
