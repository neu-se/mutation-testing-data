  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method returns an object with `pathname`, `search`, and `hash` properties, but the `URL.format()` method only uses the `pathname` property to create the URL string. By using `absoluteUrl.search`, the resulting URL would not include the query string or fragment identifier.

absoluteUrl.hash
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method returns an object with `path
