  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` is a method that returns the length of the next op in the iterator, while `peekLength` is a property that refers to the length of the current op. Using `peekLength()` instead of `peekLength` would cause the code to behave differently when the next op is an insertion or a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` refers to the length of the next op in the other iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength()` refers to the length of the current op in the current iterator. Using `otherIter.peekLength()` instead of `thisIter.peekLength()` would cause the code to behave differently when the next op is an insertion or a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.
