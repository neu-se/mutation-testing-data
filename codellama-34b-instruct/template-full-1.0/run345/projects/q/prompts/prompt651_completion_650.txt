  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on the dispatched promise, which could lead to a different resolution or rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on the dispatched promise, which could lead to a different resolution or rejection of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a runtime error, as there is no `foo` method on the dispatched promise.

DONE.
