  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/section\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the final `/index.` with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the final `/section.` with a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the final `/index.` with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the final substring that matches the pattern `/[a-z]+.` with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/prefix\/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only replaces the final `/index.` with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the final substring that matches the pattern `/prefix\/[a
