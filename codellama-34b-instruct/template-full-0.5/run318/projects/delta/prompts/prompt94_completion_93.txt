  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the `newOp` object to the `ops` array, which would cause the `insert` method to fail to insert the new operation into the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the `newOp` object to the `ops` array, which would cause the `insert` method to fail to insert the new operation into the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add an object with an `insert` property set to `null` to the `ops` array, which would cause the `insert` method to fail to insert the new operation into the array.

DONE.
