  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to compare the `delete` property of the two operations, rather than the `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to compare the `retain` property of the two operations, rather than the `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to compare the `insert` property of the first operation to the `retain` property of the second operation, rather than the `insert` property of both operations.

DONE.
