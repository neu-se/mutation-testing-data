  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would not be called, as the `definition` variable is being referenced before it is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const definition = function() { throw new Error("Mock Error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because a mock error would be thrown when the `definition` function is called, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition.bind(null, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `definition` function would be called with the specified arguments, causing the promise to resolve with a different value.

DONE.
