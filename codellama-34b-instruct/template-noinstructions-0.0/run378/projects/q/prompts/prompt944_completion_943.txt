  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the promise returned by `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)`, which means that any errors that occur during the execution of the `bound` function will not be caught and handled by the `deferred.reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)`, which means that any errors that occur during the execution of the `bound` function will be caught and handled by the `deferred.reject` function. However, the `deferred.resolve` function will not be called if the `bound` function returns a value, which means that the promise returned by `Q.nbind
