  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would refer to the second element of the `ref` array, while the original code fragment referred to the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would add the values of the first and second elements of the `ref` array, while the original code fragment referred to the second element only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.get(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would get the value at index 1 of the `ref` array, while the original code fragment referred to the second element.

DONE.
