  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert a new op at the end of the ops array, regardless of the index passed to the `splice` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert a new op at the beginning of the ops array, regardless of the index passed to the `splice` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert a new op at the end of the ops array, regardless of the index passed to the `splice` method.

DONE.
