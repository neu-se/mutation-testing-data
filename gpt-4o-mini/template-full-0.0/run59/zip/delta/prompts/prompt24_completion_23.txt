Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the value of `a[key]` with `a[key]` instead of comparing it with `b[key]`, which would always evaluate to `true` if `a[key]` is defined, leading to incorrect diff results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider `a[key]` to be different from `undefined`, causing all keys in `a` to be included in the resulting attributes, regardless of their actual values in `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `a[key]` to be different if `b[key]` is explicitly `null`, ignoring other falsy values (like `undefined` or `0`), which could lead to missing attributes in the diff result.

DONE.
