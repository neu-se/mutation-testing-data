  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function is called instead of the `resolve` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error('Custom error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a custom error message instead of the original code fragment, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(zipArchive)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with the `zipArchive` object instead of the original code fragment, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

DONE.
