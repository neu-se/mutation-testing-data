  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the start position of the slice would be incremented by 1, which could potentially result in a different slice being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the start position of the slice would be decremented by 1, which could potentially result in a different slice being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the start position of the slice would be incremented by 2, which could potentially result in a different slice being returned.

DONE.
