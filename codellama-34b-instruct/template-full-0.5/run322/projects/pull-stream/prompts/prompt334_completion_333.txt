  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `end` is a truthy value. When `end` is passed to the callback, it will be treated as a truthy value, causing the callback to execute. When `null` is passed to the callback, it will be treated as a falsy value, causing the callback to not execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `end` is a truthy value. When `end` is passed to the callback, it will be treated as a truthy value, causing the callback to execute. When `undefined` is passed to the callback, it will be treated as a falsy value, causing the callback to not execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value,
