  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, meaning that `this.offset` would not be equal to `0` even if it was originally `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, meaning that `this.offset` would be greater than `0` even if it was originally `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would increment `this.offset` by `1`, meaning that it would be equal to `0` even if it was originally a non-zero value.

DONE.
