  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and if it is not present, the `stringify` function will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not always present in the `options` object, and if it is not present, the `JSON.parse` function will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not always present in the `options` object, and if it is not present, the `JSON.parse` function will throw an error.

DONE.
