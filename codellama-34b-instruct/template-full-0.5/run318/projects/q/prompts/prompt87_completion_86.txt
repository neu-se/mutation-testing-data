  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the function `f`, which would change its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the function `f` by 2, which would change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract 1 from the function `f`, which would change its behavior.

DONE.
