  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `rejected` callback to be called instead of the `fulfilled` callback when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, null
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `null` is added to the end of the argument list, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with an additional argument that is not expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `undefined` is added to the end of the argument list, which would cause the `progress` callback to be called with an additional argument that is not expected.

DONE.
