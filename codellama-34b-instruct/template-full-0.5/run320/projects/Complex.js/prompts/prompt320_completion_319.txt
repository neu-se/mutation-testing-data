  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which would result in a different value for `d` and potentially different results for the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which would result in a different value for `d` and potentially different results for the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * b`, which would result in a different value for `d` and potentially different results for the rest of the function.

DONE.
