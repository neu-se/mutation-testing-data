  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite. Using `isNaN` would cause the `inverse` method to return `Complex['ZERO']` when the input is a NaN value, which is incorrect.

DONE.
