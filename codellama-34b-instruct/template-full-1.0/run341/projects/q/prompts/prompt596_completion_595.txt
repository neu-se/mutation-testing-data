  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch(deferred.reject, op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `self.promiseDispatch`, the `deferred.reject` function is called instead of the `deferred.resolve` function, causing the promise to reject instead of resolve.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because using `args.slice()` creates a new array from the `args` array, which could potentially have different contents than the original `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"" + self, args
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating `self` and `args` to an empty string causes them to be coerced to strings, which could potentially result in different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
