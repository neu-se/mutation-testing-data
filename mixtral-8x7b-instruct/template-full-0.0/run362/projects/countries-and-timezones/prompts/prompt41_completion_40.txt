 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is falsy, it will return an empty object instead of the original behavior of skipping that key-value pair in the resulting object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is falsy, it will omit that key-value pair in the resulting object, whereas the original code would still include it with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ id }
```
This would result in different behavior because it only returns the `id` property of the country object, whereas the original code returns the entire country object.

DONE.
