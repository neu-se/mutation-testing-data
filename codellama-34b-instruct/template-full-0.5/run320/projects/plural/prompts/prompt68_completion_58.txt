  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'meme'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid plural form for the word "memo", while the new code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid plural form for the word "memo", while the new code fragment is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a valid plural form for the word "memo", while the new code fragment is not.

DONE.
