Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `done` method to not handle progress notifications at all, effectively ignoring any progress callbacks that were provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would lead to the same outcome as using `null`, where the progress callback is ignored, but it may also introduce confusion regarding the intended use of the `progress` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the expected progress handler with a string, which would not be a valid function, leading to a runtime error when the `done` method attempts to call it as a function.

DONE.
