  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `verbs` is the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(verb => verb !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.filter(verb => verb !== 'GET')` filters out the verb 'GET' from the array, whereas `verbs` contains all the verbs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(verb => verb.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.map(verb => verb.toUpperCase())` converts all the verbs to uppercase, whereas `verbs` contains the verbs in their original case.

DONE.
