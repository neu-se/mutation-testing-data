  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator is replaced with the decrement operator, causing the loop to iterate one less time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator is replaced with an addition assignment operator, causing the loop to iterate two less times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the increment operator is replaced with an addition assignment operator, causing the loop to iterate one less time.

DONE.
