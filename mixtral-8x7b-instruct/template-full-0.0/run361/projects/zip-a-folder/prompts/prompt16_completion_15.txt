 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
fs.access
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.access` does not return a promise, unlike `fs.promises.access`. This change would cause the `await` keyword to throw a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
fs.promises.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.accessSync` is an asynchronous function, while `fs.promises.access` is a synchronous function. This change would cause the code to block the event loop, which could lead to performance issues or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
fs.promises.stat
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.promises.stat` returns information about a file or directory, while `fs.promises.access` only checks if a file or directory exists and is accessible. This change would cause the code to throw a
