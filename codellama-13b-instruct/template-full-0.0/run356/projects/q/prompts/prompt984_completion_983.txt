  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called when the `fail` method of the promise is called, whereas the `deferred.resolve` method is called when the `then` method of the promise is called. This would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which could have unintended consequences in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a new `Error` object as an argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to the `deferred.reject` method. This would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, which could help identify the source of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in
