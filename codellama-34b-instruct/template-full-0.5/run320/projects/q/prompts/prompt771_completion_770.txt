  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled().then(function (states) {
    return states.filter(function (state) {
        return state.status === "fulfilled";
    }).map(function (state) {
        return state.value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out all rejected promises and return only the fulfilled ones, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promises).allSettled().then(function (states) {
    return states.map(function (state) {
        return state.status === "rejected" ? Q.reject(state.reason) : state.value;
    });
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
