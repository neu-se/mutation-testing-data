 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, array
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` (which is equivalent to `undefined`) is being replaced with `null`. In JavaScript, `void 0` is often used to explicitly indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value, whereas `null` is an assignment value. So, using `null` instead of `void 0` might cause unintended side effects in the code that relies on the explicit `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this, array
