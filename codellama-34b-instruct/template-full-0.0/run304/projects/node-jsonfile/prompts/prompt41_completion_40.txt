  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it would not return a promise and would not be compatible with the `universalify.fromPromise` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileAsync` is an asynchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it would return a promise and would be compatible with the `universalify.fromPromise` method. However, it would not have the same behavior as the original code fragment, which is synchronous.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

_writeFile

This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile` is a synchronous version of `_writeFile`, which means it would not return a promise and would not be compatible with the `universalify.fromPromise` method. However, it would have the same behavior as the original
