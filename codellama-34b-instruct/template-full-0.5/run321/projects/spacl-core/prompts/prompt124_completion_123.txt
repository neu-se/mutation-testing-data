  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match even if the path does not match the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match even if the path does not match the regular expression and the match variable is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the rule to match even if the path does not match the regular expression and the match variable is an empty array.

DONE.
