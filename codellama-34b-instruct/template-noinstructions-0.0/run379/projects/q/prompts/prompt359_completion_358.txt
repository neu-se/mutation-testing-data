  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value passed to the `_progressed` function, while the replaced code fragment returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value passed to the `_progressed` function, while the replaced code fragment returns `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value passed to the `_progressed` function, while the replaced code fragment throws an error.

DONE.
