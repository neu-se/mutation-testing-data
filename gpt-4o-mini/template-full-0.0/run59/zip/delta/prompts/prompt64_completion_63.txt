Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly adds the new operation to the end of the `ops` array without merging it with the last operation, potentially leading to a loss of intended operation merging logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the correct position, which could disrupt the order of operations and lead to incorrect results when processing the operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.ops;
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the `ops` array instead of the `Delta` instance itself, breaking the method chaining that is expected from the `insert` method.

DONE.
