  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb + "x"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access a non-existent property on the generator object, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb] = function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the original method with a new function that does nothing, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the original method with the `args` argument, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
