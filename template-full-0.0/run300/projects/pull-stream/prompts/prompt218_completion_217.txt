  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `err` and `cb` to be truthy, while the new code fragment only checks for `cb` to be truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `err` and `cb` to be truthy, while the new code fragment only checks for `err` to be truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `err` and `cb` to be truthy, while the new code fragment only checks for `err` to be truthy and `cb` to be undefined.

DONE.
