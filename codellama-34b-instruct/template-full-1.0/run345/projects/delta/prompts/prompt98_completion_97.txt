  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  newOp.insert = "123";
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the `arg` parameter to determine the value of `newOp.insert`, while this new code fragment would always set it to the string `"123"`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  newOp.attributes = { name: "hello" };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the `attributes` parameter to determine the value of `newOp.attributes`, while this new code fragment would always set it to the object `{ name: "hello" }`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  newOp.retain = 456;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the `length` parameter to determine the value of `newOp.retain`, while this new code fragment would always set it to the number `456`.
