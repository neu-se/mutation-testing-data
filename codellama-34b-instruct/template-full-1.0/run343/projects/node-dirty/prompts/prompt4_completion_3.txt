  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete()` removes a specific key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because setting a value to `undefined` would update the map, while `delete()` would remove the key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would update the size of the map to 0, while `delete()` would remove a specific key-value pair and update the size accordingly.

DONE.
