  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be one character shorter than the original substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be one character longer than the original substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting substring would be the same length as the original substring.

DONE.
