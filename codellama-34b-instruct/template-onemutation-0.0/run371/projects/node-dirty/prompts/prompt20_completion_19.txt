  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._flush` is a function that flushes the queue of pending writes to the database file, but `this._flush(key)` would attempt to call a function named `key` which is not defined. This would cause an error and the test would fail.

DONE.
