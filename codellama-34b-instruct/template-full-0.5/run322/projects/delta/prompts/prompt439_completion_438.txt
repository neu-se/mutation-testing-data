  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null && nextOp.retain.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `retain` property is an object with a non-zero length, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null && nextOp.retain.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `retain` property is an object with a length of 1, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null && nextOp.retain.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the `retain` property is an object
