  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` function would be called with an empty object as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
