  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, while `nodeArgs` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat([1, 2, 3])` would add the elements `1`, `2`, and `3` to the end of the `nodeArgs` array, while `nodeArgs` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })` would remove any elements from the `nodeArgs` array that are equal to `1`, while `nodeArgs` would return the original array.
