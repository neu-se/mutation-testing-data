Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/([^\S]+|[()[\]{}'"]|\b)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\r\n` characters are removed from the regular expression, which would cause the function to treat newline characters as word characters instead of splitting on them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/([^\S\r\n]+|[()[\]{}'"\n]|\b)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\r` character is removed from the regular expression, which would cause the function to treat carriage return characters as word characters instead of splitting on them, potentially leading to incorrect results on Windows systems.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/([^\S\r\n]+|[()[\]{}"]|\b)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the single quote character is removed from the regular expression, which would cause the function to treat single quotes as word characters instead of splitting on them, potentially leading to incorrect results when comparing strings with quoted text.

DONE.
