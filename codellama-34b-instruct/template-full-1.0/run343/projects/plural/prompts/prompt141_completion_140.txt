  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the whole rule instead of just the word to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
("some other word")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different word to the function, causing a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of a word, causing a null pointer exception.

DONE.
