  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2rad(φ1)` would return the radian value of `φ1`, which is not the same as `φ1` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg(φ1)` would return the degree value of `φ1`, which is not the same as `φ1` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1 * Math.PI / 180` would return the radian value of `φ1`, which is not the same as `φ1` itself.

DONE.
