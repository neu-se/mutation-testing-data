  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(p => p.name !== undefined).map(p => [p.name, p])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any policies with an undefined `name` property, which could cause the `map` method to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(p => [p.name, p]).filter(p => p.name !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any policies with an undefined `name` property, which could cause the `map` method to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(p => [p.name, p]).filter(p => p.name !== undefined).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method would reverse the order of the policies, which could cause the `map` method to
