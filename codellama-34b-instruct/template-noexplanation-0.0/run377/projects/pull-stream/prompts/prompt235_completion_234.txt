  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This change will cause the function to return immediately, without calling the `next` function. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the function when it is called with invalid arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid argument')
```
This change will cause the function to throw an error when it is called with an invalid argument. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the function when it is called with unexpected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return next(end, cb)
```
This change will cause the function to return the result of calling the `next` function with the same arguments. This can be useful for testing the behavior of the function when it is called with valid arguments.

DONE.
