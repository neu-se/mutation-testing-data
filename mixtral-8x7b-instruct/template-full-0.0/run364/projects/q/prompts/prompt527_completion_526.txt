 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `dispatch` to receive `null` as the first argument instead of the expected `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object, 'notAnOperator', args
