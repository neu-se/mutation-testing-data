  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` takes a callback function as its first argument, while `array_slice` takes a start and end index as its first two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `array_slice` returns a new array with the elements at specified start and end indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value, while `array_slice` returns a new array with the elements at specified start and end indices.

DONE.
