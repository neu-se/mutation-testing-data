  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one more time, and the `flush` function would be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute two more times, and the `flush` function would be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
4
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute three more times, and the `flush` function would be called with a different argument.

DONE.
