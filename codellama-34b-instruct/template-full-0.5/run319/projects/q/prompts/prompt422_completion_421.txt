  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` would return `true` for `null`, whereas it would return `false` for `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` would return `false` for `undefined`, whereas it would return `true` for `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"object"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` would return `false` for a string, whereas it would return `true` for an object.

DONE.
