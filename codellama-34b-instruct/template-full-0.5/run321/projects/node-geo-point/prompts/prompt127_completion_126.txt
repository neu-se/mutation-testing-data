  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a GeoPoint object, but `undefined` is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a GeoPoint object, but `null` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a GeoPoint object with non-zero latitude and longitude values, but `new GeoPoint(0, 0)` creates a GeoPoint object with zero latitude and longitude values.

DONE.
