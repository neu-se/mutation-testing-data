  Option 1: The PLATEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'metallic'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "memo" would be replaced with "metallic", resulting in a nonsensical plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'dance'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "memo" would be replaced with "dance", resulting in a nonsensical plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "memo" would be replaced with an empty string, resulting in the original string being lost.

DONE.
