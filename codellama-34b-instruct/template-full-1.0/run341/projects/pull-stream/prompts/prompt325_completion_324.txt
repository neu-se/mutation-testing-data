  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end == true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `end` is truthy, while this code fragment is checking whether it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `end` is truthy, while this code fragment is checking whether it is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `end` is truthy, while this code fragment is checking whether it is falsy.

DONE.
