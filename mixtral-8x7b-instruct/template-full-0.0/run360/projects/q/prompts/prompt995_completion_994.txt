 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.makeNodeResolver()();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is immediately invoked, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected before the Node.js-style callback is added to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is directly resolved, bypassing the Node.js-style callback and the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(new Error("Forced rejection"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is immediately rejected with an error, bypassing the Node.js-style callback and the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
