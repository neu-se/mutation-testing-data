  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the actual stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the stack trace, which would likely be different from the index of the first newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 2 to the result of the original code, which would change the position of the first newline character in the stack trace.

DONE.
