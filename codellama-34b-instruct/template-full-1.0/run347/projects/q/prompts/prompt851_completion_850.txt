  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a `Promise` method, while `deferred.reject` is a function of the `deferred` library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a `Q` method, while `deferred.reject` is a function of the `deferred` library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is used to resolve a promise, while `deferred.reject` is used to reject a promise.

DONE.
