  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array with the same elements as `cbs`, whereas `cbs` itself is a reference to the original array. If the `cbs` array is modified after it is passed to the `set` method, the changes will not be reflected in the new array created by `cbs.slice()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat([])` creates a new array with the same elements as `cbs`, followed by an empty array. This means that the new array will have one more element than `cbs`, which could cause the `set` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(() => true)` creates a new array with the same
