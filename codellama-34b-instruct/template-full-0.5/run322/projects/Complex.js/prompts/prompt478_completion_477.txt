  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` is a function that checks if a value is `NaN`, while `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is not finite, while `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 - isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is not finite, while `isFinite` is a function that checks if a value is finite.

DONE.
