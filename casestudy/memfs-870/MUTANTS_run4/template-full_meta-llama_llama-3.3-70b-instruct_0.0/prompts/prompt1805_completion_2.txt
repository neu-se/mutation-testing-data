Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for writing instead of reading, potentially causing issues if the file does not exist or if the intention is to read from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'wx'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for exclusive writing, which means that if the file already exists, the operation would fail, whereas the original code would allow reading from an existing file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for appending, which means that any writes would be appended to the end of the file instead of overwriting the existing contents, potentially causing issues if the intention is to read from the file or overwrite its contents.

DONE.
