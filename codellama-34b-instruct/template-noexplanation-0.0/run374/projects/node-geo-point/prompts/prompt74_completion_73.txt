  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 360 to the result of the `rad2deg` function, which is used to convert radians to degrees. This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) - 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it subtracts 360 from the result of the `rad2deg` function, which is used to convert radians to degrees. This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it multiplies the result of the `rad2deg` function by 2,
