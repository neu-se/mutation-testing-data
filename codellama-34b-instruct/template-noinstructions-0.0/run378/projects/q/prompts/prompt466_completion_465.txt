  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the code is checking if `atReport` is equal to -1, so using `===` instead of `!==` would result in the opposite behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand, while the `!==` operator checks for inequality. In this case, the code is checking if `atReport` is greater than or equal to 0, so using `>=` instead of `!==` would result in the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks if the left operand is less than the right oper
