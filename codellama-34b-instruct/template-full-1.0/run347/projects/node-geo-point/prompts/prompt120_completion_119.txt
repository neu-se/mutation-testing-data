  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance - bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus operator would negate the value of `bearing`, causing the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point based on a different bearing than what was passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, distance + 1, bearing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `distance` argument would be increased by 1, causing the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point a distance greater than what was passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, bearing / 2, distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` argument would be divided by 2, causing the `calculateDestination` method to calculate the destination point based on a bearing that is half the value of what was passed in.

DONE.
