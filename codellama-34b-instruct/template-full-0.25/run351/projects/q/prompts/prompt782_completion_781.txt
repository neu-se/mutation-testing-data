  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called three times instead of twice, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop, noop, noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` function would be called three times instead of twice, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, which would be caught by the `when` function and turned into a rejection.

DONE.
