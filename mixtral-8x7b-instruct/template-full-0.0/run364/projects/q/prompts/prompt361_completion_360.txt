 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved promise would be rejected instead, causing the chained `.then` to trigger the rejected handler instead of the fulfilled handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve the promise of the deferred object, which is not a function and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(deferred.resolve, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the `deferred.resolve` call in a `setTimeout` with a delay of 0, which would schedule the call to be executed in the next event loop tick. This could cause race conditions and unexpected behavior in the promise chain.

DONE.
