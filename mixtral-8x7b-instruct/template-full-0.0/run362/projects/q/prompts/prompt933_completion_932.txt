 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `args` array. If any modifications are made to the `args` array after this line, the changes will not be reflected in the `nodeArgs` array, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[...args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array using the spread operator, which does not refer to the original `args` array. Similar to the first option, any modifications made to the `args` array after this line will not be reflected in the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign([], args)
