  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```promised.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `promised.length` would always return `undefined`, whereas the original code `progressed` would return the value of the `progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promised.call(this, resolvedValue)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promised.call(this, resolvedValue)` would return the result of `promised.call(this, resolvedValue)`, whereas the original code `progressed` would return the value of the `progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promised[resolvedValue]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promised[resolvedValue]` would always return `undefined`, whereas the original code `progressed` would return the value of the `progressed` function.

DONE.
