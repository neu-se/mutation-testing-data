  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error, as `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error, as `undefined` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}.push
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())` line to throw an error, as `{}` is an object and does not have a `push` method.

DONE.
