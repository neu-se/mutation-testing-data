  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is a variable that is assigned the result of `fs.readFileSync()`, while `content` is never assigned a value. Therefore, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `data`, the `JSON.parse()` method will receive the result of `fs.readFileSync()` as its first argument, which may not be a string and may cause the method to throw an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj` is a variable that is assigned the value returned by `JSON.parse()`, while `content` is never assigned a value. Therefore, if the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `obj`, the `JSON.parse()` method will receive the value returned by `JSON.parse()` as its first argument, which may not be a string and may cause the method to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str
```
