  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/i` flag is missing from the end of the pattern, which would cause the regex to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/g` flag is added to the end of the pattern, which would cause the regex to match all occurrences of "s" in the input string, not just the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|(s)$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/gi` flag is added to the end of the pattern, which would cause the regex to be case-insensitive and match all occurrences of "s" in the input string. The parentheses around "s" also capture the matched "s" in a group, which is not present in the original
