 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://localhost'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a specific base URL instead of using the existing `baseUrlStr` variable. This could cause issues if the code expects to use the original base URL provided by the user.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the base URL entirely. This could cause issues if the code relies on having a base URL for relative URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'https://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets a hardcoded protocol and domain, which could cause issues if the original `baseUrlStr` variable had a different protocol or domain.

DONE.
