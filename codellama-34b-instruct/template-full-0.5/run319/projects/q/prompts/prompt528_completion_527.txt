  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).all` returns a promise for an array of values, whereas `Q(object).inspect` returns a promise for an object with information about the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).keys` returns a promise for an array of property names, whereas `Q(object).inspect` returns a promise for an object with information about the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).values` returns a promise for an array of property values, whereas `Q(object).inspect` returns a promise for an object with information about the object.

DONE.
