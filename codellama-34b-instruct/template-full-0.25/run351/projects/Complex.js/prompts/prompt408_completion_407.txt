  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `temp` variable, which is a `Complex` object, and the new code fragment adds 1 to it, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `temp` variable, which is a `Complex` object, and the new code fragment multiplies it by 2, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
temp.re
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `temp` variable, which is a `Complex` object, and the new code fragment accesses its `re` property, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
