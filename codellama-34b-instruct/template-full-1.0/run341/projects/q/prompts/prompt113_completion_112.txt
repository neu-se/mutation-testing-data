  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` and `apply` have different ways of handling function context and arguments. `call` expects a context object as the first argument, while `apply` expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a different function object than `callback`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return callback.call(this, arguments); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function call to be the current context, rather than the `this` value passed to `callback`.

DONE.
