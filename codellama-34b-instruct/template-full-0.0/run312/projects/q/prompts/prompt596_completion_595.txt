  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument of the `args` array, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], self
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `args` array as the first argument to the `callback` function, and `self` as the second argument, instead of passing `self` as the first argument and `args` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0], args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first two elements of the `args` array as arguments to the `callback` function, instead of passing the entire `args` array.

DONE.
