  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of at least 1, even if the next operation is a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length of at most 1 less than the actual length, even if the next operation is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a length that is twice the actual length, even if the next operation is a retain.

DONE.
