  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only gets the "head" property of the promise, while this new code fragment gets the "tail" property instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").then(function(value) { return value.tail; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only gets the "head" property of the promise, while this new code fragment gets the "tail" property of the "head" property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").then(function(value) { return value.head; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only gets the "head" property of the promise, while this new code fragment gets the "head" property of the "tail" property.

DONE.
