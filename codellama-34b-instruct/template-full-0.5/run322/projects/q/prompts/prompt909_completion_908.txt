  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a resolved promise with the value `2`, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a rejected promise with the value `-1`, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return a resolved promise with the value `"foo"`, regardless of the input arguments.

DONE.
