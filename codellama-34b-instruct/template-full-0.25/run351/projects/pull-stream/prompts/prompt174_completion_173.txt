  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length` property would be incremented by 1, causing the `i >= array.length` condition to always be false, resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length` property would be decremented by 1, causing the `i >= array.length` condition to always be true, resulting in the function returning `true` immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length` property would be multiplied by 2, causing the `i >= array.length` condition to be true only when `i` is greater than half the length of the array, resulting in the function returning `true` only for half the elements in the array.

DONE.
