  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buffer.slice"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a substring of `buffer` starting from the first occurrence of the specified separator, whereas `buffer.split` returns an array of substrings split by the specified separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buffer.reverse()"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the characters in `buffer`, whereas `buffer.split` would not affect the order of the characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buffer.split('foo')"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split `buffer` into substrings using "foo" as the separator, whereas the original code fragment would split the buffer into substrings using the newline character as the separator.

DONE.
