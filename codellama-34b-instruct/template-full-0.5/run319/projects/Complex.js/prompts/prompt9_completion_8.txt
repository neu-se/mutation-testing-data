  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` are different functions and would produce different results for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `x => x + 1` is not the same as `Math.exp`. The former would add 1 to the input, while the latter would compute the exponential function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `x => x * 2` is not the same as `Math.exp`. The former would double the input, while the latter would compute the exponential function.

DONE.
