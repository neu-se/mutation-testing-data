 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is not the same as calling `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`. The `makeNodeResolver` method returns an object with `resolve` and `reject` functions, which are used to resolve or reject the deferred promise. By replacing it with an empty object, the promise will never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and cannot be used to resolve or reject the deferred promise. This would cause the promise to remain in a pending state indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a function that always returns `true`, which is not the same as calling `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`. The `makeNodeResolver` method returns an
