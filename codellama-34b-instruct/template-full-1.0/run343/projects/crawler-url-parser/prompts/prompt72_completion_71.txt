  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').val
```
This would result in different behavior because `.val()` is used to get the value of a form element, rather than `.attr()` which is used to get the attribute of an element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base > href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` element that is a direct child of the `base` element, rather than the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the `href` attribute of the `base` element, but with a different selector than the original code.

DONE.
