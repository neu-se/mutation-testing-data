  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cell', 'cells'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would correctly inflect the word "cello" to "cellos", but the modified fragment would incorrectly inflect it to "cells".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellobomb', 'cellobombs'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would correctly inflect the word "cello" to "cellos", but the modified fragment would incorrectly inflect the word "cellobomb" to "cellobombs".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'celloglyph', 'celloglyphs'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would correctly inflect the word "cello" to "cellos", but the modified fragment would incorrectly inflect the word "celloglyph" to "celloglyphs".

DONE.
