  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called when the promise is rejected, while `deferred.resolve` is called when the promise is resolved. By replacing `deferred.reject` with `deferred.resolve`, the promise will be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with a new `Error` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message. By replacing `deferred.reject` with `deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))`, the promise will be rejected with a specific error message, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(null)
```
