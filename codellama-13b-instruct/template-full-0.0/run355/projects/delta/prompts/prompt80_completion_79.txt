  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if `lastOp` is undefined, whereas the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator to check if `lastOp` is not an object. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `lastOp` is undefined, which could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used to check if `lastOp` is null, whereas the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator to check if `lastOp` is not an object. This change would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `lastOp` is null, which could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `
