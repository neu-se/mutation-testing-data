 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass a blank string to the `policy.query` method instead of the actual `path` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `path` property of the `PolicyMap` class, which does not exist, instead of using the `path` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `path` property of the `ctx` object, if it exists, instead of the `path` variable. If the `ctx` object does not have a `path` property, it would result in `undefined` being passed to the `policy.query` method.

DONE.
