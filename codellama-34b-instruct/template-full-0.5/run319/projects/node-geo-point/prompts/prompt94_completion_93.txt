  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` is the inverse sine function, which returns the angle in radians whose sine is `sinφ2`. In the original code, `asin` is used to calculate the latitude of the destination point, but using `asin(sinφ2)` would result in a different latitude value, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` is the inverse cosine function, which returns the angle in radians whose cosine is `sinφ2`. In the original code, `acos` is used to calculate the longitude of the destination point, but using `acos(sinφ2)` would result in a different longitude value, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(sinφ2,
