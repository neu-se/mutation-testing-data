  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the function to return the opposite result of the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) && true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& true` expression is added, which would cause the function to always return `true`, regardless of the result of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || false }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| false` expression is added, which would cause the function to always return `false`, regardless of the result of the `test` function.

DONE.
