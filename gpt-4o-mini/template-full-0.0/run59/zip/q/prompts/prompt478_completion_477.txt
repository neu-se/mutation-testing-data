Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the element at the index `at`, potentially leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the next element in the `unhandledRejections` array instead of the intended element at index `at`, which could cause mismatches in the tracking of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the last element of the `unhandledRejections` array, regardless of which promise was actually being untracked, leading to incorrect state management.

DONE.
