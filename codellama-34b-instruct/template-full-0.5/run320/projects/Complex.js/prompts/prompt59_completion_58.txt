  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is finite, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is finite, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is finite, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to itself.

DONE.
