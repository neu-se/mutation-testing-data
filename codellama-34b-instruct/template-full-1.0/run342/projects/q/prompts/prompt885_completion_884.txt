  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the setTimeout function would be called with a different delay value, potentially causing the promise to be resolved or rejected at a different time than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 50
```
This would result in different behavior because the setTimeout function would be called with a shorter delay value, potentially causing the promise to be resolved or rejected earlier than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the setTimeout function would be called with a random delay value, potentially causing the promise to be resolved or rejected at a different time than expected.

DONE.
