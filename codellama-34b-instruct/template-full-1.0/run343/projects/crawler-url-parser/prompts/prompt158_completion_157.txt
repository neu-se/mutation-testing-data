  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\w+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the last path component of the URL, whereas the original regular expression matches the last path component only if it does not contain a `/`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(.*)\/(.*)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that ends with a `/` followed by any number of characters, whereas the original regular expression matches only the last path component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\w+([^/]+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that ends with a word character followed by any number of non-`/` characters, whereas the original regular expression matches only the last path component.

DONE.
