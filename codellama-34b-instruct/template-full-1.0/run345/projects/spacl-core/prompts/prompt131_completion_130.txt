  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while `!=` checks for loose inequality. In this case, the `!==` operator would cause the code to behave differently if the value of `prop` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the check for `prop === undefined`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value of `prop` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logical operator `||` to `&&`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value of `prop` is `undefined`.

DONE.
