 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the approximate reciprocal of the radians-to-degrees conversion, instead of the actual conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the result of atan(PI/2) instead of converting radians to degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the longitude of the coordinate instead of converting radians to degrees.

DONE.
