  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is a function that returns the opposite of `ses.ok`, which means that if the original code fragment was expecting `ses.ok` to return `true`, the mutated code would return `false` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ok === true` is a boolean expression that always evaluates to `true`, regardless of the value of `ses.ok`. This would cause the code to always enter the `if` block, even if `ses.ok` was originally `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.ok !== true` is a boolean expression that always evaluates to `false`, regardless of the value of `ses.ok`. This would
