  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cosh` are different functions, and using `sin` instead of `cosh` would cause the result of the `Complex` constructor to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different function than `cosh`, and using `Math.sin` instead of `cosh` would cause the result of the `Complex` constructor to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different expression than `cosh`, and using `a * b` instead of `cosh` would cause the result of the `Complex` constructor to be different.

DONE.
