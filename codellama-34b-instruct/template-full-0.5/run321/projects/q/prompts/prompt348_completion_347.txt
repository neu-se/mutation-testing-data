  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception, self);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` argument is not present in the original code, which would cause the `reject` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a different error object than the one that was originally thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with the same error object as the original code, but the `self` argument would be missing, which could cause the `reject` function to behave differently.

DONE.
