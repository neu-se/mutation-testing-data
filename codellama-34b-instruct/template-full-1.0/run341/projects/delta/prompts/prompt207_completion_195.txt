  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp` object is being used as a placeholder in the original code fragment, and replacing it with null would cause the code to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deleteOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `deleteOp` is a different variable from `otherOp`, and using it instead would change the meaning of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp` is a different variable from `otherOp`, and using it instead would change the meaning of the code.

DONE.
