  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects to receive data, and the modified code would return null instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects to receive data, and the modified code would return an empty string instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects to receive data, and the modified code would return an error object instead.

DONE.
