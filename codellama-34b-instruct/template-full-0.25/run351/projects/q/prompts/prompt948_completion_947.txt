  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.fapply` to call the callback, which ensures that the callback is called with the correct context and arguments. Replacing it with `apply` would result in the callback being called with the wrong context and arguments, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.call(thisp, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.fapply` to call the callback, which ensures that the callback is called with the correct context and arguments. Replacing it with `call` would result in the callback being called with the wrong context and arguments, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.bind(thisp)(arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.fapply` to call the callback,
