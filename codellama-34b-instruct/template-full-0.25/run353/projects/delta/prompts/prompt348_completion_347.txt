  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of `baseOpData`, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all but the first element of `baseOpData`, rather than just the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the elements of `baseOpData` in reverse order, rather than the original order.

DONE.
