  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, op) => acc + op.insert, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method reduces an array to a single value, while the `map` method returns a new array containing the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach(op => console.log(op.insert))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` method executes a provided function once per array element, while the `map` method returns a new array containing the results
