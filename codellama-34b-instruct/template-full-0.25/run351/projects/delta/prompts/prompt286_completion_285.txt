  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be incremented by 1, which could cause the code to skip over the first character of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable would be used instead of `start`, which could cause the code to start at a different position in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `start` variable would be decremented by 1, which could cause the code to start at a different position in the string.

DONE.
