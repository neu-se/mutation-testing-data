  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_hasOwnProperty` is a different function than `object_toString`, and would likely cause the `isStopIteration` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` is a different function than `object_toString`, and would likely cause the `isStopIteration` function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"[object StopIteration]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string literal `"[object StopIteration]"` is different from the function `object_toString`, and would likely cause the `isStopIteration` function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
