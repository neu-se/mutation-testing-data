  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `otherOp.insert` value instead of the `otherOp` value, which could be a different object or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `otherOp.delete` value instead of the `otherOp` value, which could be a different object or value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `thisOp.retain` value instead of the `otherOp` value, which could be a different object or value.

DONE.
