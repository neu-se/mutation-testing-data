  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'write_close'` event without any arguments, while this modified code emits the `'write_close'` event with an `'error'` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'write_close'` event without any arguments, while this modified code emits the `'write_close'` event with a `'drain'` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close', 'end');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'write_close'` event without any arguments, while this modified code emits the `'write_close'` event with an `'end'` argument.

DONE.
