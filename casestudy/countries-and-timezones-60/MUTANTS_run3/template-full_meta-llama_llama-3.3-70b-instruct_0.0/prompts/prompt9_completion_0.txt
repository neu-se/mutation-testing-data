Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.floor` rounds down, potentially changing the calculated hours in the `getOffsetStr` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
offset => Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Math.round` to round the result to the nearest integer, which could produce different results than `Math.floor` for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` truncates the decimal part, similar to `Math.floor` for positive numbers but similar to `Math.ceil` for negative numbers, which could lead to different results in certain cases.

DONE.
