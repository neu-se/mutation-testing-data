  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because `arg` is a different property than `phi`, and the code that uses `phi` is not expecting to receive `arg` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because `abs` is a different property than `phi`, and the code that uses `phi` is not expecting to receive `abs` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because `re` is a different property than `phi`, and the code that uses `phi` is not expecting to receive `re` instead.

DONE.
