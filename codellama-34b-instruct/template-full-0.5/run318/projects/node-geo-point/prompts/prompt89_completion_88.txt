  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is missing a multiplication operator before the `cos(φ2)` term, which would result in a different calculation of the `y` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) - cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is missing a multiplication operator before the `cos(φ2)` term, which would result in a different calculation of the `y` variable.
