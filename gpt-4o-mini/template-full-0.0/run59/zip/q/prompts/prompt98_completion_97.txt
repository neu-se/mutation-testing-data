Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the index by 2 instead of 1, potentially skipping every other element in the array during the reduction process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the index instead of incrementing it, which could lead to an infinite loop or accessing invalid array indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index = length
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the index to the length of the array, effectively terminating the loop immediately and preventing any reduction from occurring.

DONE.
