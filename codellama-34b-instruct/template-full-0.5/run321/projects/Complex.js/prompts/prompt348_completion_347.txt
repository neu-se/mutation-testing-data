  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator would cause the argument to be inverted, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be increased by 1, resulting in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument would be doubled, resulting in a different value.

DONE.
