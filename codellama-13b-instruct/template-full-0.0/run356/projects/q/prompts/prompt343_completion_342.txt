  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function would be called instead of the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(fulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` function would be called on the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the `fulfilled` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(fulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.when` function would be called on the `fulfilled` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the `fulfilled` function.

DONE.
