  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `true` for the string `"//"` which is not a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\*\*\*/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `true` for the string `"**"` which is not a valid wildcard.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/napshot/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method would return `true` for the string `"snapshot"` which is not a valid pattern.

DONE.
