  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, but the `state` property is not a function, so it cannot be called with the parentheses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state !== "pending";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, but the `state` property is not a function, so it cannot be called with the parentheses.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.inspect().state === "fulfilled";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with information about the promise's state, but the `state` property is not a function, so it cannot be called with the parentheses.

DONE.
