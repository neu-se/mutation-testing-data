 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(result.value) === "[object Promise]"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `result.value` is a promise using `Object.prototype.toString` instead of the original `instanceof` check. This might not produce the same result as the original code, especially when dealing with promises from different libraries or in different iframes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value && (result.value.constructor === Promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `result.value` is an instance of the local `Promise` constructor, which may not be the same as the original `Promise` constructor if the code is minified or concatenated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof result.value.then === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `result.value` has a `then` method, which
