  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is exactly `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not exactly `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof mapper !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not a function.

DONE.
