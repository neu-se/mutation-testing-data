  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return an empty object, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return the sum of the input objects, rather than the difference between them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return the difference between the input objects, rather than the sum.

DONE.
