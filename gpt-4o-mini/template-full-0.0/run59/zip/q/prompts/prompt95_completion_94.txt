Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++ > length
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the incremented index is greater than the length, which could lead to an off-by-one error, causing the loop to potentially skip valid elements or access out-of-bounds indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the index is at the last valid position instead of exceeding the length, which could cause the loop to terminate prematurely and miss processing the last element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional valid index, allowing the loop to attempt to access an index that is out of bounds, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when trying to access elements that do not exist.

DONE.
