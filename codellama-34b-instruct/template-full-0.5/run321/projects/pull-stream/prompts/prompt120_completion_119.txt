  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : acc
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `end` variable is checked for strict equality with `true`, and if it is, `null` is returned. In the mutated code, `acc` is returned instead, which could cause the function to return a different value than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false ? null : end
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `end` variable is checked for strict equality with `true`, and if it is, `null` is returned. In the mutated code, `end` is checked for strict equality with `false`, and if it is, `null` is returned. This could cause the function to return a different value than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
