  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point, this
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer receive the `point` argument, which could cause it to return a different value or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would receive a null value as the `point` argument, which could cause it to return a different value or throw an error.

DONE.
