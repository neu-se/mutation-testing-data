  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the real part of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the argument (angle) of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

DONE.
