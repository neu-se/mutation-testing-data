  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp == null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp` is null, the conditional statement would evaluate to true, whereas in the original code it would evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp.retain` is negative, the conditional statement would evaluate to true, whereas in the original code it would evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because if `lastOp.retain` is falsey, the conditional statement would evaluate to true, whereas in the original code it would evaluate to false.

DONE.
