  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `rejected` is a function, while this replacement checks if `rejected` is not null. If `rejected` is a function, this replacement would still evaluate to true, but if `rejected` is null, the replacement would evaluate to false, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rejected !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `rejected` is a function, while this replacement checks if `rejected` is not undefined. If `rejected` is a function, this replacement would still evaluate to true, but if `rejected` is undefined, the replacement would evaluate to false, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected !== void 0
```
This would result in
