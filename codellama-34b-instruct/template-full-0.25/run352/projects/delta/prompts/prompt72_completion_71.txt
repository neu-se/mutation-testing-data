  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `attributes` object, rather than the `attributes` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `attributes` object, rather than the `attributes` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the `attributes` object except the first one, rather than the `attributes` object itself.

DONE.
