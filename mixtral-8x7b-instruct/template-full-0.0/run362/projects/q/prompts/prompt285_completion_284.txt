 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with `null` instead of the original value, potentially causing issues in the code that expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Replacement error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with an error object instead of resolving the promise, potentially causing the error handling code to be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
