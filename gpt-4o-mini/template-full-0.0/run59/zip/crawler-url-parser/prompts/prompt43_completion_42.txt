Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the parsing of the base URL to not allow the URL to be resolved correctly, potentially leading to incorrect or null URLs being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression evaluates to `false`, which would prevent the base URL from being parsed correctly, leading to potential failures in URL resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the URL parsing to fail, resulting in an error or unexpected behavior when trying to resolve the current URL against a null base URL.

DONE.
