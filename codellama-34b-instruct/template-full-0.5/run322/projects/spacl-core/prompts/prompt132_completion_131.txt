  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be set to `'GET'`, regardless of the value passed to the `allow` or `deny` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'POST'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be set to `'POST'`, regardless of the value passed to the `allow` or `deny` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = 'PUT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `verb` variable would always be set to `'PUT'`, regardless of the value passed to the `allow` or `deny` methods.

DONE.
