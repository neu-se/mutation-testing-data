  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` is a different value than `1`, and would change the number of arguments passed to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([])` is a different array than `args`, and would change the arguments passed to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof args
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof args` is a different type than `1`, and would change the value of `nodeArgs` passed to the `Q.npost` method.

DONE.
