  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1, otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the code to always prefer the `other` delta, even if the `this` delta has a longer length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1, otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the code to always prefer the `this` delta, even if the `other` delta has a longer length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2, otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the code to always prefer the `this` delta, even if the `other` delta has a longer length.

DONE.
