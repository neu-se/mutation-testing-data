  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the slice of the `ops` array starting from the current index, instead of starting from the first index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice.call(this, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the slice of the `ops` array starting from index 0, instead of starting from the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice.call(this, this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the slice of the `ops` array starting from the current index, instead of starting from the first index.

DONE.
