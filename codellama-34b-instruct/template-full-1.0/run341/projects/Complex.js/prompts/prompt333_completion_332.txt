  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always be executed, even when `b` is not equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always be executed, even when `b` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always be executed, even when `b` is not `NaN`.

DONE.
