  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the complex number is equal to zero, rather than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is not equal to zero, rather than equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the absolute value of the complex number is equal to zero, rather than checking if the imaginary part is equal to zero.

DONE.
