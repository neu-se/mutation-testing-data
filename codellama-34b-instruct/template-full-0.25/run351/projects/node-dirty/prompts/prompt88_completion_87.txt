  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` expects an integer as an argument, but `arr.length - 1` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length - 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove the second-to-last element of the array instead of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop(arr.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would try to remove an element that doesn't exist, causing an error.

DONE.
