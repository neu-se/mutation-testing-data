  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.doesNotMatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotMatch` is a method that checks if a policy does not match a given path, whereas `matches` is a method that checks if a policy matches a given path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that checks if a policy matches a given path, but it does not take a `QueryContext` argument, whereas `matches` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if a policy matches a given path, but it would also check if the policy matches the path with the context inverted, whereas the original code only checks if the policy matches the path with the given context.

DONE.
