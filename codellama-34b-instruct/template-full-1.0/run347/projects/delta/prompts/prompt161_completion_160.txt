  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by `length` steps, rather than just moving to the next element, which could lead to the selection of a different element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter[length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the element at index `length` in the iteration, rather than just moving the iterator to that element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.forEach((op) => op[length].delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `delete` operation to every element in the iteration, rather than just the current element.

DONE.
