  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object is a promise-like object, which may have different behavior than checking if it is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object is not pending, which may result in different behavior than checking if it is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the object is fulfilled, which may result in different behavior than checking if it is a promise.

DONE.
