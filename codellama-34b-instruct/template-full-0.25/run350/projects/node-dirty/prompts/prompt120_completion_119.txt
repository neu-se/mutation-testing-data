  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while the modified code fragment checks if it is greater than 0. This change would cause the `drain` event to be emitted more frequently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the `drain` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while the modified code fragment checks if it is equal to 0. This change would cause the `drain` event to be emitted less frequently, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the `drain` event.
