  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z = new Complex(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the constructor for `Complex` is not being called properly. The `new` keyword is missing, so the code would not create a new instance of `Complex`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z = new Complex(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor expects two parameters, but only one is being provided. The resulting object would not have the correct properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z = new Complex(a, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` constructor expects two parameters, but only one is being provided. The resulting object would not have the correct properties.

DONE.
