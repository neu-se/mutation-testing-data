  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.value` returns the current state of promise, while `inspect` is a function that returns an object with properties `state` and `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected()` is a function that returns an object with properties `state` and `value`, while `inspected.value` is the current state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.reason` returns the reason for the promise being rejected, while `inspected.value` returns the current state of the promise.

DONE.
