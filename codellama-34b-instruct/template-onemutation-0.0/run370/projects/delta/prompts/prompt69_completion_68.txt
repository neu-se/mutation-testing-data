  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length is less than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment only checks if the length is less than 0. This means that the new code fragment would allow negative lengths, which could cause errors in the program.
