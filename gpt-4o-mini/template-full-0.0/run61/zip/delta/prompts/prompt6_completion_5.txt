Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would cause the subsequent logic to not iterate over the correct properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because filtering the keys to only include those that start with 'a' would exclude any other keys, potentially omitting important attributes from the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).map(key => key + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because appending '1' to each key would change the keys being processed, leading to incorrect attribute copying and potentially losing data that should have been included.

DONE.
