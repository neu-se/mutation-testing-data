Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the value of `a['r']`, which could lead to incorrect calculations when converting polar coordinates to rectangular coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `a['r']`, which would incorrectly scale the magnitude of the complex number, leading to erroneous results in subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the value of `a['r']`, potentially resulting in a negative value for the radius, which is not valid in the context of complex number representation.

DONE.
