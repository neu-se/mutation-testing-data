  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) + 1
```
This change will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to always return a different value than the original code, which will likely cause the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) - 1
```
This change will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to always return a different value than the original code, which will likely cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) * 2
```
This change will cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to always return a different value than the original code, which will likely cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
