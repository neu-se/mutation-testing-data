  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` adds the new element at a specific index, whereas `push()` adds it to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the new element at a specific index, whereas `push()` adds it to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[0] = newOp;
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the new element at the beginning of the array, whereas `push()` adds it to the end.

DONE.
