 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
a['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string 'key' as the key instead of the variable `key`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b[key]` instead of `a[key]`. This could lead to incorrect diff results when `b[key]` is not equal to `a[key]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to ignore the key-value pair from the second object, even if it has a different value. This could lead to incorrect diff results when `b[key]` is defined and not equal to `a[key]`.

DONE.
