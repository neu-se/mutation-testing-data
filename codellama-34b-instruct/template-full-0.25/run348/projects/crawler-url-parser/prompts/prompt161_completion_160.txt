  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type, while the new code uses the `===` operator, which checks for equality without converting the operands. This means that the original code would return `true` for `linkurl_without_last_part` and `pageurl_without_last_part` even if they have different types, while the new code would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part !== pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `==` operator, which checks for equality after converting the operands to a common type, while the new code uses the `!==` operator, which checks for inequality without converting the operands. This means that the original code would return `false` for `
