  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be applied to the variable `c`, which is a string, and the number `1`, resulting in a string concatenation instead of a mathematical addition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would be applied to the variable `c`, which is a string, and the number `2`, resulting in a string repetition instead of a mathematical multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/` operator would be applied to the variable `c`, which is a string, and the number `2`, resulting in a string division instead of a mathematical division.

DONE.
