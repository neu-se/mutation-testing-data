  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment checks for greater than. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have more parts than the current page, even if the parts are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment checks for less than. This would cause the function to return "uplevel" for links that have fewer parts than the current page, even if the parts are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality, while this new code fragment checks for inequality. This would cause the function to return "internal" for links that have the same number of parts as the current page
