  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `>=`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a different set of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of `>=`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length = opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator is used instead of `>=`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a different set of values.

DONE.
