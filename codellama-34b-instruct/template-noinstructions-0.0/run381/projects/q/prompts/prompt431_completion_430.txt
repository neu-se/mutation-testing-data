  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` would be bound to the current context, whereas `this.inspect()` would be called immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.call(this)` would call the `inspect` method immediately, whereas `this.inspect()` would return a function that can be called later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect.apply(this)` would call the `inspect` method immediately, whereas `this.inspect()` would return a function that can be called later.

DONE.
