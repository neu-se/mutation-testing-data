  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `aborted` is truthy, but replacing it with `true` would always return `true`, even if `aborted` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `aborted` is truthy, but replacing it with `!aborted` would always return the opposite of `aborted`, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `aborted` is truthy, but replacing it with `aborted || true` would always return `true`, even if `aborted` is falsy, because the `||` operator short-circuits and returns the first truthy value.

DONE.
