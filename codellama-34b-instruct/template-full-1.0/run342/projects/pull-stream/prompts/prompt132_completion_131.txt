  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null, i++` causes `i` to be incremented by 1, while the replacement code fragment `null, i--` causes `i` to be decremented by 1. If a test case expects the `i` variable to be incremented, it would fail if the replacement code fragment is used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null, i++` causes `i` to be incremented by 1, while the replacement code fragment `undefined, i++` causes `i` to be incremented by 2. If a test case expects the `i` variable to be incremented by 1, it would fail if the replacement code fragment is used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the
