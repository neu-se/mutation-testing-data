  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, which is an instance of `OpIterator`.

DONE.
