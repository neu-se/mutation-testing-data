  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1` is a function that calculates `exp(x) - 1`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that calculates `exp(x)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that calculates `exp(x)`, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that calculates `exp(x) - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that calculates `exp(x)`, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that calculates `exp(x) - 1`.

DONE.
