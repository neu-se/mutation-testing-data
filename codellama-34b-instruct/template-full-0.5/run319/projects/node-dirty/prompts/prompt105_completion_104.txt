  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of the `val` property instead of the `key` property, which is likely to cause errors in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(row.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `get` method of the `_data` object instead of the `key` property, which may cause errors if the `get` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + '_'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an underscore to the end of the key, which may cause errors if the code that uses the `Dirty` class expects the key to be in a specific format.

DONE.
