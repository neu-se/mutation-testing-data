  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(thisIter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at the length of the next operation in the other iterator, plus one, rather than the length of the current operation in the this iterator.

DONE.
