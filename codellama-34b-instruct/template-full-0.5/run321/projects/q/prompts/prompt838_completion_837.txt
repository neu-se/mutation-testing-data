  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a null value as the first argument, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {}, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a function as the first argument, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a null value as the second argument, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
