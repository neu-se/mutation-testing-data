  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the string '1' to the end of `src`, rather than accessing a property named '1' on `src`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src['1']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `['1']` syntax would access the property named '1' on `src`, rather than concatenating the string '1' to the end of `src`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would perform addition between `src` and the number 1, rather than concatenating the string '1' to the end of `src`.

DONE.
