 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string 'key' instead of the function argument `key`. This could cause issues if the code expects to use the provided key, but instead uses the string 'key' in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first key in the internal `_data` map instead of the provided key. This could cause issues if the code expects to use the specific key provided as an argument, but instead uses the first key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number instead of using the provided key. This would cause the `update` method to fail, as it expects a key and a function as arguments.

DONE.
