 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` identifier would be re-bound to the global `Math.cos` function, which could lead to different behavior if the code relies on the `cos` variable being a different function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a division operation, which could lead to different behavior if the denominator is zero or very close to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(cos(θ)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce an extra function call to `Math.exp` and `Math.log`, which could lead to different behavior due to rounding errors or differences in the implementation of these functions across different JavaScript engines.

DONE.
