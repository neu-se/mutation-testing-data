  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an empty array, while this code returns an array with a single element, which is the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an empty array, while this code returns a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns an empty array, while this code returns an undefined value.

DONE.
