  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently and reveal any issues with the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This code fragment will always return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently and reveal any issues with the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === Infinity
```
This code fragment will always return `true` if `a` is `Infinity`, which could potentially cause the code to behave differently and reveal any issues with the test suite.

DONE.
