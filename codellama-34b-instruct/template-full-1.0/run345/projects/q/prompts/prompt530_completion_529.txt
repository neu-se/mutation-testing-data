  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejection` is a variable that has not been defined in the provided code, and the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a null value, and the code would not be able to access the necessary methods or properties of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that has a different meaning in the code than `Q` and it would lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
