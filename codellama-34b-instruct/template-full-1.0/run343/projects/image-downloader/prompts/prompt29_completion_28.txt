  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `startsWith()` method to check if the URL starts with "https" (case-insensitive), while the new fragment only checks if the URL starts with "http" (case-sensitive).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `startsWith()` method to check if the URL starts with "https" (case-insensitive), while the new fragment only checks if the URL starts with "https" (case-sensitive).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `startsWith()` method to check if the URL starts with "https" (case-insensitive), while the new fragment only checks if the URL starts with "https://" (case-sensitive).

DONE.
