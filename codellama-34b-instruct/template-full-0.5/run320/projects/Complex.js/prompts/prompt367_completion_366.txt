  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different return values for the same input, which would cause the `tanh` and `coth` functions to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` and `Math.cos` have different return values for the same input, which would cause the `sech` and `csch` functions to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` and `Math.cos` have different return values for the same input, which would cause the `acos` and `acosh` functions to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
