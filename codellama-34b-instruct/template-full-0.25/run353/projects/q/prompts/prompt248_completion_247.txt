  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the stack trace instead of the index of the first newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first newline character minus one, which would result in a different slice of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the last newline character plus one, which would result in a different slice of the stack trace.

DONE.
