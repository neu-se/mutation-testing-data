  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' in row === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key is not present in the row, rather than checking if the key is present but falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the key is not present in the row, rather than checking if the key is present but falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value of the key is undefined, rather than checking if the key is present but falsy.

DONE.
