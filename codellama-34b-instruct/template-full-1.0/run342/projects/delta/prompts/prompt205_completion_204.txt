  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' && typeof thisOp.retain === 'number') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null, while this replacement only checks if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' && typeof thisOp.retain !== 'number') {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null, while this replacement only checks if it is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' && thisOp.retain % 2 === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object
