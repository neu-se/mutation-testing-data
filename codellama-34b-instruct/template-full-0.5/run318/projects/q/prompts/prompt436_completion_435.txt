  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks for the presence of a value in an array, whereas `array_indexOf` checks for the index of a value in an array. If `unhandledRejections` contains a value that is not a promise, `includes` will return `true`, whereas `array_indexOf` will return `-1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in an array, whereas `includes` checks for the presence of a value in an array. If `unhandledRejections` contains a value that is not a promise, `indexOf` will return a value greater than `-1`, whereas `includes` will return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise in unhandledRejections
