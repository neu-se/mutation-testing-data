  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the string "foo" to the src variable, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace("bar", "baz")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the string "bar" with "baz" in the src variable, which would change the directory that is being zipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(",").reverse().join(",")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the src variable, which would change the order of the files that are being zipped.

DONE.
