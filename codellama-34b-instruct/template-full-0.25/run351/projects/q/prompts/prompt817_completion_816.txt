  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `rejected` callback is not called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, and the `progressed` callback is not called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is fulfilled or rejected, and the `null` value is not a valid callback function.

DONE.
