  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of π to the longitude difference would result in a different angle measurement, which would then be used in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of Math.PI to the longitude difference would result in a different angle measurement, which would then be used in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the cosine of the start point's latitude to the longitude difference would result in a different angle measurement, which would then be used in the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
