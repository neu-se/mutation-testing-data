  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `writeFileSync` is a synchronous function that does not have a callback, whereas `writeFile` is an asynchronous function that expects a callback to handle the result. Using `writeFileSync` in this context would cause the program to hang indefinitely, as the callback would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(null, file))
```
This would result in different behavior because using `bind` to bind the `file` argument to the `writeFile` function would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments, resulting in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(function (file, data, callback) {
  fs.writeFile(file, data, callback);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because using a
