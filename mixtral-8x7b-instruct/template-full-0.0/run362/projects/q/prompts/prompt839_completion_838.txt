 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's second argument (rejected handler) expects a function, and `null` is not a function. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's second argument (rejected handler) expects a function, and `42` is not a function. This would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method's second argument (rejected handler) should handle the rejection, but this function always returns `true`, which is not the expected behavior. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

DONE.
