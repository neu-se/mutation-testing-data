  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true`, regardless of the value of `hasStacks`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true` and `hasStacks` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport ? hasStacks : !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `hasStacks` if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true`, and `!hasStacks` if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false`.

DONE.
