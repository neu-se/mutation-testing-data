  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a negative value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that listens to this event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a null value, which could cause errors in the code that listens to this event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a NaN (Not a Number) value, which could cause errors in the code that listens to this event.

DONE.
