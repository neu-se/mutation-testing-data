  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the second element, whereas the original code fragment starts from the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the third element, whereas the original code fragment starts from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return a slice of the `arguments` array starting from the zeroth element, whereas the original code fragment starts from the first element.

DONE.
