  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator increments the value of `this._data.size` by 1, which would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator decrements the value of `this._data.size` by 1, which would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator assigns the value of `0` to `this._data.size`, which would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an incorrect value.

DONE.
