  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to exit early if the `index` is less than 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to continue iterating even if the `index` is greater than or equal to 0, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to skip over the first character of the line if the `index` is greater than 1, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
