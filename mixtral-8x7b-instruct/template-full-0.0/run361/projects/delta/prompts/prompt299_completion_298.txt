 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of a single line, an empty array would be passed to the predicate function, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: 'newline' }
```
This would result in different behavior because a newline character would be passed as the first argument to the predicate function, which might not be handled correctly by the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ insert: '\n\n' }
```
This would result in different behavior because two newline characters would be passed as the first argument to the predicate function, which might not be handled correctly by the predicate function, and could lead to incorrect line handling.

DONE.
