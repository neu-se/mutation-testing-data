  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, which could cause the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, which could cause the loop to terminate too early or to miss certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would multiply `i` by 2 on each iteration, which could cause the loop to terminate too early or to skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
