  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the exception object is not necessarily the same as the exception itself, which could cause the `_rejected` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method of the exception object may return a different string representation than the exception itself, which could cause the `_rejected` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject()` method creates a new promise that is rejected with the given reason, which could cause the `_rejected` function to behave differently.

DONE.
