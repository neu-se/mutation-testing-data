 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for strict equality with `undefined`, which could cause issues if the `cb` variable was defined as `null` or any other falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof cb === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator, which checks the type of the variable, not its value. This could cause issues if the `cb` variable was defined as a non-function value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality with `null`, which could cause issues if the `acc` variable was `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
