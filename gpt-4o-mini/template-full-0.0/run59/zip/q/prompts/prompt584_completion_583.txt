Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as an argument to the `callback` function would cause it to be treated as a valid value, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors in the generator's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a valid initial argument would cause the generator to yield `null`, which may not be the intended behavior and could lead to incorrect handling of the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unexpected value"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `"unexpected value"` would cause the generator to yield a string instead of a promise, which could disrupt the expected flow of asynchronous operations and lead to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
