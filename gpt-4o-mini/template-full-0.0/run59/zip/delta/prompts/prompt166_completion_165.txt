Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always treat the operation as an 'insert', potentially leading to incorrect handling of 'delete' operations and resulting in an incorrect composition of deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain' === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, causing the code to skip the handling of 'delete' operations entirely, which could lead to missing necessary deletions in the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the operation as a 'delete' regardless of the actual operation type, leading to incorrect logic in the composition process and potentially resulting in an invalid delta.

DONE.
