  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, array
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a `void` expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a `void` expression.

DONE.
