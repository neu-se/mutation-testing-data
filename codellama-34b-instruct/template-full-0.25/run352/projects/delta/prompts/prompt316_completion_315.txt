  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method would return a different value, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method would return a different value, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method would return a different value, potentially causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
