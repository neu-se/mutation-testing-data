Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task();
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the `task` function instead of passing it as a reference, which may lead to immediate execution rather than scheduling it for later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform an arithmetic operation on `task`, which is expected to be a function, leading to a type error instead of executing the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing, causing the task to be skipped entirely instead of being executed, which could lead to unhandled promises or missed operations.

DONE.
