  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return reject({});
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not an error, so it would not be caught by the `errback` function and the promise would not be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return reject(function() {
        throw new Error('Error');
    });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a function that throws an error when called, which could result in an uncaught error depending on how the promise is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return reject('Error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a string, which is not an error, so it would not be caught by the `errback` function and the promise would not be rejected.

DONE.
