  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same properties or methods as `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same properties or methods as `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, and it would not have the same properties or methods as `void 0`.

DONE.
