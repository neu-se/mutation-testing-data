  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenResolve` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `thenReject` is a method that returns a promise that is rejected with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(null, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the given value if the promise is fulfilled, or rejected with the given reason if the promise is rejected. In this case, the second argument to `then` is `reason`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that reason if the original promise is fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with
