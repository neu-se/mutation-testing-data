  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a function that takes three arguments, but the original code fragment only passes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a required argument in the original code fragment, but it is not passed in this new code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument `1` is passed to `abortCb`, which may cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
