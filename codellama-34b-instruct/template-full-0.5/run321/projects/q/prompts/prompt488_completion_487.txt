  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resetUnhandledRejections` function, which is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledRejections` array to an empty array, which would not be the desired behavior if the intention is to track unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to `false`, which would prevent the tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
