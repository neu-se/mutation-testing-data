  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be doubled, leading to a wrong result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be increased by 10, leading to a wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be decreased by 10, leading to a wrong result.

DONE.
