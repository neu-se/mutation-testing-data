  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(other.attributes, this.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the arguments in the `diff` method, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(this.attributes, other.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `diff` method with the arguments in the opposite order, which could cause the method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(other.attributes, this.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `diff` method with the `priority` argument set to `true`, which could cause the method to return a different result.

DONE.
