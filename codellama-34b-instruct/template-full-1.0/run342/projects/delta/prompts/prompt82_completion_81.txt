  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = -arg.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is a string, and assigning a negative value to it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is a string, and assigning a zero value to it would result in a string with a length of 0, which is not the correct behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is a string, and assigning `undefined` to it would result in a string with a length of 0, which is not the correct behavior.

DONE.
