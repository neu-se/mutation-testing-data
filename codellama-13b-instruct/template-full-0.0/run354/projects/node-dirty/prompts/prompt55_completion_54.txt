  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas 'close' is emitted when the stream is closed and all data has been flushed to the underlying system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas 'error' is emitted when an error occurs on the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas 'finish' is emitted when the stream has finished writing all data to the underlying system.

DONE.
