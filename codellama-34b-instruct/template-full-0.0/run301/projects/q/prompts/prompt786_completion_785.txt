  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and will not have a `then` method, unlike `rejected` which is a function. This means that the promise returned by `Q(object)["finally"](callback)` will not be able to be chained with other promises using `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
