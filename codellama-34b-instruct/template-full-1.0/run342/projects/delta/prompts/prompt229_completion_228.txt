  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rounds up the peek length to the nearest integer, while the suggested replacement rounds down to the nearest integer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the peek length as is, while the suggested replacement adds 1 to the peek length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment rounds down the peek length to the nearest integer, while the suggested replacement rounds up to the nearest integer.

DONE.
