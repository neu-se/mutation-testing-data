  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `arguments` is an array-like object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` array starting from the second element, whereas `arguments` by itself would return the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return a shallow copy of the `arguments` array starting from the third element, whereas `arguments` by itself would return the entire array.

DONE.
