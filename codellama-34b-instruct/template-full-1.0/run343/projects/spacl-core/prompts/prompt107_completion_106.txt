  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.toLowerCase()` would return a lowercase version of the path, which could lead to incorrect query results if the policy uses case-sensitive path matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split('/').reverse()` would split the path into its components and reverse their order, which could lead to incorrect query results if the policy uses the order of path components to determine permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/fake/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because the policy would be queried with a different path than the one specified in the code, which could lead to incorrect query results if the policy uses the path to determine permissions.

DONE.
