  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, disregarding the length of the operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity, regardless of the length of the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the constant string "string", representing a changed behavior.

DONE.
