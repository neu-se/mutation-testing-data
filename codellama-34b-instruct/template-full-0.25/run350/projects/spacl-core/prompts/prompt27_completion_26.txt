  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with two arguments instead of one, and the second argument would be `false` instead of `true`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
