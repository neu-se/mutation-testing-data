 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would stop iterating over the array when it encounters the first falsy value, instead of always returning `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would stop iterating over the array as soon as it has returned all elements, instead of only when it has run out of elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null` after the first call, instead of returning the next element in the array.

DONE.
