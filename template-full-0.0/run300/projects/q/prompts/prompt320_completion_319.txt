  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is used instead of `apply`, which changes the value of `this` inside the called function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].bind(promise, args)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context and arguments, and then calls it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is used to remove the first element of the `args` array, which changes the arguments passed to the called function.

DONE.
