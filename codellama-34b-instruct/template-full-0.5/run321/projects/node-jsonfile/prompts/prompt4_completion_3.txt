  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object that contains the options for the `readFile` function, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods. This would cause the `readFile` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `encoding` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object that contains the options for the `readFile` function, while `{}` is an empty object that does not have any properties or methods. This would cause the `readFile` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `encoding` property of `{}`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `options` is an object that contains the options for the `readFile` function, while `undefined`
