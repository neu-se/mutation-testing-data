 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timeout === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the absence of a timeout value as null instead of undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof timeout === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the type of timeout being undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timeout === Q.timeout.NONE
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the absence of a timeout value as a special constant instead of undefined.

Note: `Q.timeout.NONE` is not defined in the provided code, but it's a common convention in libraries that provide timeouts to have a special value that represents "no timeout".

DONE.
