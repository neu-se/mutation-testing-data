  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator adds 1 to the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy, and `false` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed.

DONE.
