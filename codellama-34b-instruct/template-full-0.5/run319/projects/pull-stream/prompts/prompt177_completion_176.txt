  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for value inequality. This means that if `abort` is truthy but not strictly equal to `true`, the original code would not execute the `abortCb` function, while the new code would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `===` operator, which checks for both value and type equality, while the new code fragment uses the `!==` operator, which checks for value inequality. This means that if `abort` is falsy but not strictly equal to `false`, the original code would not execute the `abortCb` function, while the new code would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== undefined
