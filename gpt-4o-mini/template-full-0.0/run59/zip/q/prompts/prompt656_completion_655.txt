Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the total number of arguments passed to the function instead of slicing the arguments array, which would lead to incorrect handling of the additional arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument passed to the function instead of all arguments starting from the second, potentially ignoring important parameters needed for the method invocation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the expected array of arguments with an empty array, causing the method invocation to receive no arguments at all, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
