  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant value, unlike `cos` which is a function that changes its output based on its input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` is a different function than `cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value, unlike `cos` which is a function that changes its output based on its input.

DONE.
