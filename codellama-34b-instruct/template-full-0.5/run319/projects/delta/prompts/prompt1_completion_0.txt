  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a == null` is a different condition than `typeof a !== 'object'`. The former checks if `a` is null or undefined, while the latter checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` is a different condition than `typeof a !== 'object'`. The former checks if `a` is undefined, while the latter checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== 'object'` is a different condition than `typeof a !== 'object'`. The former checks if `a` is not the string 'object', while the latter checks if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
