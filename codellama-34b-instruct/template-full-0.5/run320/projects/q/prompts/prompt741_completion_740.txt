  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the entire array of promises, rather than just the first rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the entire array of promises, rather than just the first resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the entire array of promises, rather than just the first notified promise.

DONE.
