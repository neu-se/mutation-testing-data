 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use 0 as the indentation level instead of the `spaces` value passed in the options object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the default value of `undefined` as the indentation level instead of the `spaces` value passed in the options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.spaces
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `spaces` property of the current object, which might not exist, instead of using the `spaces` value passed in the options object.

DONE.
