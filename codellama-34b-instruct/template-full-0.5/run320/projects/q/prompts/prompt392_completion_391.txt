Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different, which could cause issues if the functions being passed in expect the arguments to be in a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, progressed, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is different, which could cause issues if the functions being passed in expect the arguments to be in a specific order.
