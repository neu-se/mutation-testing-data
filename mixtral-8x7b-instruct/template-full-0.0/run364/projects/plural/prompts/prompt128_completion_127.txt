 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute if `rules.length` is greater than 0, and no rules would be applied to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i in rules
