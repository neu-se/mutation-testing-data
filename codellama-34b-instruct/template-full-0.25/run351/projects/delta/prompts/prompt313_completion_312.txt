  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different value than `op.insert`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` is a different value than `op.insert`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is a different value than `op.insert`, and would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
