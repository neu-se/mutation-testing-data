  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that expects to be called with an argument, but `null` is not a function and would throw an error if called with the `()` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that expects to be called with an argument, but `undefined` is not a function and would throw an error if called with the `()` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"uncurryThis"
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis` is a function that expects to be called with an argument, but `"uncurryThis"` is a string and would not throw an error if called with the `()` operator, but it would return `undefined` instead of a function.

DONE.
