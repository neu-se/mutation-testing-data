  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent` is a different object than `ctx`, and the `query` method may not be defined on `ctx.parent`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.parent.query
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.parent.query` is a different method than `ctx.query`, and may not have the same behavior or side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.query.bind(ctx.parent)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.query.bind(ctx.parent)` creates a new function that is bound to `ctx.parent`, and may not have the same behavior or side effects as `ctx.query`.

DONE.
