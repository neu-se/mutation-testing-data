  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the next op instead of the current op, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the previous op instead of the current op, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the op after the next op instead of the current op, which could cause the `hasNext` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
