  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` operator would return `true` if `p` is falsy, which would cause the loop to continue even if `p` is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; !p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would be evaluated before the `!p` operator, which would cause the loop to continue even if `p` is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would be evaluated twice, which would cause the loop to continue even if `p` is resolved.

DONE.
