  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `end`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `end`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with an incorrect number of arguments.

DONE.
