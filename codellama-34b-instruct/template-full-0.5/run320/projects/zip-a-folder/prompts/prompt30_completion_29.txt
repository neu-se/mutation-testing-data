  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the output stream is closed, and resolves the promise when that event occurs. Replacing it with 'error' would cause the promise to be rejected when the output stream emits an 'error' event, which could happen if there is an issue with writing to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'close' event, which is emitted when the output stream is closed, and resolves the promise when that event occurs. Replacing it with 'finish' would cause the promise to be resolved when the output stream emits a 'finish' event, which could happen before the stream is closed, potentially resulting in incomplete data being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', reject
