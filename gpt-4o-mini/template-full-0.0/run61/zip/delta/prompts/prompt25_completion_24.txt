Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for equality instead of inequality, meaning that attributes that are equal in both objects would not be included in the resulting attributes, which is the opposite of the intended functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude attributes from `a` that are explicitly set to `null`, whereas the original code checks for any value that is not equal to `undefined`, potentially leading to attributes being included that should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include attributes from `b` only if they are explicitly `null`, which contradicts the original logic that includes attributes from `b` if they are not equal to the corresponding attribute in `a`.

DONE.
