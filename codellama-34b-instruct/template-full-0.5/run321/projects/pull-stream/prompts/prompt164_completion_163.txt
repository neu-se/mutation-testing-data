  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, so the code would execute the `cb` function even if `abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is truthy, so the `cb` function would only be called if `abort` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator only evaluates the second operand if the first operand is falsy, so the `cb` function would only be called if `abort` is falsy.

DONE.
