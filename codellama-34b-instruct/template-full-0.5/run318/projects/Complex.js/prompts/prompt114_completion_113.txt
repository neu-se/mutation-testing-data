  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `parse` function calls the `Complex` constructor, which in turn calls the `parse` function again.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be called with the arguments in reverse order, which could result in a different parsing result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be called with the sum of the `a` and `b` arguments, which could result in a different parsing result.

DONE.
