Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenReject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the provided value instead of resolving it, leading to a failure in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `value` only after the original promise is fulfilled, ignoring the original promise's resolution value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).thenResolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` instead of the original value, potentially altering the expected outcome in the promise chain.

DONE.
