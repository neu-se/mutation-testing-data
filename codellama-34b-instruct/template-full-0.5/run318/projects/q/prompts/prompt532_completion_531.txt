  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that is called on a promise, while `then` is a method that is called on a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).all
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that is called on a promise, while `all` is a method that is called on an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).race
```
This would result in different behavior because `spread` is a method that is called on a promise, while `race` is a method that is called on an array of promises.

DONE.
