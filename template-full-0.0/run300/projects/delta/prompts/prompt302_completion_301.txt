  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with an argument of 2 instead of 1, which would cause the iterator to advance by two elements instead of one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is incremented by 1 instead of being left unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable is decremented by 1 instead of being left unchanged.

DONE.
