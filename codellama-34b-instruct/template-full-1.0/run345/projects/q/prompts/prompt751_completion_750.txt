  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection));
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection message would be the same, which could cause the test to pass erroneously.

DONE.
