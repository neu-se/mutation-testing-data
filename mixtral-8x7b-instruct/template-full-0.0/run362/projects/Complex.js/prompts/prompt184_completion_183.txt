 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b > 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `b` is greater than 0 instead of checking if `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the following switch-case block to be skipped when `b` is 0 but `a` is greater than 0, which can lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b) === 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if the absolute value of `b` is equal to 0 instead of checking if `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the following switch-case block to be skipped when `b` is -0 or 0 but `a` is greater than 0, which can lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b === 1
