 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
glob.hasMagic(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `src` string has any glob syntax, instead of checking if `src` is a glob string itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
path.isAbsolute(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `src` string is an absolute path, instead of checking if `src` is a glob string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `src` is an array, instead of checking if `src` is a glob string. This change would cause the `zipArchive.directory` or `zipArchive.glob` method to be called with an incorrect argument when `src` is a string.

DONE.
