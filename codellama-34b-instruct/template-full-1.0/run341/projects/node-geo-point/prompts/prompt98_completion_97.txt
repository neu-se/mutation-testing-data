  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the destination point, whereas `x` is a random variable that has no relation to the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2` is the latitude of the destination point, whereas `x` is a random variable that has no relation to the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is the longitude of the current `GeoPoint` object, whereas `x` is a random variable that has no relation to the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
