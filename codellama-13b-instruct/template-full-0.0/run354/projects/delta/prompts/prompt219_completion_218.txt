  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops !== other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new delta with the same operations as the original delta, rather than concatenating the operations of the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops == other.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new delta with the same operations as the original delta, rather than concatenating the operations of the two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length === other.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would return a new delta with the same number of operations as the original delta, rather than concatenating the operations of the two deltas.

DONE.
