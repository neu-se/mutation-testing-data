  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("New exception"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the message "New exception", whereas the original code fragment would re-throw the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Error("New exception"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a new error object with the message "New exception", whereas the original code fragment would reject the promise with the original exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("New exception")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error object with the message "New exception", whereas the original code fragment would throw the original exception.

DONE.
