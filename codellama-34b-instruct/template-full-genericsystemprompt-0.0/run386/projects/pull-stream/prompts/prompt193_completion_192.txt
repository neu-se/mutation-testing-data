  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `aborted` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `false` if `aborted` is `true`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `true` if `aborted` is `false`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `aborted`.

DONE.
