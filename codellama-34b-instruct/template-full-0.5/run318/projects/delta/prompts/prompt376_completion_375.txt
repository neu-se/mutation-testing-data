  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion, while this replacement checks if it is a deletion. This would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion, while this replacement checks if it is a retention. This would cause the code to behave differently when the next operation is a retention.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekLength() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next operation is an insertion, while this replacement checks if it is an insertion with a length greater than 1.
