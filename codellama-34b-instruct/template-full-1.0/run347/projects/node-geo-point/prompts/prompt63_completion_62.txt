  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the destination point would be calculated as 180 degrees different from the original latitude, instead of being calculated based on the bearing and distance from the origin point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the destination point would be calculated as twice the original latitude, instead of being calculated based on the bearing and distance from the origin point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + random(-10, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the destination point would be calculated as a random value within a 10 degree range of the original latitude, instead of being calculated based on the bearing and distance from the origin point.

DONE.
