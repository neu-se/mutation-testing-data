 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `op` is falsy, it will use an empty object instead, potentially affecting the logic in the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op || null
