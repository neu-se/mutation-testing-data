  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would not be called, potentially causing errors in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfill` method is not a method of the deferred object, and therefore would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would not be called, and the promise would potentially resolve rather than reject.

DONE.
