  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would change the value of the argument passed to `call`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would change the value of the argument passed to `call`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would change the value of the argument passed to `call`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
