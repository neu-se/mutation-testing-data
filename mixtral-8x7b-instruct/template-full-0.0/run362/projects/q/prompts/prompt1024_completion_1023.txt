 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { nodeback && nodeback(null, value) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nextTick` is removed, and the callback will be executed synchronously if provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeback || (value => nodeback(null, value))
