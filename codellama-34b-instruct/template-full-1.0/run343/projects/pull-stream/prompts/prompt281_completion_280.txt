  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original code fragment, which is `mapper`. This change would cause the tests to fail if they are not able to handle the inverted output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the output of the original code fragment, which could cause the tests to fail if they are not able to handle the different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the output of the original code fragment, which could cause the tests to fail if they are not able to handle the different output.

DONE.
