  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```x + 1```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `ex`, which raises the base to the power of `x`, and calculates the `cos` of that result. By adding `1` to `x`, the result would be different, and the `cos` result would also be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```x - 1```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `ex`, which raises the base to the power of `x`, and calculates the `cos` of that result. By subtracting `1` from `x`, the result would be different, and the `cos` result would also be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with:
```x * 2```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `ex`, which raises the base to the power of `x`, and calculates the `cos` of that result. By multiplying `x`
