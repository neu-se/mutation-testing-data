  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the zoom level by 1 instead of 2, which would cause the map to be displayed at a different scale.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom * 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it would scale the map by half the zoom level, which would cause the map to be displayed at a different scale.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would display the map at a lower zoom level, which would cause the map to be displayed at a smaller scale.

DONE.
