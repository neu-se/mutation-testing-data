 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be shifted by 180 degrees, causing the calculated destination point to be in a completely different location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, -x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the x-coordinate is changed, causing the calculated destination point to be on the opposite side of the Earth along the same latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(x, y)
```
This would result in different behavior because the roles of x and y are swapped, causing the calculated destination point to be on a circle with a different radius around the origin, leading to incorrect distance and bearing calculations.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process highlights potential weaknesses in the test suite, giving developers a starting point
