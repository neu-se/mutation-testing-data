  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the entire delta, whereas `delta.retain` would retain only the specified length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { bold: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified length with the bold attribute set to true, whereas the original code would retain the specified length without any attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { bold: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the specified length with the bold attribute set to false, whereas the original code would retain the specified length without any attributes.

DONE.
