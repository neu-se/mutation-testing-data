  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pageurl` variable is a string, while this code fragment checks if the `pageurl` variable is a non-empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.includes("http")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pageurl` variable is a string, while this code fragment checks if the `pageurl` variable includes the substring "http".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.indexOf("http") > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `pageurl` variable is a string, while this code fragment checks if the `pageurl` variable contains the substring "http".

DONE.
