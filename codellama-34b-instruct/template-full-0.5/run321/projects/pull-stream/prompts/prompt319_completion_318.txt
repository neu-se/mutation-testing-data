  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `read` function's `end` parameter, and it would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not a valid value for the `read` function's `end` parameter, and it would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a valid value for the `read` function's `end` parameter, and it would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected data.

DONE.
