  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onwarning
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onwarning` is a different function than `Q.onerror`, and it may not be called in the same context as `Q.onerror`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.call(Q, e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror.call(Q, e)` is a different way of calling the `Q.onerror` function, and it may not be called in the same context as `Q.onerror`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror.apply(Q, [e])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror.apply(Q, [e])` is a different way of calling the `Q.onerror` function, and it may not be called in the same context as `Q.onerror`.

DONE.
