  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return at least 1, even if the `places` argument is 0 or negative. In the original code, `places || 0` would return 0 if `places` is 0 or negative, which is more appropriate for the `Math.pow()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the `places` argument, which would affect the result of the `Math.pow()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the `places` argument, which would affect the result of the `Math.pow()` function.

DONE.
