  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because if `busy` is true, the `map` function will be called even if `aborted` is true, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because if `aborted` is true, the `map` function will be called even if `busy` is false, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && !busy
```
This would result in different behavior because if `aborted` is true and `busy` is false, the `map` function will be called even if `aborted` is true, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
