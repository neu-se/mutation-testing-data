  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is an asynchronous function, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous function. In the original code, `fs.writeFileSync` is used to ensure that the file is written before the function returns, while `fs.writeFile` could return before the file is written, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fs` is `undefined` in the original code, and `fs.writeFileSync` is called directly, while `_fs.writeFileSync` would cause an error because `_fs` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync('a', 'b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not have any parameters for `fs.writeFileSync`, while passing `'a'` and `'b'`
