 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes an empty object as the second argument to `getCountry`, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable. This change could affect the behavior of `getCountry` if it relies on specific properties of the `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the second argument to `getCountry`, whereas the original code passes the `options` variable. This change could affect the behavior of `getCountry` if it handles `null` and `options` differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes a random number as the second argument to `getCountry` instead of the `options` variable. This change could affect the behavior of `getCountry` if it handles different inputs in distinct ways, especially if the function uses
