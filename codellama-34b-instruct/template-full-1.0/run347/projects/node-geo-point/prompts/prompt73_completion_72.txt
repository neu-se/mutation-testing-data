  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- distance
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the value of `distance`, causing the `calculateDestination` method to return a different resulting coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator will increase the value of `distance` by 1, causing the `calculateDestination` method to return a resulting coordinate that is slightly different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(distance)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root operation will change the value of `distance`, causing the `calculateDestination` method to return a different resulting coordinate.

DONE.
