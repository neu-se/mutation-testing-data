  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` anchor to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `^` anchor to match the start of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the case-sensitive flag, while the new code fragment uses the case-insensitive flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the global flag, while the new code fragment does not.

DONE.
