  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^#].*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that start with a `#`, whereas the new code fragment would match URLs that start with any character except `#`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences of the pattern in the URL, rather than just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\` character would cause the regular expression to match a literal `#` character, rather than treating it as a special character.

DONE.
