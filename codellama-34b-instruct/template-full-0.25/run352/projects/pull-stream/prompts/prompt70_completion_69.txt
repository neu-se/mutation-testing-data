  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is used instead of `===` to compare the result of `op(data)` to `false`. This would cause the loop to continue even if `op(data)` returns `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used to compare `abort` to `true` instead of `false`. This would cause the loop to continue even if `abort` is not `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used to compare `abort` to `true` instead of `false`.
