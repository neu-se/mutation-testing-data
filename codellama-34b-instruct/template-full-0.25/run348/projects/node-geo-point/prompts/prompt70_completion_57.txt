  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 360) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, while the new code fragment does not include this range check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 180) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, while the new code fragment does not include this range check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + 90) % 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to ensure that the result is within the range of 0 to 360 degrees, while the new code fragment does not include this range check.
