Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly resolve the promise immediately with a value of `true`, rather than waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a value of `null`, which may not be the intended behavior, especially if the original intention was to defer resolution until the timeout has elapsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with an `undefined` value, which could lead to confusion or errors in the promise chain, as the original code is expected to resolve with the value passed to the promise.

DONE.
