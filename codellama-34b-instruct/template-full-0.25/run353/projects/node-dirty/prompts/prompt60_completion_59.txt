  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._writeStream` is a writable stream, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a Map object, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object, while `this._readStream` is a readable stream.

DONE.
