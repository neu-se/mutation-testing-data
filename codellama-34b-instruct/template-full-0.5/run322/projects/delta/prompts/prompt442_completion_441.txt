  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the offset by 1, which could cause the iterator to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the offset by 1, which could cause the iterator to go back to the previous operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the offset, which could cause the iterator to skip over multiple operations.

DONE.
