  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that inserts an element at the end of an array, whereas `retain` is a method that retains a certain number of elements in an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a certain number of elements from the end of an array, whereas `retain` is a method that retains a certain number of elements in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a method that adds or removes elements from an array at a specified index, whereas `retain` is a method that retains a certain number of elements in an array.

DONE.
