  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test.test` is a property access, while `test.test()` is a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test.test` is a property access, while `test.test.bind(null)` is a function call with a bound context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `test.test` is a property access, while `test.test.call(null)` is a function call with a null context.

DONE.
