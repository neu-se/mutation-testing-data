  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isInfinite = function() {
  return !(this['isNaN']() || this['isFinite']());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a method definition, but this replacement is a property definition. The method definition would have created a new method on the Complex prototype object, while the property definition would have created a new property on the Complex prototype object.

DONE.
