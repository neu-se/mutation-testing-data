  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onUnhandledError);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a `null` value for the `reason` parameter, which could cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onUnhandledError, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called with a `null` value for the `value` parameter, which could cause it to throw an error or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` callbacks would be null, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
