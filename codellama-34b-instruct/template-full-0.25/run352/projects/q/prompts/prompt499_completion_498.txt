  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null` or `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"undefined"` is a string and would not be equivalent to the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a different value than `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
