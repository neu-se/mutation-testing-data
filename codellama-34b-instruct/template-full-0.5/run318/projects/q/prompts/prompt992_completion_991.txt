  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an additional argument to the `nodeArgs.push()` method, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only one argument to the `nodeArgs.push()` method, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array to the `nodeArgs.push()` method, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
