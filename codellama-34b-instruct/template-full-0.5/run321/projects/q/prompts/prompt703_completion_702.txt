  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong arguments to the `dispatch` method, causing it to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
