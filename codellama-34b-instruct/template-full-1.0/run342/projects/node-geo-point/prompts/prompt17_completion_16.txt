  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<latitude: point.coordinates[0], longitude: point.coordinates[1]>
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the latitude and longitude values reversed, which could cause issues in the `calculateDistance` and `calculateBearing` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could cause issues in the `calculateDistance` and `calculateBearing` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access a non-existent element of the coordinates array, which would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
