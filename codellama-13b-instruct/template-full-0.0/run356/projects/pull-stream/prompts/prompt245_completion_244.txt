  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || err
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the operands are combined using the logical AND operator instead of the logical OR operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err || !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the operands are combined using the logical OR operator, but the second operand is negated using the logical NOT operator.

DONE.
