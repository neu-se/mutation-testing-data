  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key-value pair from the queue, whereas the original code fragment would add the key-value pair to the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method would remove all key-value pairs from the queue, whereas the original code fragment would add the key-value pair to the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would replace the value associated with the key in the queue, whereas the original code fragment would add the key-value pair to the queue.

DONE.
