  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event will still be emitted, but the 'error' event will not be emitted. The resulting archive file may not be complete or correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event will still be emitted, but the 'end' event will not be emitted. The archive file may be incomplete or corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'abort', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'close' event will still be emitted, but the 'abort' event will not be emitted. The archive file may be incomplete or corrupted.

DONE.
