  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` because `line.length` is a positive number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` because `line.length` is a non-negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` if `line.length` is greater than 1, and `false` if `line.length` is 1 or less.

DONE.
