  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== null && spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not end with a slash and is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== null && spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== undefined && spec.match(/^.+\/$/) !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path ends with a slash, while this new code fragment checks if the path does not end with a slash, is
