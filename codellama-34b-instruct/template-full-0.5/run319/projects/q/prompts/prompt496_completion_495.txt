  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the message property of the rejection object instead of the rejection object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the stack property of the rejection object instead of the rejection object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the name property of the rejection object instead of the rejection object itself.

DONE.
