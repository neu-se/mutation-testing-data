  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    IsArrayCotainer(baseOpData)
```
This would result in different behavior because `IsArrayContainer` is not a function and would cause a syntax error, whereas `baseOpData` is an array and the code would not crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    baseOpData.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOpData.length` is 1, while `baseOpData.length + 1` is 2, and the code would perform a different operation based on the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    baseOpData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseOpData[0]` refers to the first element of the array, while `baseOpData` refers to the entire array, and the code would perform a different operation based on the value of the element.

DONE.
