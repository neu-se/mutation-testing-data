  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `value` is a truthy value. If the function is expected to return a truthy value, the test would fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `value` is a truthy value. If the function is expected to return a truthy value, the test would fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, while `value` is a truthy value. If the function is expected to return a truthy value, the test would fail.

DONE.
