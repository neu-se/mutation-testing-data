  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.value` is undefined, whereas `row.val` is defined as a property of the `row` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row["val"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `row["val"]` is undefined, whereas `row.val` is defined as a property of the `row` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.value = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `row.value` would be set to `undefined`, whereas `row.val` would retain its original value.

DONE.
