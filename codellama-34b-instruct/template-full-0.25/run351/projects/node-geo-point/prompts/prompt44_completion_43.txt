  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(r)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `Math.acos(r)` would return a value between 0 and π.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(r)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `Math.acos(r)` would return a value between 0 and π.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(r)` would return a value between -∞ and ∞, while `Math.acos(r)` would return a value between 0 and π.

DONE.
