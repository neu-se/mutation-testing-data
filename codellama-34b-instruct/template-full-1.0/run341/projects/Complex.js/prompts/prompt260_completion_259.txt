  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function expects a non-zero value for the `b` parameter, but `0` would cause the function to return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function expects a non-zero value for the `b` parameter, but `1` would cause the function to return the natural log of `1`, or `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function expects a non-zero value for the `b` parameter, but `-1` would cause the function to return the natural log of `-1`, or a complex number.

DONE.
