  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons` is an array of strings, while `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` is an array of promises that have been reported as unhandled, while `unhandledRejections` is an array of all unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections.length` is the number of unhandled rejections, while `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises.

DONE.
