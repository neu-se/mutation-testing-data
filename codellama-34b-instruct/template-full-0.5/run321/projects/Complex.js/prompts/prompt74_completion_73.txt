  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument in the `parser_exit()` function call, while the replaced code fragment includes an argument of `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument in the `parser_exit()` function call, while the replaced code fragment includes an argument of `"Invalid input"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include an argument in the `parser_exit()` function call, while the replaced code fragment includes an argument of `a`, which is a variable that is defined earlier in the code.

DONE.
