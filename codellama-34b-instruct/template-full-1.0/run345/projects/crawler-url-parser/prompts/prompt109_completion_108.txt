  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Map` to always store a key of `currentUrl.url` and a value of `null`, which would not allow for accurate identification of duplicate URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Map` to always store a key of `null` and a value of `currentUrl`, which would not allow for accurate identification of duplicate URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + Math.random(), currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Map` to always store a unique key every time a duplicate URL was encountered, which would prevent the `Map` from accurately identifying duplicate URLs.

DONE.
