  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `when` returns `this`, which is the promise that is being constructed. Replacing `Q` with `null` would return `null` instead of the promise, which would break the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `when` returns `this`, which is the promise that is being constructed. Replacing `Q` with `undefined` would return `undefined` instead of the promise, which would break the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(Error("test"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `when` returns `this`, which is the promise that is being constructed. Replacing `Q` with `Q.reject(Error("test"))` would change the behavior of the promise chain, as it would now be rejected with an error instead of resolved.
