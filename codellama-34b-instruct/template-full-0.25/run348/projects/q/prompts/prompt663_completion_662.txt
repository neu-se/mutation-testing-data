  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the third argument instead of the second, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the first argument instead of the second, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the second argument instead of all the arguments, which could cause the method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
