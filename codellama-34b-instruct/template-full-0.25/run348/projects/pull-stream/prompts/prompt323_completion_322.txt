  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === true ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with the `abort` argument, whereas the original code fragment did not call any function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(abort === false ? null : abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with the `abort` argument only if `abort` is `false`, whereas the original code fragment called the `onEnd` function with the `abort` argument regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `onEnd` function with `null` as the argument, whereas the original code fragment called the `onEnd` function with the `abort` argument.

DONE.
