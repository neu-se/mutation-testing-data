  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 instead of 0 when places is undefined or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 instead of 1 when places is undefined or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 instead of 1 when places is undefined or null.

DONE.
