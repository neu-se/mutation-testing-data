  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(0, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta from the beginning to the index, rather than from the index to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta from the index + 1 to the end, rather than from the beginning to the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(index, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base delta from the index to the index + 1, rather than from the beginning to the end.

DONE.
