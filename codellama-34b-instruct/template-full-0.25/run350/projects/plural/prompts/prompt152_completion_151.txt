  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` variable is used to determine the plural form of the input word, and adding 1 to it would change the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` variable is used to determine the plural form of the input word, and subtracting 1 from it would change the plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `num` variable is used to determine the plural form of the input word, and multiplying it by 2 would change the plural form.

DONE.
