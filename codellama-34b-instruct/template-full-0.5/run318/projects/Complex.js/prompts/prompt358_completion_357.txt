  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, which could change the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the value of `a`, which could change the result of the `cosh` function.

DONE.
