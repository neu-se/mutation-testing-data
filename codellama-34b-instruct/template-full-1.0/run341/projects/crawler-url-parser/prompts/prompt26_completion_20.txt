  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#./$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a dollar sign (`$`) to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses a dot (`.`) which matches any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#[^ veeligglæ Dar]/$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment has an additional character class (`[^ veeligglæ Dar]`) that matches any character that is not a letter or a whitespace, while the original code fragment does not have this extra character class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#\w+/gi, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment uses the word boundary (`\w`) to match any word character, while the original code fragment does not use a word boundary. Additionally, the new code fragment uses the `g` flag to make the match global, while the original code fragment does not use this
