  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.push` would add the new element to the end of the array, whereas `stacks.unshift` adds it to the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.pop` would remove the last element of the array, whereas `stacks.unshift` adds a new element to the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.shift` removes the first element of the array, whereas `stacks.unshift` adds a new element to the beginning.

DONE.
