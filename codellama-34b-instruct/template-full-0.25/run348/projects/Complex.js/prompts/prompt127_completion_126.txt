  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()

DONE.
