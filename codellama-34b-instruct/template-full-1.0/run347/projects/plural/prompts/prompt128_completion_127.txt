  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never terminate, causing the function to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run beyond the end of the rules array, potentially causing an index out of bounds error or producing unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, causing the function to return the original word without any modifications.

DONE.
