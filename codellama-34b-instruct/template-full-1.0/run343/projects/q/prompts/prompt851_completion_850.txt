  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is not called, and the promise is never rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is called, and the promise is resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is thrown before the promise is rejected, and the error is thrown before the promise is resolved.

DONE.
