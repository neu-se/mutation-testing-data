  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include one more argument than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include a different set of arguments than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
