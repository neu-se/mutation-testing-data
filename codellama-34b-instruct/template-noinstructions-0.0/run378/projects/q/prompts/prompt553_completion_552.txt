  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value.then(function(value) {
    return value;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to be called on the `result.value` promise, which would return a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise. This would cause the `when` method to be called on the new promise, which would return a new promise that resolves with the value of the original promise. This would result in an infinite loop of promises being created and resolved, causing the program to hang.
