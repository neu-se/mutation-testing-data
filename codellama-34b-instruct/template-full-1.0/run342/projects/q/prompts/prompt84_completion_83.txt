  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `flush` function, which empties the `tail` queue, while the modified code does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `flush` function, which empties the `tail` queue, while the modified code does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `flush` function, which empties the `tail` queue, while the modified code returns early and does not empties the `tail` queue.

DONE.
