  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot
```
This would result in different behavior because `filterNot` is not a function, it is a variable that is defined in the `filter` module, and it is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(function (data) { return !test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filterNot` function is called with a different argument, which is a function that returns the negation of the result of the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filterNot(function (data) { return !test(data) }, 'foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filterNot` function is called with an additional argument, which is the string `'foo'`.

DONE.
