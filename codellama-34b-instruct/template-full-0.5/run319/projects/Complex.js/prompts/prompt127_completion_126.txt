  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to exit early if either `this` or `z` are infinite, even if they are not both infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to exit early if both `this` and `z` are infinite, even if they are not both infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to exit early if neither `this` nor `z` are infinite, even if they are both infinite.

DONE.
