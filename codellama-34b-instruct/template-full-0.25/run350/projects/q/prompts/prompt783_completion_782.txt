  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progressed callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the rejected callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, fulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fulfilled callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
