  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than `||`, so the `a && !onEnd` expression would be evaluated first, and then the resulting value would be combined with `a` using the `||` operator. This could cause the `onEnd` function to be called even if `a` is `false`, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator has a higher precedence than `||`, so the `a != !onEnd` expression would be evaluated first, and then the resulting value would be combined with `a` using the `||` operator. This could cause the `onEnd` function to be called even if `a` is `false`, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a | !onEnd
```
