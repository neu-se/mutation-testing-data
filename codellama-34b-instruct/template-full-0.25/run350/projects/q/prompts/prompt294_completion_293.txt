  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be notified instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver` would be called instead of `deferred.reject`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a node-style callback instead of rejected.

DONE.
