  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'spec'.replace(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the original code fragment matches the entire string `spec`, while the modified code fragment only matches the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'spec'.replace(/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the original code fragment matches the entire string `spec`, while the modified code fragment only matches the first occurrence of the `/` character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'spec'.replace(/^/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression in the original code fragment matches the entire string `spec`, while the modified code fragment only matches the beginning of the string.

DONE.
