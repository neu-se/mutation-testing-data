  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `delete` property of the last operation is equal to the `insert` property of the new operation, which is not what the original code is doing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete + newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `delete` property of the last operation to the `insert` property of the new operation, which is not what the original code is doing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete * newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the `delete` property of the last operation by the `insert` property of the new operation, which is not what the original code is doing.

DONE.
