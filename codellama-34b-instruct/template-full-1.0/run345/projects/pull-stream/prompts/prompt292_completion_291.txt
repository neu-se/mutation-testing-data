  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the item is passed through when it is seen for the second time, but with `false` as the second argument, the item would be passed through regardless of whether it has been seen before or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !field
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the item is passed through when it is seen for the second time, but with `!field` as the second argument, the item would be passed through only when it has not been seen before (i.e., when `field` is false).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the item is passed through when it is seen for the second time, but with `'!'` concatenated to the end of the item, it would be passed through regardless of whether it has been seen before or not
