  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to return a different range of indices, potentially including or excluding some of the original indices.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to return a different range of indices, potentially including or excluding some of the original indices.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice method to return a different range of indices, potentially including or excluding some of the original indices.

DONE.
