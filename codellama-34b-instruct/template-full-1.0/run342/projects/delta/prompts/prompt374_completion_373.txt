  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` is a function that moves the iterator to the next element, but `thisIter.next()` calls the function and returns the next element, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the returned element is not what was expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.previous` returns the previous element, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the previous element is not what was expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.current()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.current` returns the current element, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the current element is not what was expected.

DONE.
