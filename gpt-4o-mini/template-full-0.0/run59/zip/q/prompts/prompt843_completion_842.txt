Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extend the timeout by an additional second, causing the promise to wait longer before rejecting, potentially leading to unexpected delays in handling timeouts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively set the timeout to zero milliseconds, causing the promise to resolve immediately without waiting, which could lead to premature resolution or rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would halve the timeout duration, causing the promise to reject sooner than intended, which could lead to more frequent timeout errors.

DONE.
