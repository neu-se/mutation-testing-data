  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a negative number produces a complex number, whereas the square root of a positive number produces a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the cube of a number is much larger than the square of the number, so the resulting complex number would have a much larger magnitude and be in a different part of the complex plane.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the square root of a number multiplied by 2 is always positive, whereas the square root of the original expression can produce positive and negative numbers.

DONE.
