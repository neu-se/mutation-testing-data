  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within functions, and it is not possible to access it from outside a function. Therefore, using `arguments, 2` would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within functions, and it is not possible to access it from outside a function. Therefore, using `arguments, 0` would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is a special object that is only available within functions, and it is not possible to access it from outside a function. Therefore, using `arguments, 3` would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
