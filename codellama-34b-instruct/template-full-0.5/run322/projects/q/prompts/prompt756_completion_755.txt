  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` returns a promise that is rejected with an error if any of the input promises are rejected, while `allResolved` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises, regardless of their states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anyResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `anyResolved` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first resolved promise, while `allResolved` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of states for the respective promises, while `allResolved` returns a promise that is resolved with an array of promises.

DONE.
