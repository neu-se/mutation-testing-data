  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `delete` are different methods in the `retDelta` object, and calling `insert` instead of `delete` would result in the wrong behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different methods in the `retDelta` object, and calling `retain` instead of `delete` would result in the wrong behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` and `delete` are different methods in the `retDelta` object, and calling `concat` instead of `delete` would result in the wrong behavior.

DONE.
