Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the scaling factor for rounding the real and imaginary parts would be halved, leading to less precision in the rounded result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the scaling factor for rounding would be set to Euler's number (approximately 2.718), which is not a power of 10, thus producing unexpected rounding results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the scaling factor would be increased by 1, effectively rounding to a higher precision than intended, which could lead to incorrect results in the rounding operation.

DONE.
