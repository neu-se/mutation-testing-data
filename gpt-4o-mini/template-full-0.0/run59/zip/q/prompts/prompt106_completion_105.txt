Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because starting the index at 1 instead of 0 would cause the first element of the array to be skipped during the search, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because initializing the index to -1 would cause the loop to never execute, resulting in the function returning -1 immediately, indicating that the value was not found regardless of its presence in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because starting the index at the length of the array would cause the loop to never execute, leading to a return value of -1, indicating that the value was not found, even if it exists in the array.

DONE.
