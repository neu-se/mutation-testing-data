  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the strings instead of adding their lengths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would subtract the length of the second string from the length of the first string, rather than returning the minimum of the two lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the length of the first string by the length of the second string, rather than returning the minimum of the two lengths.

DONE.
