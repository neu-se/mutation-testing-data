 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the 'http' module instead of checking if the URL starts with 'https' and using the 'https' module if it does. This could lead to issues when downloading files over a secure connection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
request
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the same request object, regardless of whether the URL starts with 'https' or not. This could lead to issues when downloading files over a secure connection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() > 0.5 ? https : http
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would randomly choose between the 'https' and 'http' modules, rather than checking if the URL starts with 'https'. This could lead to issues when downloading files over a secure connection, as the code may sometimes choose to use the 'http' module even if
