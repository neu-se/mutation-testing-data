  **OPTION 1**
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `last` instead of `++ended`, and `++ended` would increment `ended` by 1 each time it is called.

**OPTION 2**
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended--
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `last` instead of `ended--`, and `ended--` would decrement `ended` by 1 each time it is called.

**OPTION 3**
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `last` instead of `!ended`, and `!ended` would negate the value of `ended` each time it is called.

DONE.
