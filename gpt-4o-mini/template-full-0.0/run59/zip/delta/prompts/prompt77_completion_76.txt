Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat a valid object as invalid, potentially causing the insertion logic to fail when it should succeed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow null values to bypass the check, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to process operations that should not be null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(lastOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if `lastOp` is an array instead of an object, which would disrupt the logic that expects `lastOp` to be an object and could lead to runtime errors or incorrect operation handling.

DONE.
