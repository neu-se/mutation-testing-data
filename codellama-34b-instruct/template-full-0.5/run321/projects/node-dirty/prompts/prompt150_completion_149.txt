  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with no arguments, while this replacement would call it with an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with no arguments, while this replacement would call it with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with no arguments, while this replacement would call it with `null`.

DONE.
