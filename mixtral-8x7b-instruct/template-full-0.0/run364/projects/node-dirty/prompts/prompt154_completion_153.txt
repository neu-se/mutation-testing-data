 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method no longer receives a callback function, which could cause issues if the `write` method calls the callback asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.uncork(this);
