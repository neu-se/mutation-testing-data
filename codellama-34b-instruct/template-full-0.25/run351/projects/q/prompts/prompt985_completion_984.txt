  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` is a bound function that will always refer to the `this` object of the current execution context, whereas `this.dispatch` is a property that may refer to different objects depending on the context in which it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` is a function call that will always refer to the `this` object of the current execution context, whereas `this.dispatch` is a property that may refer to different objects depending on the context in which it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` is a function call that will always refer to the `this` object of the current execution context,
