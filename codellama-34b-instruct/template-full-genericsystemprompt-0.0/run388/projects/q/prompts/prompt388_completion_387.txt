  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a null callback, which would result in a rejected promise with a `TypeError` exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a callback that throws an error, which would result in a rejected promise with the thrown error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a callback that returns a rejected promise with the value "test".

DONE.
