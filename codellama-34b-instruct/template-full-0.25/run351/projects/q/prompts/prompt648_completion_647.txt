  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be modified, which could cause issues if the function relies on the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because a new array would be created, which could cause issues if the function relies on the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.concat()]
```
This would result in different behavior because a new array would be created, which could cause issues if the function relies on the original array.

DONE.
