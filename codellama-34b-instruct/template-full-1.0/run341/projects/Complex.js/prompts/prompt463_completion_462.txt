  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) >= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `b` is greater than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `b` is not zero, regardless of its absolute value.

DONE.
