  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is called with the `promises` array as an argument, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `all`. This would cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an empty array, which would result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all(promises, function (promise) {
    return when(promise, noop, noop);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is called with a callback function that returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `when` function, whereas the original code fragment does not pass any arguments to `all`. This would cause the `all` function to return a promise that resolves to an array of promises, which would result in different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
