  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it is null.

DONE.
