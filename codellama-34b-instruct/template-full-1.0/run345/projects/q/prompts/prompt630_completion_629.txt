  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["dispacth"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `["dispacth"]` syntax will not work correctly with the object `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch` method expects the object to be passed as the first argument, and not as a property of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object.dispatch` method expects the `Q` object to be passed as an argument, and not as the object being applied to the method.
