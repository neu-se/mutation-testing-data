  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `module.js` file would not be loaded, and the code would not be executed as expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(main.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `main.js` file would be loaded instead of the `module.js` file, and the code would not be executed as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(index.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index.js` file would be loaded instead of the `module.js` file, and the code would not be executed as expected.

DONE.
