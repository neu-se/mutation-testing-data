  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index+=1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+=1` operator is different from the specified `++` operator

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index++++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++++` operators are different from the specified `++` operator

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index+2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+2` code fragment is different from the specified `++` operator.
