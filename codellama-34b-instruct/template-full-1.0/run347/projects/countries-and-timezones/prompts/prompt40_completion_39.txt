  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the enum's properties, while `Object.assign` is used to copy the properties of one object to another.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` creates a new object with the specified prototype and properties, while `Object.assign` is used to copy the properties of one object to another.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperties
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.defineProperties` defines properties on an object with the specified descriptors, while `Object.assign` is used to copy the properties of one object to another.

DONE.
