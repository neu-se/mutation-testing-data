  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce()` returns a single value by iterating over the elements of an array and combining them using a reducer function, while `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the original array.

DONE.
