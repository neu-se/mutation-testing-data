 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator checks for the truthiness of `attributes` instead of checking if it is an object. This means that if `attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, the expression will evaluate to `undefined` instead of throwing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, the expression will evaluate to an empty object instead of throwing an error. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the code relies on the fact that `attributes` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression now assumes that `attributes` has a property called `key`. If `attributes` is `null` or `undefined`, this would throw a
