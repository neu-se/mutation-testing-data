  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete` only removes a specific element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` would add a new element to the map with a key of `baseUrlStr` and a value of `null`, while `delete` would remove an existing element from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove an existing element from the map with a key of `baseUrlStr`, while `set()` would add a new element to the map with a key of `baseUrlStr` and a value of `null`.

DONE.
