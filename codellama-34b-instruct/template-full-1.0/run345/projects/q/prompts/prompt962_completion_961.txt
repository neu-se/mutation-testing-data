  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would refer to the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would refer to the length of the `args` array, which may be different from the number of arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code would refer to the first element of the `arguments` array, which may be different from the first argument passed to the function.

DONE.
