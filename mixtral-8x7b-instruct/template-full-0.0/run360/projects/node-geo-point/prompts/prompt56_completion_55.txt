 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is the same as `cos`, but it is more verbose and explicitly calls the global `Math` object. This might cause issues if the code execution context changes or if the `Math` object is not available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos(1 / r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the arccosine of the reciprocal of `r`, which is different from the original expression `acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r)`. This would cause incorrect results when `r` is greater than 1, as it would return a negative value for the arccosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates
