Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(Op.length(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of deleting the operation, it incorrectly pushes the length of the operation onto the inverted Delta, potentially leading to an incorrect representation of the inverted operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(op.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains the operation instead of deleting it, which would cause the inverted Delta to incorrectly maintain the original operation instead of removing it, leading to discrepancies in the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(op) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes one more than the length of the operation, which could lead to an off-by-one error in the inverted Delta, potentially omitting necessary operations or causing an incorrect state.

DONE.
