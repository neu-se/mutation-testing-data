  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `undefined` is not a string, so the `typeof` operator would return different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert` is a string, and `lastOp.insert.length` is the length of that string, so the comparison would return different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.insert.length` is the length of the string, and a negative length is not a valid value, so the comparison would return different values.

DONE.
