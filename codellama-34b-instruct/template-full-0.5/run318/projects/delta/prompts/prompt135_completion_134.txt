  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the same value, regardless of the input, which would cause the code to fail to detect certain types of errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return a fixed length, regardless of the input, which would cause the code to fail to detect certain types of errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the same value, regardless of the input, which would cause the code to fail to detect certain types of errors.

DONE.
