  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` constructor would receive a `null` value instead of a function, which would cause it to return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` constructor would receive an `undefined` value instead of a function, which would cause it to return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q` constructor would receive an empty function instead of the original function, which would cause it to return a resolved promise with an empty value.

DONE.
