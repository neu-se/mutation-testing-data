  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` waits for all promises to be settled, while `allRejected` waits for all promises to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` waits for all promises to be settled, while `anyResolved` waits for any promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` waits for all promises to be settled, while `allFulfilled` waits for all promises to be fulfilled.

DONE.
