  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `error` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return `null` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `error` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return `undefined` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Different error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error with the message "Can't get value from closed queue", while the new code fragment would throw an error with the message "Different error message".

DONE.
