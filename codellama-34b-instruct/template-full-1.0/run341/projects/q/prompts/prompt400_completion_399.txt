  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `thenResolve()` method to be called with the rejection reason as its argument, rather than the resolution value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is `undefined`, and calling `Q.thenResolve()` with an undefined value would result in a rejected promise with a rejection reason of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello world"` is a string value, and calling `Q.thenResolve()` with a string value would result in a rejected promise with a rejection reason of the string.

DONE.
