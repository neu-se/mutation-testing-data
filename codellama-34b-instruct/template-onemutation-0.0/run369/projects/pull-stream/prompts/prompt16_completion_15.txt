  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object is now one less than the actual length of the arguments passed to the function. This could cause the function to skip over the last argument, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
