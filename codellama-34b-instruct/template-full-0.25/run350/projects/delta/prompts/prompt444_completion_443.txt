  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1, length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` and `length` variables are used in the `substr` method, which extracts a substring from the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object. By adding 1 to the `offset` and subtracting 1 from the `length`, the resulting substring would be different from the original substring, which could cause the `next` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` and `length` variables are used in the `substr` method, which extracts a substring from the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object. By adding the `length` to the `offset` and setting the `length` to 0, the resulting substring would be different from the original substring, which could cause the `next` method to return a different value.
