  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the next operation to be skipped or partially applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the next operation to be applied twice or applied to the wrong part of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the next operation in the other iterator, potentially causing the next operation to be applied twice or applied to the wrong part of the document.

DONE.
