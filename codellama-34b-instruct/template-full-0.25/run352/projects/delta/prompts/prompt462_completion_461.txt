  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the elements starting from the specified index, whereas the original code returns the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes the element at the specified index and returns a new array with the removed element, whereas the original code returns the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of the array and returns it, whereas the original code returns the entire array.

DONE.
