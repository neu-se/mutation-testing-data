  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the `set` method to assign the value to the wrong property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is the same as the key, which would cause the `set` method to overwrite the property with itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value being set is the same as the value, which would cause the `set` method to overwrite the property with itself.

DONE.
