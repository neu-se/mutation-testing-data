  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a` is equal to `0`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `b` is not equal to `a`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a` is not equal to `b`, regardless of the value of `a`.

DONE.
