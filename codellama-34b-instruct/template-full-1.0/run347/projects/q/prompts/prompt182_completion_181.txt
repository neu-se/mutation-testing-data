  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regex to not match the stack line and the filter function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine + ">"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regex to not match the stack line and the filter function would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the filter function to be called with a different argument and the result of the function would be different.

DONE.
