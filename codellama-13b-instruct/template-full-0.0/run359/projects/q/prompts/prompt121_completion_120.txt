  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now initialized to `0`, which is a falsy value. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `key` variable is used in a conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "key";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now initialized to the string `"key"`, which is a truthy value. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `key` variable is used in a conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `key` variable is now initialized to `undefined`, which is a falsy value. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the `key` variable is used in a conditional statement.
