  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is a non-null value, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive an invalid argument and potentially throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is a defined value, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to receive an undefined argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` variable is a non-empty array, but replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive a different set of arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
