  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not equal to `undefined` and `b[key]` is equal to `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `a[key]` is equal to `undefined` and `b[key]` is not equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not equal to `undefined` and `b[key]` is equal to `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks if `a[key]` is not equal to `undefined` or `b[key]` is equal to `undefined`.
