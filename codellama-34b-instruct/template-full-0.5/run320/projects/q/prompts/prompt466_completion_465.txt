  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the code is checking if `atReport` is equal to `-1`, so using `===` instead of `!==` would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks if the value is greater than the given number, while the `!==` operator checks for inequality. In this case, the code is checking if `atReport` is greater than `-1`, so using `>` instead of `!==` would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport >= -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator checks if the value is greater than or equal to the given number, while the `!==`
