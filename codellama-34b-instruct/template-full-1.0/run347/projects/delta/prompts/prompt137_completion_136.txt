  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null &&
      Math.random() < 0.5
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a random element, so the mutation test would have a higher chance of finding a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null &&
      typeof firstOther.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific type of object, so the mutation test would have a higher chance of finding a weakness in the test suite if it is not able to handle different types of objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null &&
