 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<div>' + $(this).text().trim() + '</div>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the text with `<div>` tags, which might affect the layout or behavior of the webpage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).data('text')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `data-text` attribute of the anchor element, which might not exist or have a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('data-text')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `data-text` attribute as an HTML attribute, which might not exist or have a value.

DONE.
