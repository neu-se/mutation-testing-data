  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `otherData` is used, but in this modified code, the constant `1` is used instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `otherData` is used, but in this modified code, the constant `0` is used instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value of `otherData` is used, but in this modified code, the string `'a'` is used instead.

DONE.
