  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.fulfill` is a different method than `deferred.reject`, and would result in the promise being fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a different method than `deferred.reject`, and would result in the promise being notified instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a different method than `deferred.reject`, and would result in the promise being resolved instead of rejected.

DONE.
