 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would always return `false` instead of invoking the callback `cb` with an error or value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would always return the next value as `true`, regardless of the actual value in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned function would immediately return the next value without checking if the index `i` is within the array's bounds, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
