 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.assign({}, thisOp.attributes, otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of using the original ones, which could cause issues if the attributes object is used elsewhere in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.attributes.concat(otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the attributes arrays instead of merging them, which could cause issues if the attributes are expected to be merged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ ...thisOp.attributes, ...otherOp.attributes }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the spread operator, which could cause issues if the attributes object is used elsewhere in the code and its reference is expected to be preserved.

DONE.
