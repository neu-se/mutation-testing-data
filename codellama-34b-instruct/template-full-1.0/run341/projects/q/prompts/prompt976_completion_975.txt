  DONE. Here are my options for replacement and explanations for why the change in behavior results:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`null`
This could result in a "TypeError: Cannot read property 'push' of null" 
if the method is called with a null value, as `null` does not have a 
`push` method. The original code uses the OR operator to set 
`args` to an empty array if it is undefined, so it will not cause this 
error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
`[42]`
This would cause a problem if the function was called without the `args` 
argument, as an array with a single element, 42, would always be used 
 rather than the passed-in `args` array.The original code uses the OR 
 operator expression to handle if the `args` argument is not defined by 
 setting it to an empty array. As a result, the original code will not 
produce this problem.
