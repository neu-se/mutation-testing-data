  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.json'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the file exists with the exact name provided, while this code would check if a file with the same name and a '.json' extension exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the file exists with the exact name provided, while this code would check if a file with the same name but in uppercase exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the file exists with the exact name provided, while this code would check if a file with the same name but without the extension exists.

DONE.
