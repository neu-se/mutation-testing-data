  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd && onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the onEnd function as a boolean, whereas this new code checks if onEnd is a function and calls it if it is. If onEnd is not a function, the behavior would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd || onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the onEnd function as a boolean, whereas this new code checks if onEnd is falsey and calls it if it is. If onEnd is not falsey, the behavior would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd ? onEnd() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the onEnd function as a boolean, whereas this new code checks if onEnd is true and calls it if it is. If onEnd is false, the behavior would be different.

DONE.
