Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would lead to incorrect comparisons in the `reduce` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the keys to only the first key of object `b`, which would cause the `reduce` function to only consider a single key instead of all keys, potentially missing differences in other properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a).filter(key => a[key] !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the keys of `a` to only include those that are defined, which would ignore keys in `b` that are not present in `a`, leading to incomplete attribute comparisons.

DONE.
