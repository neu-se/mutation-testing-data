  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue even if all promises have been resolved, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only continue if the number of pending promises is equal to the total number of promises, which is not necessarily the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only continue if there are no pending promises and there are still promises to be resolved, which is not necessarily the case.

DONE.
