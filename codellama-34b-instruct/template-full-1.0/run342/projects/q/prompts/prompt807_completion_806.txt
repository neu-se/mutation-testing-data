  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q("foo").then()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always try to resolve the promise with the string "foo", regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["Q"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always try to resolve the promise with the array `["Q"]`, regardless of the value of `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always try to resolve the promise with a randomly generated number, regardless of the value of `object`.

DONE.
