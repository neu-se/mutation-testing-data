  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'function' === typeof stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `stream` variable is not a function, while the new code fragment checks if it is a function. This change would cause the `nextStream` function to be called even if the `stream` variable is a function, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
