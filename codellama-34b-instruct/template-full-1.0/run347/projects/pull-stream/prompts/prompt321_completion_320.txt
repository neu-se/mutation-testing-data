  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read function to receive the same item twice, which could cause issues with the test suite's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read function to receive a different value (undefined) than it would receive in the original code fragment (data).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read function to receive two null values, which could cause issues with the test suite's logic.

DONE.
