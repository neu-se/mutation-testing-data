  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator matches zero or more characters, whereas the `+` operator matches one or more characters. This change would cause the regular expression to match a wider range of inputs, potentially leading to false positives in the test suite.
