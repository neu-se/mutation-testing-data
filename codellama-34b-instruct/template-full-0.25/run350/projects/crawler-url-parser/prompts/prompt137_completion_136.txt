  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with "/", while the new code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with "/", while the new code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'<PLACEHOLDER>'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with "/", while the new code fragment replaces the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with the string "<PLACEHOLDER>".
