 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.size` value is being incremented by 1, which may cause inconsistency or unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the original size value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.clear()` method is called, which removes all key-value pairs from the `_data` object, changing the state of the object and affecting any further operations that depend on the original data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_data.keys()` method is called, which returns an iterator for the keys of the `_data` object. This change would cause the 'load' event to receive an iterator instead of the size
