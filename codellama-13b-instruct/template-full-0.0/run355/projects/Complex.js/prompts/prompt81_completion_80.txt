  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check for a minus sign before the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check for a minus sign before the imaginary part of the complex number, and would instead check for a multiplication sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check for a minus sign before the imaginary part of the complex number, and would instead check for the letter "i" to indicate the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
