  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called `read` with the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort || true, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` or `true` argument, whereas the original code fragment only called `read` with the `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, whereas the original code fragment only called `read` with the `abort` argument.

DONE.
