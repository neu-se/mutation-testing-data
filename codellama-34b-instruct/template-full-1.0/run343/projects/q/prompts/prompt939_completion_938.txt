  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs + array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `baseArgs` array with the arguments passed to the function, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.concat(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `baseArgs` array with the `nodeArgs` array, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(array_slice(arguments))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the arguments passed to the function into the `baseArgs` array, which would result in a different output than the original code.

DONE.
