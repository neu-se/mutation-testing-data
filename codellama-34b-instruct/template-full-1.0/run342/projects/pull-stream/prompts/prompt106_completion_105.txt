  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called the `done` callback with an error object as the first argument, while the mutated code calls it with `null` as the first argument, which may not cause the expected behavior in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called the `done` callback with an error object as the first argument, while the mutated code calls it without any arguments, which may not cause the expected behavior in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code called the `done` callback immediately, while the mutated code calls it after a delay using `setTimeout`, which may cause the test suite to fail if it is not properly asynchronous.

DONE.
