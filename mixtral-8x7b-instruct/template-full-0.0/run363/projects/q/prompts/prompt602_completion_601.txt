 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method checks if the `object` is an instance of `Promise` and throws an error if it is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an object as the first argument, and an integer value would not have the necessary methods to continue the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects an object as the first argument, and a resolved promise would not have the necessary methods to continue the promise chain immediately. The actual object value would only be available in the next tick, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
