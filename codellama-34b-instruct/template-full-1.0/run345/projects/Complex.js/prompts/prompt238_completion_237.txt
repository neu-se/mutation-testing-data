  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'a' and 'b' to represent two different values, but the replaced code uses '-b' instead of 'b', which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'a' and 'b' to represent two different values, but the replaced code adds them together, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses 'b' to represent a value, but the replaced code uses '0' instead, which would cause the result of the calculation to be 0 regardless of the original values of 'a' and 'b'.

DONE.
