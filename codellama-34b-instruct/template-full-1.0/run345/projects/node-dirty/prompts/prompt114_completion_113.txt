  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`load_fail`
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and there may not be a listener for the `load_fail` event, which could cause the code to fail silently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`load_success`
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and there may not be a listener for the `load_success` event, which could cause the code to fail silently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`fail`
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and there may not be a listener for the `fail` event, which could cause the code to fail silently.

DONE.
