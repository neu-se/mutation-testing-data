  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && typeof reason.stack === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would incorrectly assume that `reason.stack` is not a function and not reject the promise if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && typeof reason.stack !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would incorrectly assume that `reason.stack` is not a function and not reject the promise if it is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason && reason.stack.name === "stack"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would incorrectly assume that `reason.stack` is not a function and not reject the promise if it is.

DONE.
