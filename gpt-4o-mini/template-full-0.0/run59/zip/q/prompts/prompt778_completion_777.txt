Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of inspecting the promise's state, it would always return `true`, leading to incorrect results when determining the state of the promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` method to be called with `undefined`, which may lead to unexpected errors or incorrect state information being returned for the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `"invalid"` instead of a valid argument would likely cause the `inspect` method to fail or return an unexpected result, thus affecting the overall behavior of the `allSettled` function.

DONE.
