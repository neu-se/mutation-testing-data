  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a non-null `retain` property, which would be missed with this replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a `retain` property with a truthy value, while this replacement checks for the presence of a `retain` property with a value of `object` and a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of a `retain` property with a value of `object`, while this replacement checks for the presence of a `retain` property with a truthy value.

DONE.
