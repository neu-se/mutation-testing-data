  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks is reversed, causing the `onRejected` callback to be called instead of the `onFulfilled` callback when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` callback is called instead of the `onRejected` callback when the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` callback is called instead of the `onFulfilled` callback when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
