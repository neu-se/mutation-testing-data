  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different object, and the `dispatch` method called on it would not be the same as the `dispatch` method called on the original `object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different function, and the `dispatch` method called on it would not be the same as the `dispatch` method called on the original `Q.dispatch` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Q.send
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different function, and the `dispatch` method called on it would not be the same as the `dispatch` method called on the original `Q.dispatch` function.

DONE.
