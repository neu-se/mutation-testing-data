  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a modified latitude value, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 180 - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a random latitude value, which would cause the calculation of the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
