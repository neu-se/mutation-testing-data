  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` variable, causing the `once` function to be called even if the `end` variable is not truthy. This could cause the `onEnd` callback to be called multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.
