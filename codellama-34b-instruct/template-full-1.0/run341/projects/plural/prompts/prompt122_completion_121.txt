  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i` matches words that end in "y" but not after a vowel, or end in "quy", but the replacement function `return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies'` would return the wrong plural form for words that end in "y" after a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ey' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i` matches words that end in "y"
