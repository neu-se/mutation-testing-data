 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortErr` would not be passed to the callback, and the error would not be properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned value would be a random number instead of a function, causing an error in the line `_read = stream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once.bind(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `once` function would be called immediately with the argument `true`, and its return value would be passed to the callback, instead of being used as a function to handle the next stream.

DONE.
