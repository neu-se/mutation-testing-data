  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` property is being referred to instead of the `im` property, which contains the imaginary part of the number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` property is being referred to instead of the `re` property, which contains the real part of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` property is being referred to as a property of the current object, but `this[0]` refers to the first element of an array.

DONE.
