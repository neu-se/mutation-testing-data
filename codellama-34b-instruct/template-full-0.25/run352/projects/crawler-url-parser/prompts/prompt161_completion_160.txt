  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality instead of loose equality, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part !== pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality instead of equality, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.length === pageurl_without_last_part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the two strings instead of their content, which could cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
