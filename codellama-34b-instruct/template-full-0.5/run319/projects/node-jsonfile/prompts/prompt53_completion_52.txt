  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, value) => value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original replacer function is used to modify the value of each key-value pair in the object, but this new replacer function simply returns the value unchanged, potentially resulting in a different stringified output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, value) => value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original replacer function is used to modify the value of each key-value pair in the object, but this new replacer function adds 1 to the value of each key-value pair, potentially resulting in a different stringified output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, value) => `${key}: ${value}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original replacer function is used to modify the value of each key-value pair in the object, but this new replacer function returns a string that concatenates the key and value of each
