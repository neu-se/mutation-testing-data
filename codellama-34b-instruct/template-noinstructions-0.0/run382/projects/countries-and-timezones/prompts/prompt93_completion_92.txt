  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it was passed as an argument or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `true`, regardless of whether it was passed as an argument or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `false`, regardless of whether it was passed as an argument or not.

DONE.
