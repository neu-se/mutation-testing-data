  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin()` returns the sine of an angle, while `Math.cos()` returns the cosine of an angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max()` returns the maximum of two numbers, while `Math.cos()` returns the cosine of an angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt()` returns the square root of a number, while `Math.cos()` returns the cosine of an angle.

DONE.
