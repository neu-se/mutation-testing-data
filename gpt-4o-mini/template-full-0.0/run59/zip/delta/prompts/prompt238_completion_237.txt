Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` will return the largest of the given values, which could lead to an incorrect operation length being used, potentially causing unexpected results in the `delete` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the length could cause the operation to attempt to delete more elements than intended, leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect state in the `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `thisIter.peekLength() + 1` could cause the deletion to exceed the available length of operations, potentially resulting in an error or unintended behavior in the `Delta` object.

DONE.
