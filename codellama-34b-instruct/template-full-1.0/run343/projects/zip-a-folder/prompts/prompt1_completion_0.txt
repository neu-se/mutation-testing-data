  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const foo = () => o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed;
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a new constant `foo` that always returns `true` regardless of the value of `o.compression`, and the test `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` will always pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression = COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high;
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `o.compression` to always be `COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high` instead of the original value, and the test `if (<PLACEHOLDER>)` will always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER> = !!o.compression;
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the boolified value of `o.compression` to
