  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the result is `false`, while this new code fragment checks whether the result is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the result is `false`, while this new code fragment checks whether the result is not `false`. This change would cause the `query` method to return `true` in cases where the original code would have returned `null`, which could lead to incorrect authorization decisions.
