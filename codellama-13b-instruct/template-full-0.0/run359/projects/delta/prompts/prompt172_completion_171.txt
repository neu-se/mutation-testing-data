  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `while` loop to iterate one more time than the original code, potentially causing the `delta` object to contain an extra operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `while` loop to iterate one fewer time than the original code, potentially causing the `delta` object to be missing an operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(thisIter.peekLength() / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor()` function would cause the `while` loop to iterate half as many times as the original code, potentially causing the `delta` object to be missing or containing extra operations.

DONE.
