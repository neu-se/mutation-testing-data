  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain.length` is a number, whereas `thisOp.retain` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain.length` is a number, whereas `otherOp.retain` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(thisOp.retain - otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs(thisOp.retain - otherOp.retain)` calculates the absolute difference between `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain`, whereas `thisOp.retain - otherOp.retain` calculates the relative difference.

DONE.
