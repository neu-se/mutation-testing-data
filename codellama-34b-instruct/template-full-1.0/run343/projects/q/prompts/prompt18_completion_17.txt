  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a keyword used to stop the execution of a function and return a value, while the original code fragment used `makeQ` to define a function and create a `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello World!");
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log("Hello World!")` would log a message to the console, while the original code fragment defined a function and created a `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong.");
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("Something went wrong.");` would throw an error, while the original code fragment defined a function and created a `Q` object.

DONE.
