  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it's undefined, while the replaced code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 and if it's not undefined. If `num` is undefined, the original code fragment would return the plural form, while the replaced code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 || num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it's undefined, while the replaced code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it's not undefined. If `num` is undefined, the original code fragment would return the plural form, while the replaced code fragment would return the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1 &&
