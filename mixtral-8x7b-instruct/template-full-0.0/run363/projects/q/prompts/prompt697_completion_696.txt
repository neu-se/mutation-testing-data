 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly uses `Array.prototype.slice` to convert the arguments object to an array, while the original code relies on the `<PLACEHOLDER>` which could be a polyfill for `array_slice` that handles non-array objects like `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of a newly created empty array, which would not have the polyfill for `array_slice` if it exists in the environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the first argument, whereas the original code slices the arguments object starting from the second element.

DONE.
