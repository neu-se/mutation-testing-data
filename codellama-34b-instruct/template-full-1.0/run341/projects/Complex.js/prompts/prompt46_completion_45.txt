  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in b && 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether 'im' is a property of the object 'b', not 'a', which is the original intention.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check only whether 'im' is a property of the object 'a', not both 'im' and 're'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!('re' in a) || !('im' in a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether 're' or 'im' is not a property of the object 'a', not both.

DONE.
