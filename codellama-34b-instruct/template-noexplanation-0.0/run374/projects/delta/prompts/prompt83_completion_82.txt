  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes

This will result in a different behavior than the original code, which only inserts a new operation if the attributes are different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === lastOp.attributes

This change will cause the `push` method to never insert a new operation, even if the attributes of the new operation are different from the attributes of the last operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes && newOp.insert !== lastOp.insert
```
This change will cause the `push` method to insert a new operation only if the attributes of the new operation are different from the
