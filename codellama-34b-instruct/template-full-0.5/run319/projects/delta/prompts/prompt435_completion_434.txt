  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to return a `retain` operation with a length greater than the length of the current operation, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to return a `retain` operation with a length less than the length of the current operation, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `next` method to return a `retain` operation with a length equal to the length of the current operation, which is not allowed by the original code.

DONE.
