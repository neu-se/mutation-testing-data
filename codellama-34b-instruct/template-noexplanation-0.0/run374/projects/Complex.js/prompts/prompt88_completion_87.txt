  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This change will cause the parser to skip the next token instead of the current one, which may cause the parser to misinterpret the input and produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This change will cause the parser to use the previous token instead of the current one, which may cause the parser to misinterpret the input and produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This change will cause the parser to use the current token multiplied by 2 instead of the current token, which may cause the parser to misinterpret the input and produce incorrect results.

DONE.
