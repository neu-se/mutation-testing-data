  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `invert` method to retain the wrong portion of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `invert` method to insert the wrong content into the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain(0)` is a different operation than `op.delete`, and it would cause the `invert` method to retain the wrong portion of the delta.

DONE.
