 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the callback function are swapped, which may cause issues if the order of arguments is important in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, 'extra')
