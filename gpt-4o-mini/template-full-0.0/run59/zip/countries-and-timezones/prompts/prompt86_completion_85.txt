Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` of the country instead of the country object itself, potentially leading to incorrect results when trying to retrieve country details.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `name` of the country instead of the country object, which may not be a valid input for the `getCountry` function, resulting in `undefined` or an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the country object, causing the `getCountry` function to fail to retrieve the correct country data and potentially return `null` or an error.

DONE.
