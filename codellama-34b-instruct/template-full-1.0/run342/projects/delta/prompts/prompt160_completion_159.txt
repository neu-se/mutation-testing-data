  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.peek(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would peek at the next operation in the other delta, rather than pushing the current operation into the list of changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation in the other delta into the list of changes, rather than just peeking at it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation in the current delta into the list of changes, rather than the next operation in the other delta.

DONE.
