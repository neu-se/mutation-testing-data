  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the message array starting from the second element, instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(["new message"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate a new message to the end of the message array, instead of returning the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the message array and return it, instead of returning the first element of the array.

DONE.
