  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `progress` variable as an argument to the `progressListener` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `progress` function with no arguments, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `message` variable as an argument to the `progress` function, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
