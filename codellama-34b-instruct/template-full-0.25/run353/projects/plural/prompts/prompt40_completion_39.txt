  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 3) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length argument, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length argument, which would result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring method is called with a different length argument, which would result in a different substring being returned.
