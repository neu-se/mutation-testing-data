  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the property name being accessed on the `point` object, potentially causing the code to fail if the property name is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a space to the property name, potentially causing the code to fail if the property name is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type' + '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a period to the property name, potentially causing the code to fail if the property name is not correct.

DONE.
