  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise) !== -1` was supposed to return `true`

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise) === -1` was supposed to return `true`

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport < reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `array_indexOf(reportedUnhandledRejections, promise) > reportedUnhandledRejections.length` was supposed to return `true`

DONE.
