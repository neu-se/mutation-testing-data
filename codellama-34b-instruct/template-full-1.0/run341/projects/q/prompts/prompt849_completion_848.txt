  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately reject the promise with the error, rather than waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately resolve the promise with the error, rather than waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the error, rather than waiting for the timeout to expire.

DONE.
