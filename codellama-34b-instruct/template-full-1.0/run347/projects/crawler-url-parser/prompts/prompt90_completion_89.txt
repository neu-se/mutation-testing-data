  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (true) return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code inside the `if` statement would be executed regardless of the value of `href`, causing the function to return `null` even if `href` is a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (href == -1) return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `href` is compared to `-1` instead of being checked for specific values or patterns. This could potentially cause the function to return `null` for invalid URLs, but it would also cause it to return `null` for legitimate URLs containing the substring "-1".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href = typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href) ? "http://example.com" : href;
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `href` is set
