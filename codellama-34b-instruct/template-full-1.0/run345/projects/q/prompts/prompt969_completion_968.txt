  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nfapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a different method from `npost`, and it takes a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nsend
```
This would result in different behavior because `nsend` is a different method from `npost`, and it takes a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a different method from `npost`, and it takes a different set of arguments.

DONE.
