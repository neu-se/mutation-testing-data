  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the negative of the `extractFilename` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename && options.dest.endsWith('.jpeg')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `options.dest` variable ends with '.jpeg' and `extractFilename` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png)$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace any .jpg, .jpeg, or .png extension with an empty string, effectively removing the extension from the `options.dest` variable.

DONE.
