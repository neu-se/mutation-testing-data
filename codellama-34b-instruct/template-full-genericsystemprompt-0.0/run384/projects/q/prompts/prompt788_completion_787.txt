  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a promise to be passed as an argument, but by replacing it with `null`, the function would receive a non-promise value, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a promise to be passed as an argument, but by replacing it with `undefined`, the function would receive a non-promise value, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a promise to be passed as an argument, but by replacing it with `0`, the function would receive a non-promise value, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
