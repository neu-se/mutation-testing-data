  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would be called, which would clear the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, potentially hiding unhandled rejections that should be reported.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `unhandledReasons` array, potentially hiding unhandled rejections that should be reported.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the `unhandledRejections` array, potentially hiding unhandled rejections that should be reported.

DONE.
