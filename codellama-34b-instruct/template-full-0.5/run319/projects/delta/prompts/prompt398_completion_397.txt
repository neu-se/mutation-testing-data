  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.clone()` creates a new object, whereas `otherOp` refers to the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.clone()` creates a new object, whereas `thisOp` refers to the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp`.

DONE.
