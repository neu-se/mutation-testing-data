  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to return a different result for complex numbers with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 1.

DONE.
