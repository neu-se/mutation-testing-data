  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` and `promise` variables are not defined in the current scope, and would throw a `ReferenceError` if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be used as the error object, which would cause the promise to be rejected immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, error
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` and `error` variables are swapped, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the error object instead of being rejected.

DONE.
