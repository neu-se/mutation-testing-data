  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push.apply(this, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because push.apply only works with arrays, while unshift works with any arguments. If the intended behavior of the code is to push an array with the same number of elements as `args`, this would alter the behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push.apply(this, args.concat(args))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push all the elements of `args` twice, which may be undesired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push.apply(this, args.slice(0, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only push the first element of `args`, while unshift would push all the elements.

DONE.
