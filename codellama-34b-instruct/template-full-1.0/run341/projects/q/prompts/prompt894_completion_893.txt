  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `args` variable, which is not a function and would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
varargs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `varargs` variable, which is not a function and would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `args` variable instead of calling `array_slice` with the original arguments.

DONE.
