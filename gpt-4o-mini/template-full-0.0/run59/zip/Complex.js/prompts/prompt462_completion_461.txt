Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `a` to be always greater than its original value, which could affect the string representation of the complex number when `b` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re'] - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the calculation of `a`, potentially leading to a non-zero value even when `this['re']` is zero, thus affecting the output of the `toString` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the imaginary part to `a`, which is supposed to represent the real part, leading to incorrect string representation of the complex number.

DONE.
