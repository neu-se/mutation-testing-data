  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecate
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecate` function is not defined in the code, and would cause an error when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved = allResolved;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allResolved` function is not defined in the code, and would cause an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled = allSettled;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function is not defined in the code, and would cause an error when called.

DONE.
