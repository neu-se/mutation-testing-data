  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array would be off by one, causing the wrong reason to be used in the `process.emit()` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array would be off by one, causing the wrong reason to be used in the `process.emit()` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons[at] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the reason would be off by one, causing the wrong reason to be used in the `process.emit()` call.

DONE.
