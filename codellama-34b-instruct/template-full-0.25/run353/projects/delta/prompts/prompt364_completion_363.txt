  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for 'insert' while this code checks for 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality while this code checks for greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of a next element while this code checks for the absence of a next element.

DONE.
