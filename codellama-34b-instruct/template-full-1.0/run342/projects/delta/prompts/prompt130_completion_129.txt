  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially accessing a nonexistent element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time, potentially missing an element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - index + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate two extra times, potentially accessing two nonexistent elements in the array.

DONE.
