  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(a, b).acosh()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `acosh` method of the `Complex` class, which computes the hyperbolic arc cosine of a complex number, while the new code fragment is using the `acosh` method of the `Math` class, which computes the hyperbolic arc cosine of a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(a, b).atanh()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `atanh` method of the `Complex` class, which computes the hyperbolic arc tangent of a complex number, while the new code fragment is using the `atanh` method of the `Math` class, which computes the hyperbolic arc tangent of a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(a, b).acsch()
