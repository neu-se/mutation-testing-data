  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, while the buggy code fragment creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, but with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, while the buggy code fragment creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, but with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, while the buggy code fragment creates a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, but with a different
