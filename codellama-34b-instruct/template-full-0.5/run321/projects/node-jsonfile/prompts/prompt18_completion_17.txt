  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the file contents directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the file contents directly, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync('./foo.json')
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` expects a file path as an argument, whereas `fs.readFile` expects a file descriptor.

DONE.
