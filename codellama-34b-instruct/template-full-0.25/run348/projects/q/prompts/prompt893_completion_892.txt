  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not defined, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not null, and the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is not a function, and the code would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
