  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `.fail` method that was not being called in the buggy code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `.fail` method that was not being called in the buggy code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a `.fail` method that was not being called in the buggy code fragment.

DONE.
