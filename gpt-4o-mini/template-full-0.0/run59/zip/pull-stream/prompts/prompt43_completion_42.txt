Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `ref` array, which means any modifications to `ref` after this point will not affect the array passed to the `pull` function, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.concat([read])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array by concatenating `ref` with an array containing `read`, which changes the original reference and alters the arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the elements in the `ref` array before passing it to the `pull` function, which could change the sequence in which the arguments are processed, leading to different outcomes.

DONE.
