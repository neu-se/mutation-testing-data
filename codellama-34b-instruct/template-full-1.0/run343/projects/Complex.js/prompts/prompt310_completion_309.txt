  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```math.pi * 2```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate twice the value of pi, which is 6.283185, instead of twice the value of 2, which is 4.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a * b```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of a and b instead of the product of a and 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b * a```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of b and a instead of the product of a and 2.

DONE.
