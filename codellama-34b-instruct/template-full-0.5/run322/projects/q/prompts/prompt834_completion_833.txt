  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a variable named "progress" which is not used, while the replacement code fragment has a variable named "progressed" which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a variable named "progress" which is not used, while the replacement code fragment has a variable named "progress" which is used as a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, Q.progress()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a variable named "progress" which is not used, while the replacement code fragment has a variable named "progress" which is used as a function.

DONE.
