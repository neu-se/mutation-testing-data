  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.slice()` creates a new array containing the elements of `verbs`, whereas `verbs` is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.filter(v => v)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.filter(v => v)` creates a new array containing only the truthy elements of `verbs`, whereas `verbs` contains all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.map(v => !v)
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.map(v => !v)` creates a new array containing the negated elements of `verbs`, whereas `verbs` contains the original elements.

DONE.
