Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('The options.url is missing')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is different, which may not be caught by tests that check for specific error messages.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('URL is required'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is simplified and may not match the expected error message in the test cases, potentially causing tests to pass when they should fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('URL is not provided')
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects with a string instead of an Error object, which could lead to tests that expect an Error to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
