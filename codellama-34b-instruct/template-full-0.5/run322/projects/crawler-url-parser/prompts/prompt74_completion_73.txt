  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').replace(/^https?:\/\/[^\/]+/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to remove the protocol and domain from the base URL, while the suggested code fragment only removes the protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to remove the last part of the base URL, while the suggested code fragment uses array methods to remove the last part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href').replace(/[^\/]+$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to remove the last part of the base URL, while the suggested code fragment only removes the last part.

DONE.
