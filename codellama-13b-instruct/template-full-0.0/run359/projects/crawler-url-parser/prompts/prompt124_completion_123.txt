  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let parsedUrl = URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function is called with the `currentUrlStr` argument, which is a string, instead of the `currentUrl` argument, which is an object. This would cause the `parsedUrl` object to be created with the `currentUrlStr` string as the `url` property, instead of the `currentUrl` object as the `url` property.
