  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set()` would attempt to set a property on `null`, which would result in a `TypeError` exception, whereas the original code would attempt to set a property on the resolved value of `Q(object)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set()` would attempt to set a property on `object.length`, which would result in a `TypeError` exception if `object.length` is not a reference type, whereas the original code would attempt to set a property on the resolved value of `Q(object)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{a: 1}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set()` would attempt to set a property on `{a: 1}`, which would result in a `TypeError` exception, whereas the original code would attempt to set a property on the resolved value of `
