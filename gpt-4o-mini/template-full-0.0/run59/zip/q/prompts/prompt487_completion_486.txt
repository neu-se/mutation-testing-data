Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly reset the unhandled rejections even when tracking is disabled, potentially leading to loss of information about unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument would not reset the unhandled rejections correctly, as the function expects no arguments to reset the internal state properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections();
trackUnhandledRejections = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would re-enable tracking of unhandled rejections after it has been stopped, which could lead to inconsistent state management in the promise library.

DONE.
