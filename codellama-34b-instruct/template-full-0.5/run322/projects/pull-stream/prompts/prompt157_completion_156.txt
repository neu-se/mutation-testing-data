  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_value` variable is not the same as the `value` variable, and the `cb` function is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the wrong arguments, and the `value` variable is not updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the wrong arguments, and the `value` variable is not updated.

DONE.
