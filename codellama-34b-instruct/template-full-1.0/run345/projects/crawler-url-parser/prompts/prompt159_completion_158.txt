  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because empty string is not the same as null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "(space)
```
This would result in different behavior because a space is not the same as a newline.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\".
```
This would result in different behavior because a backslash is not the same as a newline.

DONE.
