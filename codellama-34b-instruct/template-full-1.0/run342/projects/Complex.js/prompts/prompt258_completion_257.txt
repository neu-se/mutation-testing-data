  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 && b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of the operations, which can potentially change the result of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition in the second clause from `a > 0` to `a >= 0`, which allows for the possibility that `a` might be equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logical operation from `&&` to `||`, which changes the behavior of the entire expression.

DONE.
