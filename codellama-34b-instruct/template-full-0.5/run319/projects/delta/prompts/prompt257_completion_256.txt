  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNotEqual` function is not defined, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(other, this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function is called with the arguments reversed, which could cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
