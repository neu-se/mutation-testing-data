  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which is the input to the function. This would cause the function to behave differently when `end` is true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to true if `end` is true and `test(data)` is true. This would cause the function to behave differently when `end` is false or when `test(data)` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end || test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only set `ended` to true if `end` is true or `test(data)` is true. This would cause the function to behave differently when `end` is false or when `test(data)` is false.

DONE.
