  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.call(arguments, 1)` is a different function than `array_slice`, and it would cause the `fcall` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(this, 1)` is a different function than `array_slice`, and it would cause the `fcall` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(this, [1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.apply(this, [1])` is a different function than `array_slice`, and it would cause the `fcall` method to behave differently.

DONE.
