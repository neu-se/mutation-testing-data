  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the filter to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with no arguments, which may cause it to return a different result than when it is called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is being called with the wrong `this` context, which may cause it to return a different result than when it is called with the correct context.

DONE.
