  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = prop(field) || id
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a function that returns the value of the property with the given name, while `id` is a function that returns its argument unchanged. In the original code, `field` is expected to be a function, so replacing it with `prop(field)` would cause the code to fail if `field` is not a property name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = field + 1 || id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `field` function to be called with a different argument, which could change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field = field * 2 || id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `field` function to be called with a different argument, which could change its behavior.

DONE.
