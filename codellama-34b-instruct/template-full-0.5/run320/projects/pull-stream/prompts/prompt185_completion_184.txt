  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` for all array elements, while the new code fragment returns `false` for all array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` for all array elements, while the new code fragment returns the element itself for all array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` for all array elements, while the new code fragment returns `true` for all array elements except the last one.

DONE.
