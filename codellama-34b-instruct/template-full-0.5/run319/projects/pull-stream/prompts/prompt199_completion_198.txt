  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the function to return an error, while the new code fragment `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the function to return an error, while the new code fragment `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` would cause the function to return an error, while the new code fragment `0` would cause the function to return `0` instead.

DONE.
