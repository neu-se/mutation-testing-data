  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment included the STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR, which is a constant defined earlier in the code as "From previous event:". The new code fragment only includes a newline character, which would not include the separator and could result in different stack trace behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment included the STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR, which is a constant defined earlier in the code as "From previous event:". The new code fragment includes the separator, but it is not followed by a newline character, which could result in different stack trace behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment included the STACK
