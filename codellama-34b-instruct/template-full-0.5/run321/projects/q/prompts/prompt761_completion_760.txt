  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(0, promises.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would only be applied to the first `n - 1` elements of the `promises` array, where `n` is the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would be applied to a new array that is a concatenation of the `promises` array and an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function (promise) { return promise !== undefined; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_map` function would only be applied to the non-undefined elements of the `promises` array.

DONE.
