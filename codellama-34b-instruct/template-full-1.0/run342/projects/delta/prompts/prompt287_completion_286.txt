  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.delete != null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` is only defined for deletion operations, and would lead to the code that deletes the retain operation being skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp.retain != null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is only defined for retain operations, and would lead to the code that deletes the retain operation being skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.retain != null && otherOp.retain != null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require both operations to have a retain property, and would lead to the code that deletes the retain operation being skipped.

DONE.
