  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate the iterator more times than necessary, potentially resulting in a infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate the iterator one time less than necessary, potentially resulting in a missed iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate the iterator one time more than necessary, potentially resulting in additional iterations that may be unnecessary.

DONE.
