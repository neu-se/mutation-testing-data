 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Unhandled error") }
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error immediately instead of binding the `onUnhandledError` function to the process domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the `onerror` property of the `Q` object instead of binding the `onUnhandledError` function to the process domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error("Unhandled error") }.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it binds the newly created function to the current context, which might not have the expected behavior in the context of the `Q` library.

DONE.
