  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same inputs. `Math.tan` returns the tangent of the argument in radians, whereas `Math.cos` returns the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(Math.abs(Math.pow(a, 2) + Math.pow(b, 2)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment calculates the hypotenuse of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment calculates the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(Math.tanh(a) * Math.tan(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because the code fragment calculates the arctangent of the hypotenuse of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment calculates the cosine.

DONE.
