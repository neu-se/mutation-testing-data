  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a resolver function, while `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a resolver function, while `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a resolver function, while `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` is a function call that returns a resolver function with a `null` argument.

DONE.
