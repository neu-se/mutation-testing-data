  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is not being applied to the difference between `z['im']` and `this['im']`, which could result in a negative value being passed to the `Math.abs` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function is being applied to the difference between `z['im']` and `this['im']`, which could result in a positive value being passed to the `Math.abs` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) === Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.abs` function
