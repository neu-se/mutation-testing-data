  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would fulfill the promise instead of rejecting it, which could cause the promise chain to execute a different code path than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would update the progress of the promise and potentially execute the progress handler, but it would not affect the resolution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q` is a promise library, and using it as a placeholder would cause the promise chain to enter a different branch.

DONE.
