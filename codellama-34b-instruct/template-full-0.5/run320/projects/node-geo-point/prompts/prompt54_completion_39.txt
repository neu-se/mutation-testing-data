  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are different trigonometric functions with different outputs for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` have different ranges and outputs for the same input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse functions of each other, so the output of `acos` would be the inverse of the output of `cos`, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
