  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is always greater than or equal to 0, so the `while` loop would never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an object is always greater than or equal to 0, so the `while` loop would execute indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop would iterate one fewer times than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
