  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would no longer have access to the `baseOp` variable, which it uses to retrieve the attributes for the embed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would no longer have access to the `baseOp` variable, which it uses to retrieve the attributes for the embed. Additionally, using an empty object as a placeholder would likely cause errors in the `transform` method, as it assumes that the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ someProperty: 'someValue' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would no longer have access to the `baseOp` variable, which it uses to retrieve the attributes for the embed. Additionally, using a non-empty object as a placeholder would likely cause errors in the `transform`
