  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a)` would return the exponential function of `a`, whereas `Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b)` would return the product of the exponential function of `a` and the sine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(a)` would return the sine of `a`, whereas `Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b)` would return the product of the exponential function of `a` and the sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(a)` would return the cosine of `a`, whereas `Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b)` would return the product of the exponential function of `
