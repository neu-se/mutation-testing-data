 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method called on the resolved promise may return a different object, causing the `nearer` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { resolve(value); })
