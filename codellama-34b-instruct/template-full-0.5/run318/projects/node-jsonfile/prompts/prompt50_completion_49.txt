  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not guaranteed to exist in the `options` object, and if it doesn't, the function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.throws
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throws` property is not guaranteed to exist in the `options` object, and if it doesn't, the function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is not guaranteed to exist in the `options` object, and if it doesn't, the function would throw an error.

DONE.
