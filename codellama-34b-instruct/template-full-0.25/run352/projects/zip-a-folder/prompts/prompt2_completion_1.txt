  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: true,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `archiverOptions` object is not being passed to the `compress` method, which means that the compression level will not be set correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: false,
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is being set to `false`, which means that the archive will not be compressed.

Option 3: The PLACE
