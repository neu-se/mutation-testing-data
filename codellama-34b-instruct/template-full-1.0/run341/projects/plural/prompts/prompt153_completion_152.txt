  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would always return the word `s` instead of the correct plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`num - 1`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would always return the word `s` if the number is greater than 1, instead of the correct plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`num + 1`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would always return the word `s` if the number is less than 2, instead of the correct plural form.
