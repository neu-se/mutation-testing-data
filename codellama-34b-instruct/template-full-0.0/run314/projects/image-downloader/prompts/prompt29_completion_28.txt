  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be assigned to the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause the request to be sent over an unencrypted connection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'httpss'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be assigned to a non-existent module, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `request` variable would be assigned to the `http` module concatenated with the string `'s'`, which would result in the string `'https'`.

DONE.
