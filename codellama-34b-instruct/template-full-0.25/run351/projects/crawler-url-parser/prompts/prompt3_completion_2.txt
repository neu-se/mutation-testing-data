  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` checks if the variable `currentUrlStr` is undefined, while `currentUrlStr === null` checks if it is null. If the variable is null, the code would still execute the `if` block, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof currentUrlStr === 'undefined'` checks if the variable `currentUrlStr` is undefined, while `currentUrlStr === undefined` checks if it is undefined. If the variable is undefined, the code would still execute the `if` block, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
