  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the array slice() method will have a different starting index, leading to a different range of elements being passed to the "post" method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the array slice() method will have a negative starting index, leading to an empty array being passed to the "post" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(Math.random() < 0.5) {
  0
} else {
  1
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the array slice() method will have a random starting index, leading to a random range of elements being passed to the "post" method.

DONE.
