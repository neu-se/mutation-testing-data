  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the empty string to indicate that the last part of the URL should be removed, while the new code would remove the first part instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the empty string to indicate that the last part of the URL should be removed, while the new code would remove the first part instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the empty string to indicate that the last part of the URL should be removed, while the new code would remove the first part instead.

DONE.
