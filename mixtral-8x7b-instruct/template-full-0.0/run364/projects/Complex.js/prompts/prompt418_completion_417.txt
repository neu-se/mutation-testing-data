 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity, regardless of the input's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isZero
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return undefined, causing the function to return Complex.INFINITY without checking the input's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Complex.INFINITY, even when the input is not zero.

DONE.
