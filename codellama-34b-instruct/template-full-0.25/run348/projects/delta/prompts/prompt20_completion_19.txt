  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the order of the objects being compared, which could lead to different results in the `diff` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the `key` property of the `b` object to the value of the `key` property of the `a` object, rather than comparing the values of the `key` properties of the two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the `key` property of the `a` object to the value of the `key` property of the `b` object, rather than comparing the values of the `key` properties of the two objects.

DONE.
