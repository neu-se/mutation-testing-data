  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` and `Math.ceil` have different rounding behavior for negative numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` and `Math.ceil` have different behavior for negative numbers.

DONE.
