  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on `self` with the `error` object, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the `error` object as the reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(new Error(error))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new `Error` object with the `error` object as the message, and then call the `reject` method on `self` with the new `Error` object as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject(error.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `reject` method on `self` with the `error.message` string as the reason.

DONE.
