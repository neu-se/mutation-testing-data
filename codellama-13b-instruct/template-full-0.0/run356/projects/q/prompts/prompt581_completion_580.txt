  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "send" operator would cause the generator to continue executing, whereas the "throw" operator would cause the generator to stop executing and propagate the error to the error handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"next"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "next" operator would cause the generator to continue executing, whereas the "throw" operator would cause the generator to stop executing and propagate the error to the error handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "return" operator would cause the generator to stop executing and return a value, whereas the "throw" operator would cause the generator to stop executing and propagate the error to the error handler.

DONE.
