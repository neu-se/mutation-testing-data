  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the country instead of the country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].timezones[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first timezone of the country instead of the country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].allTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return all the timezones of the country instead of the country object.

DONE.
