 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/index\\.[a-z]+$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash before the dot is escaped, making it a literal dot instead of a regex wildcard.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.\w+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because `\w` matches any word character (equivalent to `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`), instead of just lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]+\/*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the trailing slash is optional, allowing for matches like "/index.html/" and "/index.html".

DONE.
