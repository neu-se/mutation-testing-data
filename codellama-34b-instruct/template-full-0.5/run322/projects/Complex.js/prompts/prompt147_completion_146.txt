  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNan` checks for `NaN` values, while `isInfinite` checks for `Infinity` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks for finite values, while `isInfinite` checks for `Infinity` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re']` is the real part of the complex number, and `Infinity` is a constant representing infinity.

DONE.
