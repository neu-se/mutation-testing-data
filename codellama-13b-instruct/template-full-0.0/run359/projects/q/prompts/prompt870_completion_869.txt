  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as the arguments to the `nfapply` method, rather than passing the `args` array as the arguments to the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array as the argument to the `nfapply` method, rather than passing the `args` array as the arguments to the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `args` array as the argument to the `nfapply` method, rather than passing the `args` array as the arguments to the `callback` function.

DONE.
