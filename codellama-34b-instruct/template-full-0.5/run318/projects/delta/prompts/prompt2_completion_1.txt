  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would check if `b` is null, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === undefined` would check if `b` is undefined, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === NaN` would check if `b` is NaN, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
