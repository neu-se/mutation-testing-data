  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections` is always truthy, so the `untrackRejection` function would never be called, leading to a memory leak.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `!trackUnhandledRejections` is always falsy, so the `untrackRejection` function would always be called, leading to unnecessary processing and potential bugs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `trackUnhandledRejections === false` would only be true if `trackUnhandledRejections` is explicitly set to `false`, otherwise it would always be truthy, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
