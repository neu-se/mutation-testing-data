  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the `promise` is present in the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `unhandledReasons` array instead of checking if the `promise` is present in the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
