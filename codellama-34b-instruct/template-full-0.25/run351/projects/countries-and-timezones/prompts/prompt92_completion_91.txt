  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the ID of `countryId + 1`, rather than the country with the ID of `countryId`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the ID of `countryId - 1`, rather than the country with the ID of `countryId`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the country with the ID of `countryId * 2`, rather than the country with the ID of `countryId`.

DONE.
