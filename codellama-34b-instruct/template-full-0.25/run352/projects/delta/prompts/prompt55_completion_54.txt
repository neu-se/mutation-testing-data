  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for `ops`, as `ops` is an object and not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(ops).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for `ops`, as `ops` is an object with keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.hasOwnProperty('ops')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for `ops`, as `ops` is an object with a property called `ops`.

DONE.
