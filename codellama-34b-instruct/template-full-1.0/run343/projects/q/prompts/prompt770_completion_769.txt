  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when one of the promises in an array is resolved, while `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in an array are resolved, while `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a function that returns a promise that is fulfilled when all of the promises in an array are resolved or rejected, while `this` is a keyword that refers to the current object.

DONE.
