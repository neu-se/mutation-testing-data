  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && !Array.isArray(object.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property, while this new code fragment additionally checks if `object.coordinates` is not an array. If `object.coordinates` is an array, the new code fragment would return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject && object.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `object` is an object and has a `coordinates` property with exactly 2 elements, while this new code fragment additionally checks if the length of `object.coordinates` is less than 2. If the length of `object.coordinates` is less than 2, the new code fragment would return `false`, while the original code fragment would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACE
