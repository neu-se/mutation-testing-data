  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if `point` has a property `coordinates`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `coordinates` has a property `type`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
radius
```
This would result in different behavior because `radius` is a constant and its value may not be what the developers expected.

DONE.
