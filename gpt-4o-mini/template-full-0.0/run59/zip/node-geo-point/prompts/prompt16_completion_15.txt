Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLatLngArray(point.coordinates);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls `fromLatLngArray` instead of the intended `fromLngLatArray`, which may lead to unexpected results if the method is not defined or behaves differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[1], point.coordinates[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the latitude and longitude values, which would create a `GeoPoint` with incorrect geographic coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(point.coordinates[0] + 1, point.coordinates[1] + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to both the latitude and longitude values, which would incorrectly shift the geographic location by one degree in both directions.

DONE.
