  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the result of the generator, rather than the value of the yield expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the result of the generator, rather than the value of the yield expression, and would also add 1 to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value).then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the result of the generator, rather than the value of the yield expression, and would also multiply the result by 2.

DONE.
