 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the `.trim()` function, which may cause the extracted text to include leading or trailing whitespaces.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).attr('href').replace(/;.*$/, '') || ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty string when the `href` attribute is empty or not present, whereas the original code returns `undefined`. This change may affect further processing of the extracted URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).find('text')[0].data.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that the anchor tag contains a child `<text>` element, which is not the case in the original code. This change would cause the function to return `undefined` for all anchor tags without a child `<text>` element.
