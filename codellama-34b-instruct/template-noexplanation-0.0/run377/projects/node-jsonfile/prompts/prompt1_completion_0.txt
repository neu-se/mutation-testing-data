  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `options`. This will result in the `options` object being overwritten with a new object containing only the `encoding` property, which may cause the function to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'string'
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is equal to the string `'string'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding === 'utf8'

This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only if the `encoding` property of the `options` object is equal to
