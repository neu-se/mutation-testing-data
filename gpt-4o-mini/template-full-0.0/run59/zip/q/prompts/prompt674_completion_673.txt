Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [null, args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the `dispatch` method from `undefined` to `null`, which may affect how the target function interprets the context (`this`) when it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.invoke("apply", args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from `dispatch` to `invoke`, which may not exist or behave differently, leading to potential errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("apply", [void 0, []]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from `args` (which contains the actual arguments) to an empty array, meaning that the function will be called with no arguments instead of the intended ones.

DONE.
