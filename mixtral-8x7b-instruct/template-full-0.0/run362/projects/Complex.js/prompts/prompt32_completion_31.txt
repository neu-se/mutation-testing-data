 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this change checks if `a` is greater than 0. This would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is positive and `b` is 0, instead of throwing a `SyntaxError` as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this change checks if the reciprocal of `a` is equal to 0. This would cause the function to return `Math.log(_b)` when `a` is non-zero and its reciprocal is 0 (i.e., when `a` is infinity), instead of throwing a `SyntaxError` as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
