  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the angular distance between two points using the sine of the angular distance, while this code fragment calculates it using the cosine. This could lead to different results when calculating the destination point or the bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the angular distance between two points using the sine of the angular distance, while this code fragment calculates it using the sine. This could lead to different results when calculating the destination point or the bearing between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(δ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the angular distance between two points using the sine of the angular distance, while this code fragment calculates it using the tangent. This could lead to different results when calculating the destination point or the bearing
