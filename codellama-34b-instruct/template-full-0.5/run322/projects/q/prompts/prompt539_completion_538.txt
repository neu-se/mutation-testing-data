  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the array of promises instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first promise in the array instead of the fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return array.map(function(promise) { return promise.inspect(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of promises instead of the fulfilled value.

DONE.
