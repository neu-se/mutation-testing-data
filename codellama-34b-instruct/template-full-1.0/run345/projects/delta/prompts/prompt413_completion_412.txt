  Sure, here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code changes the `offset` variable only if the iterator has a non-zero length, and it would not increment `index` accordingly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code changes the `offset` variable only if the iterator has a zero length, and it would increment `index` by the length of the current op instead of by the number of ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code increments `index` only if the other iterator has a non-zero length, and it would not consider the length of the current op.

DONE.
