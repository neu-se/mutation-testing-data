  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'unknown'` event is not handled by the code, and it would cause an error when the event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'finish'` event is not handled by the code, and it would cause an error when the event is emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'end'` event is not handled by the code, and it would cause an error when the event is emitted.

DONE.
