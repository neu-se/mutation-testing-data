  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(99).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(99)` is a resolved promise with the value `99`, whereas `Q(object)` is a resolved promise with the value of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(undefined).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` is a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, whereas `Q(object)` is a resolved promise with the value of the `object` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null).inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` is a resolved promise with the value `null`, whereas `Q(object)` is a resolved promise with the value of the `object` variable.

DONE.
