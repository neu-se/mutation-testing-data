  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'END'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs, but the `'END'` event is emitted when the file stream ends, but the file has not been parsed or processed yet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'parse_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs, but the `'parse_error'` event is emitted when an error occurs while parsing the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'processing_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when an error occurs, but the `'processing_error'` event is emitted when an error occurs while processing the file.

DONE.
