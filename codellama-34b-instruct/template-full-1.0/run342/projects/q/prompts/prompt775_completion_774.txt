  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise, while `Q.all` is a function that returns an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise, while `Q.when` creates a fulfilled promise with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise, while `Q.when` creates a fulfilled promise with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
