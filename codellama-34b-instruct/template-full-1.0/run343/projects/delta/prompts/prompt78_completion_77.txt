  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional checks if `newOp.delete` is a string, but the original code fragment checks if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'boolean' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional checks if `newOp.delete` is a boolean, but the original code fragment checks if it is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'undefined' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional checks if `newOp.delete` is undefined, but the original code fragment checks if it is a number.

DONE.
