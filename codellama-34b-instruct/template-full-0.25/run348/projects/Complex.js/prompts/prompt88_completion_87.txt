  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next token instead of using the next token as the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the previous token instead of the next token as the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the imaginary part instead of using it as is.

DONE.
