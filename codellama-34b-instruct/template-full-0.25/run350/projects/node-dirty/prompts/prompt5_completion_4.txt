  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be concatenated with the string '1', which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be concatenated with the string 'a', which would cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than the one provided.

DONE.
