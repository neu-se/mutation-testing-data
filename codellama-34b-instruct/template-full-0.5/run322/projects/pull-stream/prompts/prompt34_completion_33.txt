  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` element is not the same as `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[2]` element is not the same as `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.length` is not the same as `ref[0]`.

DONE.
