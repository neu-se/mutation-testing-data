  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the `inspect` property, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method and return the state of the promise, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `then` method and return the state of the promise, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
