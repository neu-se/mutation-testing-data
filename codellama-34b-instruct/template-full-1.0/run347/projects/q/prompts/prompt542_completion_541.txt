  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method would always return an empty array instead of the expected value.

DONE.
