Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the test function to always return true, causing the filter to pass all data regardless of its actual content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return data === null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the test function to only pass data that is strictly equal to null, which is likely not the intended filtering behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return !data; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the test function to return true for falsy values (like 0, "", null, undefined, etc.), potentially allowing unwanted data to pass through the filter.

DONE.
