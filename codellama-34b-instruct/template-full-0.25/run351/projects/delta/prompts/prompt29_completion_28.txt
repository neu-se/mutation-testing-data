  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert()` is a function that returns the inverse of the `base` object, whereas `base` is an object that contains the attributes to be transformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.clone()` is a function that returns a shallow copy of the `base` object, whereas `base` is an object that contains the attributes to be transformed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.transform()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.transform()` is a function that transforms the `base` object, whereas `base` is an object that contains the attributes to be transformed.

DONE.
