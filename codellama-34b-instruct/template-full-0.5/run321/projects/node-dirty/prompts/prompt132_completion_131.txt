  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.entries().next().value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first entry in the queue, rather than all entries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first entry from the queue, rather than considering all entries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first entry from the queue, rather than considering all entries.

DONE.
