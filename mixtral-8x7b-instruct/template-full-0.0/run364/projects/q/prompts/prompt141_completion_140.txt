 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would not be accessed, and instead `null` would be passed to the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because an integer would be passed to the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function instead of an object, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.source
```
This would result in different behavior because a string would be used instead of the `p` object, and the `source` property of the string does not exist, which would cause an error.

DONE.
