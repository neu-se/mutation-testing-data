  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to always receive the value 42 as the second argument, regardless of the value of `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to always receive `null` as the second argument, regardless of the value of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `apply` method to receive the length of the `args` array as the second argument, regardless of the value of `args`.

DONE.
