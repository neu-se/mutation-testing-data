  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the value is `NaN`, while `!isNaN` returns `false` if the value is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` if the value is a finite number, while `isNaN` returns `true` if the value is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a function that returns `true` if the value is `NaN`, while `isNaN` is a function that returns `true` if the value is `NaN` or `Infinity`.

DONE.
