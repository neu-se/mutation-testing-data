  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { x: 0, y: 0 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same tile, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { x: Math.random(), y: Math.random() };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random tile each time, making it difficult to predict the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { x: -1, y: -1 };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a tile that is outside the bounds of the map, causing an error.

DONE.
