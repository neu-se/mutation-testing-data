  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the function to return the finalised pattern, regardless of whether the path ends with a slash or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
endWithSlash ? finalise(true) : finalise(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would conditionally finalise the pattern based on whether the path ends with a slash or not, which is the opposite of the original implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the non-finalised pattern, regardless of whether the path ends with a slash or not.

DONE.
