  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `callback` is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not the string `"undefined"`.

DONE.
