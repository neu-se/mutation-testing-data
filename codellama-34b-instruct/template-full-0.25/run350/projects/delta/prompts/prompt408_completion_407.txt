  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the first element of the delta, whereas the original code fragment would chop the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the first element of the delta, whereas the original code fragment would chop the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(delta.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the last element of the delta, whereas the original code fragment would chop the delta.

DONE.
