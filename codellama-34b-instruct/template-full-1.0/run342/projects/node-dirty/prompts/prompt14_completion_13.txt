  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because the shift() method removes the first element of an array and returns that removed element, whereas the push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because the pop() method removes the last element of an array and returns that removed element, whereas the push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because the unshift() method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array, whereas the push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

DONE.
