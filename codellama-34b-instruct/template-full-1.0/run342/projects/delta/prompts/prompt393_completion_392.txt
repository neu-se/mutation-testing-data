  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the number of iterations in the `while` loop, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next  !== otherIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the next value in the iterator with the current value, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter. peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the next value in the iterator with the current value, potentially resulting in a different output.
DONE.
