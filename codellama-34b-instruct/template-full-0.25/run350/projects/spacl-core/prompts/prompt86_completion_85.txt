  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with `deep` set to `false`, which will create a shallow copy of the `rule` object instead of a deep copy. This could cause issues if the `rule` object contains references to other objects, as the shallow copy would still point to the same objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with `deep` set to `true`, which will create a deep copy of the `rule` object. This could cause issues if the `rule` object contains circular references, as the deep copy could result in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, !deep)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is called with `deep` set to the opposite of its original
