  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `output` is a WriteStream and `null` is not. This replacement would cause the `zipArchive.pipe()` method to fail because it is not being piped to a valid writable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `output` is a WriteStream and `undefined` is not. This replacement would cause the `zipArchive.pipe()` method to fail because it is not being piped to a valid writable stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output` is a WriteStream and `output.toString()` is a string representation of the WriteStream object. This replacement would cause the `zipArchive.pipe()` method to fail because it is not being piped to a valid writable stream.

DONE.
