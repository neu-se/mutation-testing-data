  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsey value, which means it would evaluate to `false` in a boolean context, but `task` is truthy and would evaluate to `true` in a boolean context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value, but `task` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"<PLACEHOLDER>"` is truthy, but `task` may be either truthy or falsey depending on its value.

DONE.
