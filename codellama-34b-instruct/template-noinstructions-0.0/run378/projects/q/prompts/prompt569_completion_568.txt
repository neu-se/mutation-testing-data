  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a function that takes an error as an argument and returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `errback` is a function that takes an error as an argument and returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a function that throws an error, whereas `errback` is a function that takes an error as an argument and returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
