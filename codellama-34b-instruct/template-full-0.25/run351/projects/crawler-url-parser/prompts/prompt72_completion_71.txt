  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `attr` method returns the value of the specified attribute, which is not the same as the `href` property of the `base` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` method returns the value of the specified property, which is not the same as the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is not the same as the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

DONE.
