  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator (`&`) will return a different value than the bitwise OR operator (`|`) in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` constant is not being checked in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` constant is not being checked in the original code fragment.

DONE.
