  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable is initialized to `true` and is only set to `false` in the `Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function is only called if `process` is an object and has an `emit` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array is only checked if it is not empty.

DONE.
