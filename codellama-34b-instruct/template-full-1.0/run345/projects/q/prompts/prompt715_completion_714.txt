  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.reverse()` would return a reversed array, while `object` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object[0]` would return the first element of the array, while `object` would return the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `object + 1` would return the array plus one, which is not a valid operation.

DONE.
