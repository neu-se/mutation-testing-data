  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` expects a file path as its first argument, whereas `zipArchive.directory` expects a directory path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.glob` expects a glob pattern as its first argument, whereas `zipArchive.directory` expects a directory path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.finalize` is a method that finalizes the archive, whereas `zipArchive.directory` is a method that adds a directory to the archive.

DONE.
