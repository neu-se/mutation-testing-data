  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a promise that is resolved with the original `promises` array, rather than a promise that is resolved with an array of the resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a promise that is rejected with the original `promises` array, rather than a promise that is resolved with an array of the resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function would return a promise that is resolved with an array of the resolved values, but would also notify the progress of the promises in the `promises` array.

DONE.
