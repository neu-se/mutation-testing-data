  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `null` is a null value. The error object is used to indicate that an error has occurred, while null is used to indicate that no error has occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `undefined` is a value that indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `err` is an error object, while `new Error()` creates a new error object.

DONE.
