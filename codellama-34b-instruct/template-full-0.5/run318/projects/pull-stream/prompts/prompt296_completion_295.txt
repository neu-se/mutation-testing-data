  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is applied to `ended` and `end`, which would cause the code to always return `true` if `ended` is `true`, regardless of the value of `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the code to return `true` if either `ended` or `!end` is `true`, rather than requiring both conditions to be `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the code to return `true` if both `ended` and `end` are `true`, rather than requiring either condition to be `true`.

DONE.
