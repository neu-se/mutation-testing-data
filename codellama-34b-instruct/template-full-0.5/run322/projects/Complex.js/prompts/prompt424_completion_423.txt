  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isInfinite']`, potentially causing the `if` statement to evaluate to a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` would check if the complex number is finite, whereas `this['isInfinite']` would check if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` would check if the complex number is not a number (NaN), whereas `this['isInfinite']` would check if it is infinite.

DONE.
