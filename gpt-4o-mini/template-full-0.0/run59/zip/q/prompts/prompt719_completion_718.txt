Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from an empty array to an array containing a `null` value, which may lead to unexpected results when the method is invoked, as it alters the expected input for the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getKeys", []
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method name from `"keys"` to `"getKeys"`, which likely does not exist in the context of the `dispatch` method, leading to a failure in finding the appropriate handler for the operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the empty array with an array of numbers, which may not be valid arguments for the `dispatch` method, potentially causing it to behave incorrectly or throw an error.

DONE.
