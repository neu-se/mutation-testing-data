  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.u
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.u` is the UTC offset, whereas `tz.d` is the DST offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.c
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.c` is the country code, whereas `tz.d` is the DST offset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz[d]
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz[d]` is the DST offset, but `tz.d` is the UTC offset.

DONE.
