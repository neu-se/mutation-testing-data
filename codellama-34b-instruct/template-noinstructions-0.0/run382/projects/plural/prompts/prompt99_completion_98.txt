  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of "a" in the input string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag would cause the regular expression to ignore case when matching "a" in the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag would cause the regular expression to match "a" only at the beginning of a line in the input string.

DONE.
