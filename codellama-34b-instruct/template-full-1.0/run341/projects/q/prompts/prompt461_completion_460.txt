  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" && typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns "object" when the operand is a function, but `process.emit` is a function, so this code would not behave the same way as the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "undefined" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns "undefined" when the operand is undefined, but `process.emit` is a function, so this code would not behave the same way as the original.
