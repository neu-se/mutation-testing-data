  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
a['pi']
```
This would result in different behavior because `pi` is a different constant than `phi`, and would calculate a different angle.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
a['phi'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the angle by 2 would cause the calculation to differ.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```scss
Math.cos(a['phi'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos()` function is different from multiplying a number.

DONE.
