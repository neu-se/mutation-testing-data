 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition for pushing `line` into `desiredLines` would be easier to satisfy, potentially including lines that should not be part of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value ? value : 42
```
This would result in different behavior because if `value` is falsy (except for `null` or `undefined`), it will push the number `42` into `desiredLines`, instead of the original line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value && 'some string'
```
This would result in different behavior because if `value` is truthy, it will push the string `'some string'` into `desiredLines`, instead of the original line.

DONE.
