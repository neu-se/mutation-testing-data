  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a different function than `onProgress`, and would not trigger the `notify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a different function than `onProgress`, and would not trigger the `notify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAny
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAny` is a different function than `onProgress`, and would not trigger the `notify` function.

DONE.
