  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` value would be shifted by 360 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` value would be shifted by -360 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` value would be doubled, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
