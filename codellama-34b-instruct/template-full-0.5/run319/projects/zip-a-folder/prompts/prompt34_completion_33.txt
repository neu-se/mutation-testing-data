  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which could cause the program to continue running even if there was an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', reject(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error message, which could cause the program to crash or behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with a null value, which could cause the program to continue running without handling the error.

DONE.
