  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `err` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable is not being checked for nullity, and the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable is being checked for nullity, and the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `err`.

DONE.
