  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array, whereas `slice` creates a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array with the same number of elements as the original array, whereas `slice` creates a new array with a subset of the original array's elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` creates a new array with only the elements that match the filter function, whereas `slice` creates a new array with a subset of the original array's elements.

DONE.
