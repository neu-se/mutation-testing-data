  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with an incorrect argument, which could cause the function to return an incorrect value or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with an incorrect argument, which could cause the function to return an incorrect value or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would be called with an incorrect argument, which could cause the function to return an incorrect value or throw an error.

DONE.
