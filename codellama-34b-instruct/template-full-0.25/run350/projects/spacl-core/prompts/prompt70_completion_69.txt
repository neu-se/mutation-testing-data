  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the replacement code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the entire path, while the replacement code fragment only checks the first segment of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the entire path, while the replacement code fragment only checks the alphanumeric characters in the path.

DONE.
