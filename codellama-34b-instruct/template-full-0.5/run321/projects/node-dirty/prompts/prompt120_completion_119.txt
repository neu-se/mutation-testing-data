  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is greater than 0. This means that the original code would consider the write stream to be drained if there are no in-flight writes, while the new code would consider it to be drained if there are any in-flight writes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if the size of the queue is greater than 0. This means that the original code would consider the write stream to be drained if there are no in-flight writes, while the new code would consider it to be drained if there are any items in the queue.
