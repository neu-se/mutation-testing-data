  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception.value` is an object. This would cause the `when` function to receive a string instead of an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string that represents the stack trace of the exception, while `exception.value` is an object. This would cause the `when` function to receive a string instead of an object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, while `exception.value` is a truthy object. This would cause the `when` function to receive a falsy value instead of a truthy object, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
