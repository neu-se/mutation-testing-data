  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with the same argument, but the `sinh` function would be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function would be called with the same argument, but the `cosh` function would be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different output.

DONE.
