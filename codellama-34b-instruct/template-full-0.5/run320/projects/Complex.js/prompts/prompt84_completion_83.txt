  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `parser_exit()`, which would exit the parser and return an error, but the new code would return a complex number with a value of infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `parser_exit()`, which would exit the parser and return an error, but the new code would return a complex number with a value of Not a Number (NaN).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was `parser_exit()`, which would exit the parser and return an error, but the new code would return a complex number with a value of 0.

DONE.
