Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
srcFile
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the source file exists instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file overwriting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/non/existent/path'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always throw an error or not throw an error, depending on the value of `clobber`, since the file '/non/existent/path' does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
destFile + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check for the existence of a temporary file instead of the actual destination file, potentially allowing overwriting of the destination file even if `clobber` is set to `false`.

DONE.
