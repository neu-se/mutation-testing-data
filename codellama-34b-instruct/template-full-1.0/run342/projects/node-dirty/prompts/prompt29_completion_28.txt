  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with the key, instead of the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random value from the `_data` map, instead of the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(key + '!');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value associated with a key that is different from the original key, which would cause the `get()` function to return undefined.

DONE.
