  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.pop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method expects an index as its argument, not a value to be removed. In this case, `0` would be interpreted as an index, and the first element of the array would be removed, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop` removes the last element. In this case, the first element of the `laterQueue` array would be removed, potentially causing the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method removes a specified number of elements from an array, starting at a specified index. In this case, the first element of the `later
