  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the origin point (0, 0) regardless of the input distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(this.latitude + distance, this.longitude + bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the distance and bearing to the current latitude and longitude, rather than using them to calculate a new point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new GeoPoint(this.latitude * distance, this.longitude * bearing);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the current latitude and longitude by the distance and bearing, rather than using them to calculate a new point.

DONE.
