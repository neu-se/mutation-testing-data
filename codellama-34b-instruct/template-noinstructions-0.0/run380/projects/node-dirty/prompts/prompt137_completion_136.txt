  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value in the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the data object. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set the value of `row.val` to the value of `row.key`, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes a key-value pair from the data object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the data object. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the code to delete the key-value pair corresponding to `row.key` from the data object, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different
