  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the archive from the second character of the source path, rather than the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the source path, which would change the directory structure of the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split('/').reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the directory structure of the source path, which would change the archive's directory structure.

DONE.
