Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` calculates the exponential of a number, which will yield a different scaling factor compared to `Math.pow(10, places || 0)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(10)` returns the square root of 10, which is a constant value (~3.16) rather than a power of 10, leading to incorrect scaling of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because simply adding 1 to `places` changes the intended scaling factor, which would not correctly represent the number of decimal places to round to, thus affecting the output of the `floor` function.

DONE.
