  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is initially set to `false`, but is later reassigned to `true` when the `once` function is called. In the original code, the `end` variable is passed as an argument to the `cb` function, which is not the case when `a` is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `end`, and would not trigger the same behavior when passed to the `cb` function as the `end` variable would.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `end`, and would not trigger the same behavior when passed to the `cb` function as the `end` variable would.

DONE.
