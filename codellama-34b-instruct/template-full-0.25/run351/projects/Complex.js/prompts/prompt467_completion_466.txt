  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `a` and `b` are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `a` and `b` are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `a` and `b` are not equal.

DONE.
