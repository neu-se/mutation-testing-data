  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called, and the `newOp` object would not be added to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not be called, and the `newOp` object would not be added to the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newOp` object would be added to the beginning of the `ops` array instead of the end.

DONE.
