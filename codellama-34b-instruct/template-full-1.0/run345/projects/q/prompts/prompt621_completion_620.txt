  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is called instead of the `set` method, which would cause the value of the property to be retrieved instead of set.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called instead of the `set` method, which would cause the property to be deleted instead of set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is called instead of the `set` method, which would cause the property to be set to a default value instead of the specified value.

DONE.
