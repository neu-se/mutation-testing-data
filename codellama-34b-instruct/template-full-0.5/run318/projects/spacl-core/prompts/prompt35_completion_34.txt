  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(2)` method would return a different array of strings than the original `slice(1)` method, which would affect the `part` variable and the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join('')` method would concatenate the array of strings into a single string, which would affect the `part` variable and the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(p => p.toLowerCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map(p => p.toLowerCase())` method would convert all the elements of the array to lowercase, which would affect the `part` variable
