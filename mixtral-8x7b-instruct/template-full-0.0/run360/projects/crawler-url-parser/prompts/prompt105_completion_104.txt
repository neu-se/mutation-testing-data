 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` variable would be an empty string instead of being undefined, which could lead to different code execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` variable would be null instead of being undefined, which could lead to different code execution paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the raw text content of the element instead of trimming it, potentially leading to whitespace differences that could affect the outcome of string comparisons.

DONE.
