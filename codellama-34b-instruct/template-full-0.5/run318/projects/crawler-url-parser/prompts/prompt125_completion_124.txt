  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (linkurl instanceof String)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if `linkurl` is an instance of the `String` class, whereas the original code used the `typeof` operator to check if `linkurl` was a string primitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (linkurl.constructor === String)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property of an object references the function that created the object, and the `String` function is used to create new string objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (linkurl.prototype === String.prototype)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prototype` property of an object references the prototype object associated with the object's constructor, and the `String.prototype` object is used as the prototype for new string objects.

DONE.
