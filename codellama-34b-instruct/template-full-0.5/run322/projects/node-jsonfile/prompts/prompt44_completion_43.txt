  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `options` object, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods. This would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `reviver` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `options` object, while `{}` is an empty object that does not have any properties or methods. This would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `reviver` property of `{}`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment refers to the `options` object, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have any properties or methods. This would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error when it tries
