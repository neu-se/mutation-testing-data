  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be pushing the `nextOp` value onto the `ops` array, which would cause the `slice` method to return a different value than the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be pushing `null` onto the `ops` array, which would cause the `slice` method to return a different value than the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be pushing the `index` value onto the `ops` array, which would cause the `slice` method to return a different value than the original.

DONE.
