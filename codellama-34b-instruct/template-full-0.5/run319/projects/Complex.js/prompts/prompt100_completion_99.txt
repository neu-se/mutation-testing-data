  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '-') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `-` to `+`, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '/') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from `-` to `*` or `/`, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '-') + c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `1` is added to the result, which would cause the resulting value to be different.

DONE.
