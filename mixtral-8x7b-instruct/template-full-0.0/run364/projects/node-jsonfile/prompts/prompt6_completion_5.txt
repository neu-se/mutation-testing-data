 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `fs` module instead of the universalify wrapper, which may not handle different environments (like browser or node) consistently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
universalify.fromPromise(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `fromPromise` method on the `universalify` object with `fs.readFile` instead of the original `universalify.fromCallback(_readFile)`, which may cause issues with handling callbacks in different environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(_fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a direct Promise resolution with `_fs.readFile`, bypassing the `universalify` layer, which may not handle different environments consistently.

By introducing these changes, the test suite should fail, indicating that
