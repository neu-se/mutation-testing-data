  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while the replaced code fragment uses the `a * z['re']` expression, which is not equivalent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while the replaced code fragment uses the `a + z['re']` expression, which is not equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the power of two complex numbers, while the replaced code fragment uses the `a - z['re']` expression, which is not equivalent.

DONE.
