  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function that takes two arguments, but `null` is a null value that does not have any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function that takes two arguments, but `undefined` is a value that does not have any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a function that takes two arguments, but `0` is a number value that does not have any arguments.

DONE.
