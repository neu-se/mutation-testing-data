  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is used to extract the file name and line number from a stack trace, and returning `null` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is used to extract the file name and line number from a stack trace, and returning `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is used to extract the file name and line number from a stack trace, and returning 0 would cause the function to return `undefined` instead, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
