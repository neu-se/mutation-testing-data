  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'cellos'`, which is a plural noun.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'cell'`, which is a singular noun but with a different spelling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'cello'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'cello' + 's'`, which is a plural noun.

DONE.
