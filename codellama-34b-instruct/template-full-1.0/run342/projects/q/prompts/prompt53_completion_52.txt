  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is only used if it is an object, and if it is not an object, the code will not function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString() !== "[object process]"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method on the `process` object returns a string indicating its type, and if the string is not "[object process]" the code will not function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that is only called if it exists, and if it does not exist the code will not function correctly.

DONE.
