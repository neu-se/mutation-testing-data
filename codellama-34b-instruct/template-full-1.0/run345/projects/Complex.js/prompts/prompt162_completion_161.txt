  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function checks for Not-a-Number, whereas `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` function checks for whether the number is zero, whereas `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function checks for whether the number is finite, whereas `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

DONE.
