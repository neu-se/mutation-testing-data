  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `b` is null instead of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is NaN instead of null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined || a === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a` is Infinity instead of null.

DONE.
