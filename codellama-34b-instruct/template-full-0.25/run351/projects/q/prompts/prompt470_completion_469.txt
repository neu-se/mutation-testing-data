  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` handler to the promise that throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` handler to the promise that returns a rejected promise with the message "Something went wrong".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    return Q.fulfill("Something went wrong");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new `then` handler to the promise that returns a fulfilled promise with the message "Something went wrong".

DONE.
