  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country with deprecated timezones instead of the current behavior of returning a country with all timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => getCountry('UK', options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the UK country instead of the current behavior of returning a country based on the input parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c).countries[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first country listed in the timezone object, which may not be the same as the current behavior of returning the country specified in the input parameter.

DONE.
