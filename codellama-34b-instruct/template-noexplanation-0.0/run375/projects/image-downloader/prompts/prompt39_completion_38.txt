  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This change will cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This change will cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which is different from the original behavior where the promise is resolved with the `filename` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve({ filename: 'wrong_file.txt' })
```
This change will cause the promise to be resolved with a different filename than the original behavior, which could cause issues if the code that uses the promise is not expecting a different filename.

DONE.
