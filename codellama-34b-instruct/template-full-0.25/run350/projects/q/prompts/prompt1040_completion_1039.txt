  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not calling the `resolve()` method, but this new code fragment would call it immediately, which could cause the `put()` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not calling the `reject()` method, but this new code fragment would call it immediately, which could cause the `put()` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was not using the `promise` property of the `Q.defer()` object, but this new code fragment would use it, which could cause the `put()` method to behave differently.

DONE.
