Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!localhost)\w+:/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow URLs that start with "localhost" to be treated as valid, potentially allowing local URLs to bypass the intended validation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!.*:\/\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly match any string that does not contain "://", which could lead to valid URLs being rejected erroneously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!\w+:).*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any string that does not start with a protocol (like "http:") to be considered valid, which could lead to invalid URLs being processed further in the code.

DONE.
