  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because `2*b` is twice the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b+1` is one more than `b`.

DONE.
