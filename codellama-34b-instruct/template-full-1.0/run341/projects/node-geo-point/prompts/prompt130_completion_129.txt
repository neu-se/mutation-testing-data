  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `this` refers to the `GeoPoint` instance, but `null` does not have any properties or methods that can be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` does not have any properties or methods that can be called, but `this` in the original code refers to the `GeoPoint` instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  x: 0,
  y: 0
}
```
This would result in different behavior because a new object with `x` and `y` properties that are both `0` is created, but `this` in the original code refers to the `GeoPoint` instance.

DONE.
