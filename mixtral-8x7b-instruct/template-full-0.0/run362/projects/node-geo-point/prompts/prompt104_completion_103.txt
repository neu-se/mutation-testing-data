 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * (Math.pow(2, zoom) - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the wrong formula for calculating the `x` value, which would cause incorrect tile coordinates to be generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.round` function instead of `Math.floor`, which would result in different (and potentially incorrect) tile coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the wrong exponent for the `Math.pow` function, which would cause the `x` value to be multiplied by 4 instead of 2, resulting in incorrect
