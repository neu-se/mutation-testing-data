  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics[^i]$/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would match words that end in "ics", while the provided code fragment would match words that end in "ics" followed by any character other than "i".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would match only once, while the provided code fragment would match multiple times due to the use of the "g" flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/, function(w) { return w.repeat(2) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word unchanged, while the provided code fragment would return the word repeated twice.

DONE.
