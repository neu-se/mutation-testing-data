  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, whereas `Q` would return a promise that resolves to `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, whereas `Q` would return a promise that resolves to `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` would cause the promise to be resolved when all the promises passed as arguments are resolved, whereas `Q` would return a promise that resolves to `Q`.

DONE.
