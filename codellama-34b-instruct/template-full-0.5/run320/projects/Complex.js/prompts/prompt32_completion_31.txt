  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== 0` would always evaluate to `true` when `a` is a non-zero number, whereas `a === 0` would only evaluate to `true` when `a` is exactly equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a > 0` would only evaluate to `true` when `a` is greater than zero, whereas `a === 0` would evaluate to `true` when `a` is exactly equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a < 0` would only evaluate to `true` when `a` is less than zero, whereas `a === 0` would evaluate to `true` when `a` is exactly equal to zero.

DONE.
