  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array with the value `1` as the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the value `2` as the first element, instead of an array with the value `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the value `null` as the first element, instead of an array with the value `1`.

DONE.
