  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended && true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a truthy value to the callback function, whereas the original code passes a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a constant truthy value to the callback function, whereas the original code passes a dynamic value based on the `ended` flag.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a constant falsy value to the callback function, whereas the original code passes a dynamic value based on the `ended` flag.

DONE.
