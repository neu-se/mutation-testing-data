 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called, whereas in the original code, it is called with a `null` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with an empty object, whereas in the original code, it is called with a `null` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with an empty function, whereas in the original code, it is called with a `null` argument.

By introducing these changes, we are altering the behavior of the `set` method, which could potentially expose weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
