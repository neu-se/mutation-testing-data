  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.length` returns the length of the base array, whereas `base.slice` returns a shallow copy of the base array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the base array, whereas `base.slice` returns a shallow copy of the base array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(index, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.slice(index, index + 1)` returns a shallow copy of the base array starting from the index, whereas `base.slice` returns a shallow copy of the base array.

DONE.
