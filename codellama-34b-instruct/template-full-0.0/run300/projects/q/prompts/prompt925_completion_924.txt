  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would therefore cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, and would therefore cause the code to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that is not a function, and would therefore cause the code to execute differently.

DONE.
