  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if there are less plus signs than minus signs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if there are more minus signs than plus signs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if there are more plus signs than minus signs, while this new code fragment checks if there are an equal number of plus and minus signs.

DONE.
