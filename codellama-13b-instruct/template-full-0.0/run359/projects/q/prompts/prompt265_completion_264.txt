  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with a null value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with a string value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a string value.

DONE.
