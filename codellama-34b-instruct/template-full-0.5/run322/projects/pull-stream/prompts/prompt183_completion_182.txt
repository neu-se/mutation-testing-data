  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would continue to execute even after the end of the array has been reached, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would continue to execute even after the end of the array has been reached, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would continue to execute even after the end of the array has been reached, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
