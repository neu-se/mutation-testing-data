 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(answerPs[i]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `Q(answerPs[i])` directly creates a promise from the `answerPs[i]` value. If `answerPs[i]` is not a promise, the behavior would differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(answerPs[i]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` accepts a wider range of input values, converting them into a promise if they aren't already. If `answerPs[i]` is a thenable object (an object with a `then()` method), the behavior would differ.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.delay(answerPs[i]).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay()`
