  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country === null` checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `country !== null` checks if it is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof country === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country` checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while `typeof country === 'undefined'` checks if it is undefined.

DONE.
