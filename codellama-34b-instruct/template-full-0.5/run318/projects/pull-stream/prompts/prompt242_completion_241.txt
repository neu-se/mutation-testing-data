  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if it expects a non-null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if it expects a defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"foo"` would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if it expects a different type of value.

DONE.
