  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function, which has a different range and behavior than `cosh`, which is the hyperbolic cosine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would reverse the sign of the result of the `cosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the result of the `cosh` function, changing its range and behavior.

DONE.
