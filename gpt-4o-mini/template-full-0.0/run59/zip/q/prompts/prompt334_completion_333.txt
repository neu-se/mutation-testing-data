Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspect.state === "rejected") {
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the state of the promise without calling the `inspect` function, leading to a potential runtime error or incorrect handling of the promise state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspect() === "rejected") {
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the result of the `inspect` function (which is an object) directly to the string "rejected", causing the condition to always evaluate to false, and thus never setting the `promise.exception`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (inspect().state === "fulfilled") {
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the "fulfilled" state instead of "rejected", which would prevent the promise from correctly storing the rejection reason when the promise is actually rejected.

DONE.
