  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[0](err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first callback in the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment calls all callbacks in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[cbs.length - 1](err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the last callback in the `cbs` array, whereas the original code fragment calls all callbacks in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[Math.floor(Math.random() * cbs.length)](err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a callback to call, whereas the original code fragment calls all callbacks in the array.

DONE.
