  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.call(this, op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the `this` context set to the current `Delta` object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the `this` context set to the global object, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate.apply(this, [op, index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the `this` context set to the current `Delta` object, and pass the `op` and `index` arguments as an array, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
