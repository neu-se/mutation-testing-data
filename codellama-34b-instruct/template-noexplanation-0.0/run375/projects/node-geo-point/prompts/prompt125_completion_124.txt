  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2));
```
This code calculates the distance between two points on a sphere (such as the Earth) using the Haversine formula. It takes into account the curvature of the sphere and returns the shortest distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude - point.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude - point.longitude, 2)) * 1000;
```
This code calculates the distance between two points on a sphere (such as the Earth) using the Haversine formula, but it multiplies the result by 1000 to convert the distance from meters to kilometers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.sqrt(
