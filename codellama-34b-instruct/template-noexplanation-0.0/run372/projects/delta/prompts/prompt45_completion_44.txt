  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This change will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error if `b` is not an object or null, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object' && b !== null
```
This change will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error if `b` is not an object or null, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null && typeof b === 'object'
```
This change will cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error if `b` is not an object or null, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
