 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with a specific timezone name, which may not match the expected input for the `getCountryForTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder with an integer, which is not a valid input for the `getCountryForTimezone` function, causing it to return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'non-existent-tz'
