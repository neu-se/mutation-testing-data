  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1, w.length - 1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different output for words that end in 'quy'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(' random string' + w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different output for words that end in 'quy', and also change the output for other words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(_split(w).reverse().join() + 'y')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would produce a different output for words that end in 'quy', and also change the output for other words.

DONE.
