 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http://' + URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always prepends 'http://' to the result of URL.resolve(), which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl).replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the protocol (http:// or https://) from the resulting URL, which could cause issues with relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object using the URL constructor, which may behave differently than URL.parse() and URL.resolve().

DONE.
