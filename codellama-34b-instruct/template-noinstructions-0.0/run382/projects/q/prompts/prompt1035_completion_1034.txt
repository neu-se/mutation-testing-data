  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q.nbind` with the arguments `args`, which is not the same as the original code that called `Q.nbind` with the arguments `this` and `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(this, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q.nbind` with the arguments `this` and `args`, which is not the same as the original code that called `Q.nbind` with the arguments `void 0` and `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(this, [args]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `Q.nbind` with the arguments `this` and `[args]`, which is not the same as the original code that called `
