  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring()` would remove the first character of the URL, potentially causing it to be invalid or unexpected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.split('.')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` would split the URL into an array of substrings using `.` as the delimiter, and then return the second element of the array, which could be the TLD or extension of the URL, rather than the first character as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid URL, and would cause the function to throw an error when attempting to use it as such.

DONE.
