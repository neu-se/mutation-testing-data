  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called twice, which would cause the `otherIter` iterator to advance by two elements instead of one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.peek()` method to be called instead of the `otherIter.next()` method, which would return the next element in the iterator without advancing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter.prev()` method to be called instead of the `otherIter.next()` method, which would return the previous element in the iterator instead of the next one.

DONE.
