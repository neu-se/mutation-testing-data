  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined` in JavaScript. In this case, `null` would be stored in the database as the value for the key, whereas `undefined` would be used to indicate that the key should be deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 0, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, whereas `undefined` is not. In this case, the value `0` would be stored in the database for the key, whereas `undefined` would be used to indicate that the key should be deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, 'null', cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `'null'` is a string, whereas `null` is an object. In this case, the string `'null'` would be stored in the database for the key, whereas `null` would be used to
