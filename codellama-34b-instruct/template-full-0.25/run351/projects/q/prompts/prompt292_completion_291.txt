  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("progress")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include any arguments, while this replacement code fragment includes the string "progress" as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include any arguments, while this replacement code fragment includes the variable "progress" as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include any arguments, while this replacement code fragment includes the number 10 as an argument.

DONE.
