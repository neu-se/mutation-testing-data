  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive `a` as the first argument, which is the real part of the complex number, instead of `b`, which is the imaginary part. This would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive `a + b` as the first argument, which is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. This would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function would receive `a * b` as the first argument, which is the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. This would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
