  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, which could cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would not add the new operation to the `ops` array, which could cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add a new operation with a null `insert` property to the `ops` array, which could cause the `length` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
