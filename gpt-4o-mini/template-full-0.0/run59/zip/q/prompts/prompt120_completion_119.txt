Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, rather than checking if an object has a specific property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this anonymous function will always return `false`, meaning that the check for the object's own property will always fail, regardless of whether the property exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.valueOf` returns the primitive value of the specified object, which does not perform a property existence check like `hasOwnProperty` does.

DONE.
