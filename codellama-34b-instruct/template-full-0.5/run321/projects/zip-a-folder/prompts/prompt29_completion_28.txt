  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called when the archive is finalized, which means that the promise is resolved and the `then` method is called. Replacing `resolve` with `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected and the `catch` method to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a value of `true`, which means that the promise is resolved with a value of `true`. This would cause the `then` method to be called with a value of `true`, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called with a value of `false`, which means that the promise is resolved with a value of `false`. This would cause the `then` method
