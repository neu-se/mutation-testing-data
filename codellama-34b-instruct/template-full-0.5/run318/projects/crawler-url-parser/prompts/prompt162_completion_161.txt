  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "sublevel" for links that have one more path part than the current page, rather than just one more.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "sublevel" for links that have one more path part than the current page, or the same number of path parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "uplevel" for links that have fewer path parts than the current page, rather than just one fewer.

DONE.
