  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` is a method that sets a value in the `Map` object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the `Map` object. Using `set` instead of `get` would cause the code to set a new value in the `Map` object, rather than retrieving the existing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from the `Map` object, whereas `get` is a method that retrieves a value from the `Map` object. Using `delete` instead of `get` would cause the code to remove the key-value pair from the `Map` object, rather than retrieving the existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear`
