  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would change the value of `data`, potentially causing the test to fail if it relies on the specific value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `data` array, potentially causing the test to fail if it relies on the specific value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `data` array, potentially causing the test to fail if it relies on the specific value of `data`.

DONE.
