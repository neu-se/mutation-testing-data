  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is being called with a different argument, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is being called with a different argument, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(b) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function is being called with a different argument, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
