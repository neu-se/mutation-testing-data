  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `data` instead of `null`, which may cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `null` instead of `data`, which may cause issues in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `data`, which may cause issues in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
