  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base delta starting from the next index instead of the current index, which would cause the slice to include the wrong portion of the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base delta up to one index before the end of the slice, which would cause the slice to exclude the last operation in the base delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the base delta up to one index after the end of the slice, which would cause the slice to include an extra operation in the base delta.

DONE.
