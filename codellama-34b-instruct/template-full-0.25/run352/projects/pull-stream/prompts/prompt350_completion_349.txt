  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test` is a function, but `prop` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test()` is a function call, but `prop` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.test.bind(prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.test.bind(prop)` is a bound function, but `prop` is an object.

DONE.
