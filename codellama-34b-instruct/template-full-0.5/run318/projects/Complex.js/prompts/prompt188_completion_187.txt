  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be applied to `a` and `z['re']`, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would be applied to `a` and `z['re']`, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would be applied to `a` and `z['re']`, which would produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
