  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData instanceof Object &&
            otherData instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for null values, while this code does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisData.constructor === Object &&
            otherData.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for null values, while this code does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(thisData) === Object.prototype &&
            Object.getPrototypeOf(otherData) === Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for null values, while this code does not.

DONE.
