  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` and the `else` block would never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `end === false` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` and the `else` block would always be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end !== true` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` and the `else` block would never be executed.

DONE.
