  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This change will cause the code to access the next element in the array instead of the current one, which may cause the code to behave differently and potentially reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This change will cause the code to access the previous element in the array instead of the current one, which may also cause the code to behave differently and potentially reveal bugs in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] + 1
```
This change will cause the code to access the current element in the array and add 1 to it, which may cause the code to behave differently and potentially reveal bugs in the test suite.

DONE.
