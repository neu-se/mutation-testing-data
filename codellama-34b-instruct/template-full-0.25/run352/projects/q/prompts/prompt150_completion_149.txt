  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `stack` array, which is used to concatenate the stack traces of the promise and the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `stack` array, which is used to concatenate the stack traces of the promise and the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0, -2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two elements of the `stack` array, which are used to concatenate the stack traces of the promise and the error.

DONE.
