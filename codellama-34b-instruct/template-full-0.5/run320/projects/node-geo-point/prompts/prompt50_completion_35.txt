  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(Δλ)` converts the longitude difference from degrees to radians, but `rad2deg(Δλ)` converts it back to degrees, which would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI + Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(Δλ)` converts the longitude difference from degrees to radians, but `Math.PI + Δλ` adds a constant value to the longitude difference, which would result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI - Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad(Δλ)` converts the longitude difference from degrees to radians, but `Math.PI - Δλ` subtracts a constant value from the longitude difference, which would
