  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `path` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `path` string into an array of substrings, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `path` string starting from the second character, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
