  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, even if `define` is a function and `define['amd']` is truthy. This would cause the code to enter the `else` block, which would define the `Complex` constructor and export it as a module.

DONE.
