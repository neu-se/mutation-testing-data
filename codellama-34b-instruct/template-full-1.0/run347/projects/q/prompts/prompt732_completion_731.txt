  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 || promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also resolve the promise if the array of promises is empty, which was not the intention of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve the promise if the array of promises is not empty, which could lead to a deadlock if one of the promises never settles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 0 && promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only resolve the promise if the array of promises is empty, which was not the intention of the original code.

DONE.
