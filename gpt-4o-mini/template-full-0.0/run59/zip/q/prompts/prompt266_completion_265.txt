Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `reject` function to proceed even if `resolvedPromise` is set to `null`, which would incorrectly allow rejection of a promise that has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check if `resolvedPromise` is falsy, which would allow the `reject` function to execute even if `resolvedPromise` is an empty object or any other falsy value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `true`, which would never be the case, thus allowing the `reject` function to always execute, regardless of the actual state of the promise.

DONE.
