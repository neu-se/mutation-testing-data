  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to compute the cosine of the angle between the two points, while the replaced code fragment uses the `sin` function to compute the sine of the angle between the two points. This would cause the `calculateBearing` method to return a different value, which would be a bug.

DONE.
