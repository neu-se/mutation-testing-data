  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `-b`, which is the negative of the imaginary part. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different imaginary part, and potentially a different magnitude.

DONE.
