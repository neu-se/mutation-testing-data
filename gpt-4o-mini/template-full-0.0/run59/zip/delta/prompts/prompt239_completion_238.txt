Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete zero length, effectively skipping the delete operation entirely, which could lead to incorrect state in the `retDelta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more operation than available, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect deletion of operations in `retDelta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more operation than intended, which could lead to unintended modifications in the `retDelta`, possibly resulting in data loss or corruption.

DONE.
