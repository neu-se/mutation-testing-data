Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on `null`, leading to a runtime error instead of invoking the method on the intended object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also lead to a runtime error when trying to call the `dispatch` method on `undefined`, whereas the original code correctly calls it on the provided object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string to the `dispatch` method instead of the expected object, which would likely cause the method to fail or behave incorrectly, as it would not be able to find the specified method on a string.

DONE.
