  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[Symbol.iterator]();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Symbol.iterator` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray;
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` would be negated, returning `false` for arrays and `true` for non-arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` expects an array as its argument, but `1` is not an array and would return `false`.

DONE.
