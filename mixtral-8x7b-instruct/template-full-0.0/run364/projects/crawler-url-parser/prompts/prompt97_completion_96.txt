 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl !== null && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses strict inequality instead of the loose inequality, which would change how `currentUrl` with falsy values like `0`, `''`, or `false` is handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && currentUrl['url']
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses bracket notation instead of dot notation, which would change how property access works, especially if `currentUrl` has a property with a name that is a reserved word or contains special characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && currentUrl.hasOwnProperty('url')
