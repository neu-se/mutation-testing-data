  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` negates the entire regular expression, causing the test to pass even if the input string does not match the original pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\/\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\w+` pattern was changed to `\/\w+`, causing the test to pass for any input string that starts with `http`, even if it does not contain a valid domain name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\*+\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` pattern was changed to `*+`, causing the test to pass for any input string that contains one or more asterisks, even if it does not match the original pattern.

DONE.
