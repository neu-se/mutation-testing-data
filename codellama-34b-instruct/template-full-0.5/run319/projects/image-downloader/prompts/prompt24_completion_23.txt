  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + 'file.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest` property is being modified to include a hardcoded file name, which may not be present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname()` function returns the directory name of the file, whereas the original code fragment returns the full file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.basename()` function returns the file name without the directory path, whereas the original code fragment returns the full file path.

DONE.
