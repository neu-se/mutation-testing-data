  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `i` is greater than `max`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end > max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `end` is greater than `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy, while this code fragment checks if `end + max` is truthy.

DONE.
