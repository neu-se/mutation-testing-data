  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length < 1 || !string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a string that is not empty and ends with a slash, while the mutated code fragment checks for a string that is empty or does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.length > 1 && string.startsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a string that is not empty and ends with a slash, while the mutated code fragment checks for a string that is not empty and starts with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!string.contains('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for a string that contains a slash, while the mutated code fragment checks for a string that does not contain a slash.

DONE.
