  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would no longer match the string "/index.html" and would therefore not replace it with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index.html'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the string "/index.html" and would therefore replace it with the string "index.html".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'index.htm'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would now match the string "/index.htm" and would therefore replace it with the string "index.htm".

DONE.
