  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would not be called with a fulfilled value, but rather with `undefined`. This could cause issues if the `then` method relies on the fulfilled value being passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `null` as the fulfilled value, which could cause issues if the `then` method relies on the fulfilled value being passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the string `"test"` as the fulfilled value, which could cause issues if the `then` method relies on the fulfilled value being passed to it.

DONE.
