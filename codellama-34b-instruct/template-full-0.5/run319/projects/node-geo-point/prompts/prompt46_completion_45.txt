  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would return a value that is off by 1 degree, which would affect the calculation of the bearing and destination points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would return a value that is twice as large as the original value, which would affect the calculation of the bearing and destination points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function would return a value that is off by 1 degree, which would affect the calculation of the bearing and destination points.

DONE.
