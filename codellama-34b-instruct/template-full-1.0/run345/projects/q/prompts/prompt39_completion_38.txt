  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
throw e;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches the error and re-throws it synchronously, while this code fragment throws the error asynchronously.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
console.log(e);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches and re-throws the error, while this code fragment logs the error to the console.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(() => { throw e; }, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment catches and re-throws the error, while this code fragment catches the error and re-throws it asynchronously after a delay of 1 second.

DONE.
