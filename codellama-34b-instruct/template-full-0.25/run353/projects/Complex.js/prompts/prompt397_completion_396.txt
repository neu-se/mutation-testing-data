  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acos']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `asin` have different ranges and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['atan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan` and `asin` have different ranges and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['acot']
```
This would result in different behavior because `acot` and `asin` have different ranges and values.

DONE.
