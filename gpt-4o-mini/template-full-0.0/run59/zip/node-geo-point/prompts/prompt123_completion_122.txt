Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the bearing to the origin point (0, 0) instead of the intended destination point, leading to incorrect bearing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the current point instead of the latitude of the destination point, which would not provide a valid bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the latitude of the destination point and only use its longitude, which would lead to an incorrect bearing calculation as it does not consider the full geographical position of the destination.

DONE.
