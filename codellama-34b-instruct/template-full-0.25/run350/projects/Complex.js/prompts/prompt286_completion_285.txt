  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the `cosh` function to operate on the real part instead of the imaginary part, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `b * 2` is twice the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `b * 2` instead of `b` would cause the `cosh` function to operate on twice the imaginary part instead of the imaginary part, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `b` is
