  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be bound to the `this` context of the `Promise` object, which would allow it to access the `Promise` object's properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be bound to the `promise` object, which would allow it to access the `promise` object's properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be bound to the `Q` object, which would allow it to access the `Q` object's properties and methods.

DONE.
