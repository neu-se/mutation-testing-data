  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would start at the first index instead of the last index, which could cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would start at the last index instead of the first index, which could cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would start at a random index instead of the first or last index, which could cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

DONE.
