  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable in the code, and replacing it with `b` would cause the code to use the wrong variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a constant value, and replacing `b` with it would cause the code to operate on a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b = b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b = b * b` is a different operation than `b`, and would cause the code to perform a different calculation.

DONE.
