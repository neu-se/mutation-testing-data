  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value && value.then;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is truthy and if it has a `then` property, which would make the function return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value instanceof Promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` is an instance of `Promise`, which would make the function return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value.constructor === Promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `value` has a constructor property that is equal to `Promise`, which would make the function return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
