  *Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abort || abortCb
```
This would result in the `abortCb` function being called every time `abort` is truthy, even if it's not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abort && abortCb
```
This would result in the `abortCb` function being called only when `abort` is truthy, and `abortCb` is also truthy. If `abortCb` is falsy, the function would return `true` instead of calling `abortCb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abort || (abortCb && abortCb())
```
This would result in the `abortCb` function being called only when `abort` is truthy, but also allow `abortCb` to be falsy and still return `true`. If `abort` is falsy, the function
