  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...obj}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would spread the object into a new object, potentially changing the object's shape and causing any references to the original object to break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an empty object, causing any references to the original object to return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the object, which could cause issues with functions that expect a JSON object.

DONE.
