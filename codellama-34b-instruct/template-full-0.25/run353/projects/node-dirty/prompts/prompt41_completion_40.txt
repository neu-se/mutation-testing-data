  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented, which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be concatenated with the string '1', which could cause the code to access a different key in the map.

DONE.
