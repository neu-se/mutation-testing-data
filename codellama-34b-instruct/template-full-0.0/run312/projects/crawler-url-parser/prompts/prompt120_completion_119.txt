  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base URL of the current URL, which is not the same as the base URL passed as an argument to the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current URL of the base URL, which is not the same as the current URL passed as an argument to the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the base URL of the base URL, which is not the same as the base URL passed as an argument to the `gettype` function.

DONE.
