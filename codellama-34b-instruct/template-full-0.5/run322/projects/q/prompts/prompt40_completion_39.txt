  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is used to schedule a function to be called repeatedly, whereas `setTimeout` is used to schedule a function to be called once after a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is used to schedule a function to be called once after a specified delay, whereas `setInterval` is used to schedule a function to be called repeatedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is used to schedule a function to be called immediately, whereas `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are used to schedule a function to be called after a specified delay.

DONE.
