  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisp` as the `this` argument in the `apply` method, but replacing it with `null` would cause the method to be called with the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode) as the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisp` as the `this` argument in the `apply` method, but replacing it with `Math.PI` would cause the method to be called with the `Math` object as the `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { return this; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `thisp` as the `this` argument in the `apply` method, but replacing it with a function that returns the current `this` value would cause the method to be called with
