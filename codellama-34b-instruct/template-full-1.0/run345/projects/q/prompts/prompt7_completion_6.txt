  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return `0`, which is not the intended behavior of the `Q` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return `"hello"`, which is not the intended behavior of the `Q` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the function always return `NaN`, which is not the intended behavior of the `Q` function.

DONE.
