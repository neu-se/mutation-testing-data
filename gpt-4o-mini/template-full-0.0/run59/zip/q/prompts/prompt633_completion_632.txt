Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the operation "remove" is not a valid operation for promises in this context, which would likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior instead of deleting the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of deleting the property, it attempts to set the property to `undefined`, which would not remove it but rather leave it as an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete", [key, true]
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `true` is not expected in the context of a delete operation, which could lead to incorrect handling or an error in the promise dispatch mechanism.

DONE.
