  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator is used instead of `>=`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a smaller set of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator is used instead of `>=`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a larger set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of `>=`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` only when `length` is equal to `opLength - offset`.

DONE.
