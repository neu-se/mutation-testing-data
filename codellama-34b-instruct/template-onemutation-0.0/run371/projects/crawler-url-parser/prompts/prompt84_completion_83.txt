  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `trim()` method to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the text, while the new code fragment uses the `split()` method to split the text into an array of words, and then the `join()` method to join the words back together without any spaces. This would result in a different output for the `text` property of the `currentUrl` object.

DONE.
