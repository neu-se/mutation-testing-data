  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs[0]` is a different function than `cb`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => cb` is a different function than `cb`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(() => cb)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => cb() is a different function than `cb`.

DONE.
