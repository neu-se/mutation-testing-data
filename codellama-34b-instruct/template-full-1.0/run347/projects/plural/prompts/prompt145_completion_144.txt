  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the toString method on the rule object, while this replacement code fragment calls the toString method on the rule[1] object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the toString method on the rule object, while this replacement code fragment calls the toString method on the word variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the toString method on the rule object, while this replacement code fragment calls the trim method on the word variable.

DONE.
