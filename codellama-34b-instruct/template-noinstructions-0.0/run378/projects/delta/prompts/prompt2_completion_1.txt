  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would return `true` if `b` is `null`, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === undefined` would return `true` if `b` is `undefined`, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null || b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null || b === undefined` would return `true` if `b` is either `null` or `undefined`, while `typeof b !== 'object'` would return `false` in both cases.

DONE.
