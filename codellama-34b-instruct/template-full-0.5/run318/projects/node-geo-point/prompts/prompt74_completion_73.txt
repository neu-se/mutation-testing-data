  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ = atan2(y, x) + Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, so adding π to the result would cause the angle to be outside of this range, leading to different calculations for the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ = atan2(y, x) - Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to π/2, so subtracting π from the result would cause the angle to be negative, leading to different calculations for the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ = atan2(y, x) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function returns the angle in the range of -π/2 to
