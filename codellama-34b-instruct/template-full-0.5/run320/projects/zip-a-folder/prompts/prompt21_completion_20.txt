  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable, which is a string representing the path to the target file, while the mutated code uses the string literal "foo", which is a different path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable, which is a string representing the path to the target file, while the mutated code uses the `null` value, which is not a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `targetFilePath` variable, which is a string representing the path to the target file, while the mutated code uses the `undefined` value, which is not a valid path.

DONE.
