  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.protocol` is a different value than `pageurl`, which is the original value that is being used in the `gettype` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.host` is a different value than `pageurl`, which is the original value that is being used in the `gettype` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pageurl.pathname` is a different value than `pageurl`, which is the original value that is being used in the `gettype` function.

DONE.
