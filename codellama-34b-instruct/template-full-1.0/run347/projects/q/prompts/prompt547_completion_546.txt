  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a keyword in JavaScript that raises an exception when used as a statement, whereas `reject` is a function that creates a new promise object that is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, whereas `reject` is a function that creates a new promise object that is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` is a function that creates a new promise object that is rejected, whereas `reject` is a keyword that raises an exception when used as a statement.

DONE.
