  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const result = thisOp.insert - otherOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert` are strings, and subtracting strings results in a concatenation of the two strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const result = thisOp.insert.split('').reverse().join('') - otherOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is not equivalent to `-(a + b)`. The reversal of the string would change the endianness of the internal representation of the number, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const result = thisOp.insert.length - otherOp.insert.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.insert` and `otherOp.insert` are strings, and subtracting the lengths of the two strings would not produce the correct result.

DONE.
