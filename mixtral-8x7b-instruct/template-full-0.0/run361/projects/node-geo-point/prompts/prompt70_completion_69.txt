 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
180/Math.PI*θ
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly multiplies θ with a constant value instead of using the `rad2deg` function, which could lead to incorrect degree conversions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan2(y, x) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of operations for calculating the new longitude, which could lead to incorrect longitude values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(y / x) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `atan` function instead of `atan2`, which could lead to incorrect angle calculations when x is negative or zero.

DONE.
