Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.forEach(c => getCountry(c, options));
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, so the result of the function would be `undefined` instead of an array of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(c => getCountry(c, {}));
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty object `{}` is passed as options instead of the original `options`, potentially altering the behavior of `getCountry` if it relies on the options provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(c => getCountry(c, options));
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns an array of elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, which would not return the countries but rather an array of truthy values based on the `getCountry` function's return value.

DONE.
