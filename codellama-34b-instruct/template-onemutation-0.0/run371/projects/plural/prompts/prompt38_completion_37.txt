  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|indices/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches "index" with a case-insensitive flag, while the new code fragment matches "indices" with a case-insensitive flag, which would result in a different output for words that end with "indices".

DONE.
