  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, and replacing it with `null` would cause the function to not be called at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, and replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to not be called at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, and replacing it with `throw new Error()` would cause the function to not be called at all, and would instead throw an error.

DONE.
