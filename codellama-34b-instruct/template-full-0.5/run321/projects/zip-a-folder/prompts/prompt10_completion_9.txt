  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `glob` method to be called when it should not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `glob` method to be called with a different number of arguments, which could cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `glob` method to be called with a different `this` value, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
