 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it is not `undefined`. This could cause issues if `op.delete` is defined but not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while this code checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.delete` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
op.hasOwnProperty('delete')
