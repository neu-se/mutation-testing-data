  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.slice(-1)` extracts the last element of the array and returns it, while `arr.pop` extracts and removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice(-1)` extracts and removes the last element from the array, while `arr.pop` extracts and removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.shift()` extracts and removes the first element from the array, while `arr.pop` extracts and removes the last element.

DONE.
