 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Replaced StopIteration');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error instead of returning the generator's value when using SpiderMonkey generators.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q.reject('Replaced StopIteration');
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a rejected promise instead of returning the generator's value when using SpiderMonkey generators.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an empty object instead of the generator's value, which could cause further issues in the application's logic.

DONE.
