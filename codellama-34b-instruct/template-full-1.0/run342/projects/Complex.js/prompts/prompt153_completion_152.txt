  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z['re'] < 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality to zero, but this code checks for less than zero, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z['im'] > 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality to zero, but this code checks for greater than zero, which could cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] < 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality to zero, but this code checks for greater than zero and less than zero, which could cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
