  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[1]`, which is not the same as `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[1]`, which is not the same as `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]`, which is not the same as `ref[0]`.

DONE.
