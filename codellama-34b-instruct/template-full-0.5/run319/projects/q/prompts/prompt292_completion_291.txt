  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method expects a progress value as an argument, but by passing `null`, it would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method expects a progress value as an argument, but by passing `undefined`, it would cause the method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` method expects a progress value as an argument, but by passing an empty string, it would cause the method to throw an error.

DONE.
