  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, even if `Q.longStackSupport` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `false`, even if `Q.longStackSupport` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport ^ hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator would cause the expression to always evaluate to `true`, even if `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks` have the same value.

DONE.
