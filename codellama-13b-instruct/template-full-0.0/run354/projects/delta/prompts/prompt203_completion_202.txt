  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method is used instead of the `push` method, which would cause the `ops` array to be concatenated instead of pushed onto the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is used instead of the `push` method, which would cause the first element of the `ops` array to be pushed onto the end instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method is used instead of the `push` method, which would cause the first element of the `ops` array to be removed and pushed onto the end instead of the entire array.

DONE.
