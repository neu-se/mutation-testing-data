  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will always reject the promise, regardless of whether the value of `rejected` is truthy or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is always falsy, meaning that the Promise's resolution will always be rejected with the value of `reason`, regardless of whether the value of `rejected` is truthy or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolved(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolved` will always return a resolved promise, regardless of whether the value of `rejected` is truthy or not.

DONE.
