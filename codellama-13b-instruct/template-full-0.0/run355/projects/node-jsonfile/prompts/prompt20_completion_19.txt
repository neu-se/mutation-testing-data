  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is now being passed as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync()`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is now being passed as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync()`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is now being passed as the second argument to `fs.readFileSync()`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
