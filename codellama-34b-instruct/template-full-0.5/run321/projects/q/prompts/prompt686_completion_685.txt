  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to apply the `array_slice` method to the `arguments` object starting from the 0th index, which would result in an empty array being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to apply the `array_slice` method to the `arguments` object starting from the 2nd index, which would result in an array containing only the 2nd and subsequent arguments being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to apply the `array_slice` method to the `arguments` object starting from the last index, which would result in an array containing only the last argument being returned.

DONE.
