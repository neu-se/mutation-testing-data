  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a and b are equal, but this new code checks if a is less than b.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a and b are equal, but this new code checks if a and b are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if a and b are equal, but this new code checks if a + b is equal to 0.

DONE.
