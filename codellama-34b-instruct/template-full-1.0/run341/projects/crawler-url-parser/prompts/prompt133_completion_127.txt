  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" character to split the path and force the URL to be absolute, while the new code would use the "\" character, which is not a valid URL separator and would cause the URL to be treated as relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "#" character as a delimiter for the query string, while the new code would use it as a URL separator, which would cause the query string to be interpreted as a path instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" ?"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "?" character as a delimiter for the query string, while the new code would use it as a URL separator, which would cause the query string to be interpreted as a path instead.

DONE.
