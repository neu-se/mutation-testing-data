 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.emit('load', this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which could affect closures and variable bindings within the `_load` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit.bind(this, 'load', this._data.size)
