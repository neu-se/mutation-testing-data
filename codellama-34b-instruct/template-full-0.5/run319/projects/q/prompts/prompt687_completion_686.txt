  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be `2`, which would include the second argument to `Q.fcall` in the array of arguments passed to `dispatch`, whereas the original code fragment would have passed only the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all arguments except the first two to `dispatch`, whereas the original code fragment would have passed only the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first two arguments to `dispatch`, whereas the original code fragment would have passed all arguments.

DONE.
