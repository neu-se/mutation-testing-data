  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"^"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would result in a different split of the stack string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"||"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would result in a different concatenation of the stack traces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would result in a different conditional statement.

DONE.
