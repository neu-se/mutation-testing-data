  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `+` would be applied to the value of `op`, which is a string, and the number 1, which would result in a new string with the value "op1".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `toUpperCase()` would be called on the string value of `op`, which would result in a new string with the value "OP".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the property `length` would be accessed on the string value of `op`, which would result in a number representing the length of the string.

DONE.
