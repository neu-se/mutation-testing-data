  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be off by 1 meter, which could have significant consequences in applications where precision is critical, such as in navigation or mapping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be double the actual distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be half the actual distance, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
