  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the existing value in the map with the new value, rather than merging the two values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.put
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new entry to the map with the given key and value, rather than merging the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.merge
```
This would result in different behavior because it would merge the two values into a single value, rather than replacing one value with the other.

DONE.
