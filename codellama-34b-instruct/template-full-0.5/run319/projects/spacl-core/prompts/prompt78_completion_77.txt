  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the `rules` array, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the rules in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method returns a new array containing all elements of the `rules` array except the first one, which would cause the `for...of` loop to skip over the first rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule of this.rules.filter((rule) => rule.name === 'allow')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array containing only the rules that have a `name` property equal to `'allow'`, which would cause the `for...of` loop to only iterate over the rules that have the
