  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isZero`, and it checks for a different condition. In the original code, `isZero` is used to check if the divisor is zero, and if it is, the result is `NaN`. However, if `isInfinite` is used instead, the result would be `Infinity` if the divisor is infinite, which is not the correct behavior.

DONE.
