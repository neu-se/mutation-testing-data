  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `null`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && attr[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attr[key]` is not `undefined`, while the new code fragment checks if it is not `null` and not `undefined`. This could potentially cause the function to behave differently in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && attr[key] !== undefined && attr[key] !== null && attr[key] !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code
