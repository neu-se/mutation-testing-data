  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise ? Promise.resolve(value) : Promise.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the deferred promise is fulfilled or rejected based on the presence or absence of `resolvedPromise`, respectively. However, in this modified code, the deferred promise is always fulfilled, regardless of whether `resolvedPromise` is present or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise && Promise.throw(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the deferred promise is rejected with the reason `value` if `!resolvedPromise` is true. However, in this modified code, the deferred promise is rejected with the reason `value` only if `resolvedPromise` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise = Promise.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the
