  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.nbind.apply(this, args)`, which would bind the function to the current object, while the new code fragment uses `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)`, which would bind the function to the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(this, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.nbind.apply(void 0, args)`, which would bind the function to the global object, while the new code fragment uses `Q.nbind.apply(this, args)`, which would bind the function to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.nbind.apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.n
