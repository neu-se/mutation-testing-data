  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in a compilation error because there is no `reject` identifier defined in the scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in an incorrect behavior because instead of rejecting the promise, the promise would resolve to the `unhandledReasons` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in an incorrect behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the `unhandledReasons` array as the reason, the promise would be rejected with the `Q` object as the reason.

DONE.
