  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `undefined`. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `callback` argument is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is not `null`. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `callback` argument is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `callback` argument is `undefined`, while this replacement checks if it is a function. This would cause the code to behave differently if the `callback` argument is not a function.

DONE.
