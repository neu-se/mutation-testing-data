  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, while `path.dirname` returns the directory portion of the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, while `path.relative` returns the relative path between the current and target paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, while `path.normalize` returns the normalized path.

DONE.
