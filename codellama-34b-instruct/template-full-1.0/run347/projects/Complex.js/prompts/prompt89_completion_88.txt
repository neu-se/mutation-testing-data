  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was trying to parse a string representing a number, but the new code fragment would always return the same infinite value, regardless of the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was trying to parse a string representing a number, but the new code fragment would always return an unexpected NaN value, regardless of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was trying to parse a string representing a number, but the new code fragment would always return 0, regardless of the input string.

DONE.
