  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `elem` by 1, which could cause the logic to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `elem`, which could cause the logic to behave differently for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `elem` by 1, which could cause the logic to behave differently for certain inputs.

DONE.
