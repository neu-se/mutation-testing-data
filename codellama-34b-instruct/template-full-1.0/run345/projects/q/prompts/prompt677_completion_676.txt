  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [this, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `"call"` is different from `"apply"` and would change the context of the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [object, []]
```
This would result in different behavior because it is passing an empty array as the second argument instead of `args`, which would result in the function being called without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [].concat(args)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it is concatenating `args` with an empty array and then passing it as the second argument to `"apply"`, which would result in the function being called with `args` as a single argument instead of as multiple arguments.

DONE.
