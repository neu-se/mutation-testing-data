  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(null)` would resolve the promise with a value of `null`, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve("foo")` would resolve the promise with a value of `"foo"`, whereas `Q` would resolve the promise with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
