  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected, rather than if it is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is not a promise, rather than if it is a promise and fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
snapshot.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending, rather than if it is fulfilled.

DONE.
