  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' ||
        (typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number or an object that is not null, while the new code fragment only checks if `op.retain` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'object' && op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.retain` is a number or an object that is not null, while the new code fragment only checks if `op.retain` is an object that is not null.
