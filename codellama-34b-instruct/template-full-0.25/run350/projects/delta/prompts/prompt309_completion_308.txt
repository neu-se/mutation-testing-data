  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation to the line, rather than the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(2));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next two operations to the line, rather than the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.next(3));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next three operations to the line, rather than the current operation.

DONE.
