  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `in` operator checks if the property is in the object, while `this.length` checks if the property is in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `>` operator checks if the property is greater than the length of the array, while `in` operator checks if the property is in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `<` operator checks if the property is less than the length of the array, while `in` operator checks if the property is in the object.

DONE.
