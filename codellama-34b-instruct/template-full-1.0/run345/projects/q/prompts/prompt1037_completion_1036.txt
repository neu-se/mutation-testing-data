  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer({
  head: value,
  tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a promise, but the code is trying to use it as an object with `head` and `tail` properties. This would result in an error when trying to access those properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` returns a promise that resolves to the given value, but the code is trying to use it as an object with `head` and `tail` properties. This would result in an error when trying to access those properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Promise.resolve({
  head: value,
  tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a promise
