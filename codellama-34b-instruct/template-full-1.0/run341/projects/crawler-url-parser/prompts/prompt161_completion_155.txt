  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path == pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the full paths of the two URLs, including the file names, instead of just the directory structures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_parts.length === pageurl_parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the number of directories in the two URLs, instead of the full directory structures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.endsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the full path of the second URL is a suffix of the full path of the first URL, instead of just comparing the directory structures.

DONE.
