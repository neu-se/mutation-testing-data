  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url, baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a different object with the `url` property set to the `url` property of the `currentUrl` and `baseUrl` objects, rather than the `currentUrl` and `baseUrl` objects themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl, baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a different object with the `url` property set to the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, rather than the `currentUrl` object.
