  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` would be incremented by 1, but the original code fragment would not modify the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 'Hello World'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'Hello World' would be concatenated with `value`, but the original code fragment would not perform any string manipulation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` would be multiplied by 2, but the original code fragment would not perform any multiplication.

DONE.
