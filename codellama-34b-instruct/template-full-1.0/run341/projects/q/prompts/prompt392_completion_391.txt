  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progressed.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed.bind(null)` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original `progressed` function with `null` as the `this` value, but the original code fragment does not perform this binding.
