  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(function () { return Q.reject(new Error("Test error")); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `put` method to reject with an error, which would cause the `get` method to throw an error and the `closed` promise to resolve with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(function () { return Q.resolve(null); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `put` method to resolve with a null value, which would cause the `get` method to return a null value and the `closed` promise to resolve with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(function () { return Q.resolve(Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `put` method to resolve with a promise that rejects with an error
