  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not called in the original code, so the `abort` callback would never be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` parameter is not passed to the `cb` function in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` parameter is not passed to the `cb` function in the original code.

DONE.
