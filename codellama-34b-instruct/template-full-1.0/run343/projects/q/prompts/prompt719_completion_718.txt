  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a `null` argument, which could potentially cause a `NullPointerException` in the `null` check in the `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with an incorrect argument, which could potentially cause the method to perform incorrect logic or return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined", null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with a `null` argument, which could potentially cause a `NullPointerException` in the `null` check in the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
