  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a circular reference, where the current timezone would be pushed onto its own all array, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a situation where the current timezone would be pushed onto its own all array, but the all array would not include any other timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ [country]: { current: [id], all: [tz.r] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a situation where the current timezone would be pushed onto an all array that includes the current timezone, but it would not include any other timezones.

DONE.
