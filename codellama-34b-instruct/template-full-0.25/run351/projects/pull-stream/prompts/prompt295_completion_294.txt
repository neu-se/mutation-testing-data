  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && true` will always evaluate to `true`, whereas `err || true` will evaluate to `true` only if `err` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err ? true : false` will always evaluate to `true` if `err` is truthy, whereas `err || true` will evaluate to `true` only if `err` is truthy or if `true` is passed as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because `!err` will always evaluate to `true` if `err` is falsy, whereas `err || true` will evaluate to `true` only if `err` is truthy or if `true` is passed as an argument.

DONE.
