  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get().fail()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail()` method is not a property of the `promise` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get().then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then()` method is not a property of the `promise` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get().catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch()` method is not a property of the `promise` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
