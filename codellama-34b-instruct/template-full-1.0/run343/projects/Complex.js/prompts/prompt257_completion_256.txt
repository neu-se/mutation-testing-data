  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, which is used in the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions, and would affect the output of the `expm1` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b / a` is the imaginary part of the complex number divided by the real part, which is not used in the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions, and would not affect the output of the `expm1` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is used in the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions, and would affect the output of the `expm1` function.

DONE.
