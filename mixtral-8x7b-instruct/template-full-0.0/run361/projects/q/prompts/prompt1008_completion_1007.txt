 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, but skips the first argument, which is the `name` variable in this context. The original code uses `array_slice(arguments, 1)`, which is an alias for `[].slice.call(arguments, 1)`, but directly replacing it with the latter form may cause issues if the `array_slice` function is overridden or not available.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(arguments)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to get the value of the second key in the `arguments` object, which is represented as a string (e.g., "1"). This is not equivalent to the original code, which correctly extracts the second argument as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.slice(1
