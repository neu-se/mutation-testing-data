  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `end` and `data` arguments, which is not what the original code does. The original code simply passes the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with the `data` and `end` arguments in reverse order, which is not what the original code does. The original code passes the `end` and `data` arguments to the `cb` function in that order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with only the `end` argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code passes both the `end` and `data` arguments
