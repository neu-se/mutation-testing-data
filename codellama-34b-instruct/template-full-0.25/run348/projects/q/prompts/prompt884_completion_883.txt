  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not a valid method for a promise, and would cause an error.

DONE.
