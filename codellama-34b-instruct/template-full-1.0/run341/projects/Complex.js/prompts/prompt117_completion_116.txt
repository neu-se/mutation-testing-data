  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the parameters in a specific order, but the mutated code uses them in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the parameters as-is, but the mutated code adds them together.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the parameters as-is, but the mutated code multiplies them together.

DONE.
