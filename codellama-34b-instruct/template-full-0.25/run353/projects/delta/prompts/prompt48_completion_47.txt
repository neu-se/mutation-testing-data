  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `embedType` is not equal to the first key in the `b` object, regardless of whether `embedType` is actually a key in the `b` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || !(embedType in b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is not a key in the `b` object, or if `embedType` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(embedType in b) || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `embedType` is not a key in the `b` object, or if `embedType` is not equal to the first key in the `b` object.
