Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument to `fs.readFile` would cause the file to be read without any encoding, potentially leading to unexpected results when the data is processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because explicitly setting the encoding to 'utf8' would override any encoding specified in the `options` object, which could lead to incorrect data being read if a different encoding was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding || 'ascii'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a default encoding of 'ascii' if none is provided would change how the file content is interpreted, potentially leading to data loss or corruption if the file contains non-ASCII characters.

DONE.
