  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the result of the `test` function. If the `test` function returns `true`, the `!test` expression would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which would return `false` if either operand is `false`. If the `test` function returns `true`, the `test && false` expression would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which would return `true` if either operand is `true`. If the `test` function returns `false`, the `test || true` expression would return `true`, and vice versa.
