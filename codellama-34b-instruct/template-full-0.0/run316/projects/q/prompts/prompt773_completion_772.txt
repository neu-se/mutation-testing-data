  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will always resolve the promise, regardless of the outcome of the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` will create a new deferred object, which can be used to create a new promise chain.

DONE.
