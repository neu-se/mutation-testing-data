  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `+` while the mutated code fragment uses `-`. This would cause the `acsch` function to return a different value, which could potentially cause issues in the test suite.
