  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` when `abort` is `true`, whereas the original code would return `abort` when it is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` when `abort` is `false`, whereas the original code would return `abort` when it is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` when `abort` is `false`, whereas the original code would return `abort` when it is `false`.

DONE.
