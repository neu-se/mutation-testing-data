  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.basename` returns the base name of a path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the extension of a path, while `path.basename` returns the base name of a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.sep
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.sep` returns the separator character used in a path, while `path.basename` returns the base name of a path.

DONE.
