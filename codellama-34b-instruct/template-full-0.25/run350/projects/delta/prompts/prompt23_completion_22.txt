  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the `key` property in `b` to the value of the `key` property in `a`, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of the `key` property in `a` to the value of the `key` property in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the `key` property in `a` to the value of the `key` property in `b`, whereas the original code fragment compares the value of the `key` property in `a` to the value of the `key` property in `b` and returns `null` if they are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of the `
