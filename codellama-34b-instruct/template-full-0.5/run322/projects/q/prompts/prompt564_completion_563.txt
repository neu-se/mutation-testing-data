  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason, while `resolve` is used to resolve a promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason, while `throw` is used to throw an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is used to reject a promise with a reason, while `return` is used to return a value.

DONE.
