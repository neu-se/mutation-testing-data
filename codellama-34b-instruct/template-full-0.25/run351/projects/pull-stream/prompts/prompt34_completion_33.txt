  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[1]`, which is the second element of the `args` array, instead of `ref[0]`, which is the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[length - 1]`, which is the last element of the `args` array, instead of `ref[0]`, which is the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function would be a random element from the `args` array, instead of `ref[0]`, which is the first element.

DONE.
