  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the second argument is now null, which would cause an error if the function expects a value to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, false]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the second argument is now false, which would cause the function to behave differently if it checks the value of the argument.

DONE.
