  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  cbed = true
  if(end = end || abort) {
    loop = false
    if(done) done(end === true ? null : end)
    else if(end && end !== true) {
      console.warn(doneLackingErr)
      throw end
    }
  }
  else if(op && false === op(data) || abort) {
    loop = false
    <PLACEHOLDER>(abort || true, done || function () {})
  }
  else if(!loop){
    next()
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code where `read` is called with `abort` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, function (end, data) {
  cbed
