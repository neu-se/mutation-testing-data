  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would be called with a value of `0` instead of `b`, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would be called with a value of `"foo"` instead of `b`, which would cause the result to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosm1` function would be called with a value of `b + 1` instead of `b`, which would cause the result to be different.

DONE.
