 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row['key'], row['val']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the properties using bracket notation instead of dot notation, which can lead to issues if the property names contain special characters or reserved words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(row.key), updater(this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `get` method to retrieve the value from the `_data` object, and also calls the `updater` function with the value from the current instance instead of the value from the row.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key + ',' + row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the key and value with a comma instead of passing them as separate arguments to the `_data.set` method.

DONE.
