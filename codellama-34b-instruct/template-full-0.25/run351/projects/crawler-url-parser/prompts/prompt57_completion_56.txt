  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all forward slashes from the URL, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\//g, '\\')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all forward slashes with backslashes, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/\//g, '\\/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all forward slashes with backslashes followed by a forward slash, which could cause issues with the URL parsing and formatting.

DONE.
