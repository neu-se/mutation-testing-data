  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `task.call(null)` would execute the `task` function in the global context, rather than in the context of the `head.next` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { return task; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that returns the `task` function, and then execute that function immediately. This would effectively do nothing, as the return value of the function is not being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function() { task; })()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that simply calls the `task` function, and then execute that function immediately. This would effectively do nothing, as the return value of the function is not being used.

DONE.
