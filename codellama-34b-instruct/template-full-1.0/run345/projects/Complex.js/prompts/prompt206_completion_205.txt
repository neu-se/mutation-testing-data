  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b, a```
This would result in different behavior because `b` and `a` are in the wrong order, causing the resulting complex number to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b, z['re']```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is being accessed from the `z` object, which is not defined in the code fragment provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```z['re'], b```
This would result in different behavior because `z['re']` is being accessed from the `z` object, which is not defined in the code fragment provided, and `b` is in the wrong position.

DONE.
