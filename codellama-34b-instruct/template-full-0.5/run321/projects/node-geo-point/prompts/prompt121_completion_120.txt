  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point) + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points and then adds 180 degrees to it. This would result in a bearing that is 180 degrees different from the original bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points, while this modified code calculates the bearing between two points and then multiplies it by 2. This would result in a bearing that is twice the original bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return GeoPoint.calculateBearing(this, point) - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calcul
