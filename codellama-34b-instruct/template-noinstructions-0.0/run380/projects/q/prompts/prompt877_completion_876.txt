  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing `undefined`, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array containing the arguments passed to the `nfapply` method.

DONE.
