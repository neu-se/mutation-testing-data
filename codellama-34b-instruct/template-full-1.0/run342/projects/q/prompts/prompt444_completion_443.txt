  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject("new rejection reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be called on the `promise` object, causing the promise to be rejected with the provided reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve("new resolution value")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method would be called on the `promise` object, causing the promise to be resolved with the provided value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("new rejection reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` method would be called, causing a new rejected promise to be created with the provided reason.

DONE.
