  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would check if `b` is null, whereas the original code fragment `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would check if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, whereas the original code fragment `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b.constructor === Object` would check if `b` has the `Object` constructor, whereas the original code fragment `typeof b !== 'object'` would check if `b` is not an object.

DONE.
