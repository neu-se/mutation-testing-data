  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct value from `value`, which could impact the logic of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string value, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a different type of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that returns `value`, which could potentially change the behavior of the function that is using the placeholder.

DONE.
