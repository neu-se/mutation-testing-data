  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` returns a function that takes a callback as its first argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that returns a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` returns a function that takes a callback as its first argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)` returns a function that takes a callback as its first argument, whereas `universalify.fromPromise` returns a function that returns a promise.

DONE.
