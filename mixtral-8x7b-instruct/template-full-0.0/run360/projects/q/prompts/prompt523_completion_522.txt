 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would return `null` instead of properly forwarding the operation to the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would always return an empty function instead of forwarding the operation to the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the fallback function would return an object with no prototype, which may cause issues with methods or properties that depend on the original object's prototype.

DONE.
