  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(nodeArgs[1], 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because "When an array is given as the second argument of array_slice, it converts the array to a string and then to an array."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(nodeArgs[1], 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because "Array.prototype.slice() method has access to the parent array's methods."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[1].slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because "When the slice() method takes one argument, it acts as if the second argument was omitted, so the resulting array contains all elements from the start index to the end of the array."

DONE.
