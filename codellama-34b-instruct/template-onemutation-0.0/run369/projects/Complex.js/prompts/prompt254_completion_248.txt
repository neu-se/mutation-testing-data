  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp(a)` is a function that returns the value of `e` raised to the power of `a`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the value of `e` raised to the power of the argument passed to it. In this case, the argument passed to `Math.exp` is `a`, which is a variable that contains the real part of the complex number. By using `Math.exp(a)` instead of `Math.exp`, the code would be raising `e` to the power of the real part of the complex number, which would result in a different value than the original code.

DONE.
