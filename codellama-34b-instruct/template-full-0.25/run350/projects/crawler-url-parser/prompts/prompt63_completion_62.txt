  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.hostname` is a string representing the hostname of the URL, while `ret.host` is an object representing the host and port of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host.hostname` is a string representing the hostname of the URL, while `ret.host` is an object representing the host and port of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.host.port
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.host.port` is a number representing the port of the URL, while `ret.host` is an object representing the host and port of the URL.

DONE.
