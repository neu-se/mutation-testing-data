  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function returns the cosine of a number, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sin` function returns the sine of a number, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.tan` function returns the tangent of a number, whereas `parseFloat` returns a floating-point number.

DONE.
