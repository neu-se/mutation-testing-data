Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially causing an "undefined" value to be accessed if the array is sparse, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < length + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run one additional iteration beyond the last valid index of the array, which could lead to accessing an out-of-bounds index and returning an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively change the loop condition to allow the last valid index to be processed, but it would also allow an attempt to access an index that does not exist if the array is empty, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
