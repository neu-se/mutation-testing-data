 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid argument for `array_slice()`, causing an exception and changing the flow of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `dispatch("apply", [...])` method, which could cause unexpected behavior depending on how the `dispatch` method handles different numbers or types of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
