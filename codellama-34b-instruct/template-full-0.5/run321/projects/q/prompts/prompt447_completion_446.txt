  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 42; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `42`, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("Test error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason `"Test error"`, rather than waiting for the promise to be fulfilled.

DONE.
