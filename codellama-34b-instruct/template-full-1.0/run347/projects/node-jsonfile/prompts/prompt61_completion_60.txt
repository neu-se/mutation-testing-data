  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, which would invert the result of `Buffer.isBuffer`. If `content` is a buffer, then `!Buffer.isBuffer` would return `false`, even though `Buffer.isBuffer` would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content).
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` would return a boolean value indicating whether `content` is a buffer, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` would return a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof content === 'Buffer'
```
This would result in different behavior because `content` is not guaranteed to be of type `Buffer`, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer(content)` would correctly identify whether `content` is a buffer or not.

DONE.
