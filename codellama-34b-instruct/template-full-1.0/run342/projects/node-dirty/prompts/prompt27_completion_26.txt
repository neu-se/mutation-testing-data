  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the entire data object instead of the "drain" event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the queue object instead of the "drain" event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the number of in-flight writes instead of the "drain" event.

DONE.
