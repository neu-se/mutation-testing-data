  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lines[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because `lines[0].length` would return the length of the first line, while `lines[0].indexOf` would return the index of the specified substring within the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line[0].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would return the uppercase version of the first line, while `indexOf` would return the index of the specified substring within the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line[0].includes('foo')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` would return a boolean indicating whether the first line includes the specified substring, while `indexOf` would return the index of the substring within the line.

DONE.
