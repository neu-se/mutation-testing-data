  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result` is a promise, and `result.value` would return the resolved value of the promise, which may not be the same as the original `result`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.then(function(value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.then` would return a new promise that resolves to the value returned by the callback function, which in this case is the original `result` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.catch(function(error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.catch` would return a new promise that resolves to the value returned by the callback function, which in this case is the original `result` value. If the promise is rejected, the callback function would throw an error, which would be caught by the `catch` method and returned as a rejected promise
