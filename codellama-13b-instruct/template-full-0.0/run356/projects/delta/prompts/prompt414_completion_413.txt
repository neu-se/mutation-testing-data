  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops.length` property is not the same as the `this.ops.length` property in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops.length - 1` expression is not the same as the `this.ops.length` expression in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.ops.length + 1` expression is not the same as the `this.ops.length` expression in the original code.

DONE.
