  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort(true)` would always abort the stream, whereas the original code would only abort the stream if `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort(false)` would never abort the stream, whereas the original code would abort the stream if `abort` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort(null)` would abort the stream if `abort` is null, whereas the original code would not abort the stream if `abort` is null.

DONE.
