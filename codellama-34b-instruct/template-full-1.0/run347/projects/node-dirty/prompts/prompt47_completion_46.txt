  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `cb`, would call the callback function if it is defined, while replacing it with `null` would prevent the callback from being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `cb`, would call the callback function if it is defined, while replacing it with `undefined` would prevent the callback from being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `cb`, would call the callback function if it is defined, while replacing it with `throw new Error()` would throw an error instead.

DONE.
