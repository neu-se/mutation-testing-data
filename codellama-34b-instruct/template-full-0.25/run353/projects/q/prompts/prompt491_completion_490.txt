  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `untrackRejection(rejection)`, which would untrack the rejection of the promise, while the new code fragment would untrack the rejection of `this`, which could be a different promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `untrackRejection(rejection)`, which would untrack the rejection of the promise, while the new code fragment would untrack the rejection of `promise`, which could be a different promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `untrackRejection(rejection)`, which would untrack the rejection of the promise, while the new code fragment would untrack the rejection of `null`, which would not have
