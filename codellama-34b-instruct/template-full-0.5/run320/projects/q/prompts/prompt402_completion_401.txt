  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(reason); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a new error object with the reason as the message, instead of throwing the reason directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return reason; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason instead of throwing it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the reason instead of being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw reason.message; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw the message of the reason instead of the reason itself, which could lead to a different exception being thrown and caught.

DONE.
