  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + b * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will add the angular displacement instead of comparing magnitudes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a - b * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will subtract the angular displacement instead of comparing magnitudes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it will double the angular displacement instead of comparing magnitudes.

DONE.
