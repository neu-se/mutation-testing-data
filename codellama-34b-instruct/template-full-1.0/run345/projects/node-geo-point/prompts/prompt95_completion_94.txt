  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
cosφ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinφ2` and `cosφ2` are related but not the same, so using `cosφ2` in place of `sinφ2` would cause the computation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are related but not the same, so using `sin(φ2)` in place of `sinφ2` would cause the computation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
acos(sinφ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `sin` are related but not the same, so using `acos(sinφ2)` in place of `sinφ2` would cause the computation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
