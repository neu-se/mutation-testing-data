  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is checking if the `done` variable is falsy, while `!done()` is checking if the result of calling the `done` function is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is checking if the `done` variable is falsy, while `done === false` is checking if the `done` variable is strictly equal to the boolean value `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!done` is checking if the `done` variable is falsy, while `done !== true` is checking if the `done` variable is not strictly equal to the boolean value `true`.

DONE.
