  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in an error because the `apply` method expects its first argument to be an array, but `undefined` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in an error because the `apply` method expects its first argument to be a function, but `null` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in an error because the `apply` method expects its first argument to be a function, but `{}` is an object.

DONE.
