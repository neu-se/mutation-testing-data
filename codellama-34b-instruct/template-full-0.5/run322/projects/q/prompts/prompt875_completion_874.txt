  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value passed to the `then` method, rather than the value returned by the `readFile` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error passed to the `then` method, rather than the error returned by the `readFile` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the value passed to the `then` method, rather than the value returned by the `readFile` method.

DONE.
