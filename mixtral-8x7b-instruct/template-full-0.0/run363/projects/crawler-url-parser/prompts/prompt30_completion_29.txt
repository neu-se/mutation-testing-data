 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'http' + currentUrlStr.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends 'http' to the currentUrlStr instead of using the correct replace method to add 'http://'. This could cause issues if the currentUrlStr already has 'http://' or 'https://', resulting in an incorrect URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'hto://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the '//' with 'hto' instead of 'http'. This would result in an invalid URL, causing issues in further processing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http:/')
