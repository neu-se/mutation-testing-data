  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new promise object, while "new Q" would create a new instance of the Q object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first argument, while "Q.all()" would return a promise that is resolved with an array of values if all of the provided promises are resolved, or rejected if any of the provided promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.denodeify()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first argument, while "Q.denodeify()" would return a function that takes a Node.js-style callback and returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the first argument passed to the callback.

DONE.
