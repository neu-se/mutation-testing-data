  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the negative of `b`. This could potentially cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, leading to a different result for the `tanh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the value of `b` plus one. This could potentially cause the `cosh` function to return a different value, leading to a different result for the `tanh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` directly, while the mutated code fragment uses the value of `b` multiplied by two. This could potentially cause the `cosh
