  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `baseUrlStr` is not empty and if it contains illegal characters, while this new code fragment checks if the `baseUrlStr` is not empty and if it contains illegal characters, but it also checks if the `baseUrlStr` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `baseUrlStr` is not empty and if it contains illegal characters, while this new code fragment checks if the `baseUrlStr` is not empty and if it contains illegal characters, but it also checks if the `baseUrlStr` is not null.
