```
var deferred = deffer();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is attempting to create a new deferred object, but the spelling of `deffer` is incorrect, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is attempting to create a new deferred object, but assigning it to `null` would result in a null pointer exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is attempting to create a new deferred object, but assigning it to `undefined` would result in a type error.

DONE.
