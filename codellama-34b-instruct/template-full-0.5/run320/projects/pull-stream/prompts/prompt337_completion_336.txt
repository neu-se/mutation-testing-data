  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` would always return a truthy value, whereas `prop` could return a falsy value if the property does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.toLowerCase()` would always return a string, whereas `prop` could return a number or a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop[0]` would always return the first character of the property value, whereas `prop` could return the entire property value.

DONE.
