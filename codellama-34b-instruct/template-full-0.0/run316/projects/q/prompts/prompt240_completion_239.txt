  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would never be entered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always defined, so the `if` statement would never be entered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always a non-zero value, so the `if` statement would never be entered.

DONE.
