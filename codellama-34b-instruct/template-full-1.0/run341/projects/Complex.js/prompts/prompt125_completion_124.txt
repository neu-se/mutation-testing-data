  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause both numbers to be set to infinity, resulting in an incorrect calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the first number is infinite, rather than checking if both numbers are infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the second number is infinite, rather than checking if both numbers are infinite.

Done.
