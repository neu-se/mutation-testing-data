  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the wrong value to the callback. In the original code, the value passed to the callback is `array[i++]`, but in this modified code, it is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, array[i--]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `true` to the callback instead of `null`, and it would also pass the value `array[i--]` instead of `array[i++]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false, array[i]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `false` to the callback instead of `null`, and it would also pass the value `array[i]` instead
