 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the global object, which may not be the same as the original `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` inside the `bound` function, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the method being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of `this` inside the `bound` function to the global object (in non-strict mode) or an error (in strict mode), potentially causing unexpected behavior in the method being called.

DONE.
