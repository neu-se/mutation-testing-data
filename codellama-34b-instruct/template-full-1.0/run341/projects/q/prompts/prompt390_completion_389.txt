  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called in the original code, but the `fulfilled` function is called in the mutated code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` function is called in the original code, but the `_rejected` function is called in the mutated code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if `null` is called in the mutated code.

DONE.
