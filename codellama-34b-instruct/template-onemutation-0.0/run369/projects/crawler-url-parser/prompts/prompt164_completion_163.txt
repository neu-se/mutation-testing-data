  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if the string starts with the given substring, while `includes` checks if the string contains the substring. In this case, the code is checking if the link URL path starts with the page URL path, which is a different check than checking if the link URL path includes the page URL path.
