  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match a dot or a dollar sign, while the buggy code fragment uses the same regular expression to match a dot or a dollar sign, but also includes a backslash before the dollar sign. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as when the input string contains a dollar sign followed by a digit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
