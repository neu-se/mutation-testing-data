  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first parameter passed to the function, whereas the original code returns the second parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first parameter passed to the function, whereas the original code returns the third parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the imaginary part of the complex number with the real part, which would alter the behavior of the function.

DONE.
