  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a < 3000 && _b > 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `_a` and `_b` are less than 3000, while the replacement code fragment checks if `_a` is less than 3000 and `_b` is greater than 3000.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_a` and `_b` are both less than 3000, while the replacement code fragment checks if their sum is less than 3000.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a > 3000 || _b < 3000
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `_a` is less than 3000 and `_b`
