  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the length of the second component instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the length of the third component instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
component[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the length of the fourth component instead of the first.

DONE.
