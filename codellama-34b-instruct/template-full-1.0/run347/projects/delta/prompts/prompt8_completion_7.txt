  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes [key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the presence of a key in the `attributes` object rather than the value being `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes [key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the value being `null` rather than being present in the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes [key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the value being `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
