Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `rule[1]` as a string instead of executing the function if it is one, which would prevent the correct pluralization logic from being applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the function to a string representation instead of executing it, leading to incorrect results when a function is expected to be called for pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) ? rule[1] : 'default'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a fallback string 'default' if the regex test fails, which would override the intended pluralization logic and return 'default' instead of the correct plural form.

DONE.
