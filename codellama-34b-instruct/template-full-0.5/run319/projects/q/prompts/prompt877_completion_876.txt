  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, instead of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array that is the result of merging the given array with the array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method returns a new array that is the result of merging the given array with the array of arguments.

DONE.
