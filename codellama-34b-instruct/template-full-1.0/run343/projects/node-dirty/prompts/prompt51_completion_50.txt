  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.get` is used to retrieve a value from a map, while `this.set` is used to set a value in a map. If `this.set` is used in place of `this.get`, it could cause the code to store a new value in the map instead of retrieving the existing value, which could lead to unintended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid key in a map, and using it as a key would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete this._data[key]` would remove the key-value pair from the map, while `this.get(key)` would simply return the value associated with the key.

DONE.
