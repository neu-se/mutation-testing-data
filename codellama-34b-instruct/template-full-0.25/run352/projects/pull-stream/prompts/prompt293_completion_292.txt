  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'string' === typeof test
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test === '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `test` is a number, while this new code fragment checks if `test` is equal to the string '0'.

DONE.
