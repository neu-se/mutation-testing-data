Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `retain` property of `newOp` to `0`, which may lead to unexpected behavior when composing operations, as it effectively indicates that no characters should be retained, potentially altering the intended operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = thisOp.insert + " modified";
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string " modified" to the `insert` property of `newOp`, changing the content that is being inserted and potentially altering the final output of the composed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `delete` property of `newOp` to `1`, which indicates that one character should be deleted instead of preserving the operation, leading to a loss of data that was intended to be retained.

DONE.
