  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 would cause the code to skip over the last operation in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 would cause the code to skip over the last operation in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the current operation, and adding 1 would cause the code to include an extra operation in the iteration.

DONE.
