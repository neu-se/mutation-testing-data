  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/` matches a string that does not start with a protocol (e.g. "http://", "https://", etc.), and the replacement string "http://" adds the protocol to the beginning of the string. In the original code, the regular expression is used to test whether the string starts with a protocol, and the replacement string is not used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/` matches a string that does not start with a protocol (e.g. "http://", "https://", etc.), and the replacement string "" removes the protocol from the beginning of the string. In the
