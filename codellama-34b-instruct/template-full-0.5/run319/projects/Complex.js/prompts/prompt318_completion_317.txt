  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but `-b` is the negative of that variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but `b + 1` is the result of adding 1 to that variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, but `Math.sin(b)` is the sine of that variable.

DONE.
