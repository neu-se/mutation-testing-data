  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, instead of an array with the specified arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the first two arguments instead of the last two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array with the first argument instead of the last argument.

DONE.
