  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
assertTrue(callback === 42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fcall` method is used to call the `callback` function, while `assertTrue` is used to test the truthiness of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(callback())
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is used to call the `callback` function, while `resolve` is used to resolve the promise with the return value of the `callback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("Callback is not a function"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is used to call the `callback` function, while `reject` is used to reject the promise with a new error object.

DONE.
