  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that should be called with the progressed value, whereas this code fragment would result in a function being called with no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` takes a single argument and returns a value, whereas this code fragment takes no arguments and returns a function that returns the same value, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return Q(function () { return; }); }
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that takes no arguments and returns a promise, whereas this code fragment returns a function that returns a promise that wraps a function that takes no arguments and returns undefined, which could result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
