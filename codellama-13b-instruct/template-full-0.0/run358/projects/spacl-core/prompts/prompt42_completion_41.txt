  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the string to uppercase, which would affect the behavior of the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the string to lowercase, which would affect the behavior of the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove all letters from the string, which would affect the behavior of the regular expression.

DONE.
