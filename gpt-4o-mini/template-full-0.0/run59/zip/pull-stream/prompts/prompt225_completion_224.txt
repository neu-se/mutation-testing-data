Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the negation operator, causing the function to return true for inputs that pass the test instead of false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return false regardless of the test result, effectively ignoring the input data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) || true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return true, regardless of whether the test passes or fails, thus making the filter ineffective.

DONE.
