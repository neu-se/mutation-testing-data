  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` is a reference to the constructor function of the current object, whereas `this` is a reference to the current object.

DONE.
