  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to b would change the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of a by 2 would change the result of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from a would change the result of the expression.

DONE.
