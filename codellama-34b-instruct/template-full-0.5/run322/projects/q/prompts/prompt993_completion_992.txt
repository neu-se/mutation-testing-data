  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new promise, but `defer(null, null)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `null`. This would cause the `fail` method to not be called, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null, undefined)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `undefined`. This would cause the `fail` method to not be called, even if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null, false)` would return a promise that is already resolved with the value `false`. This would cause the `fail` method to not be called, even if the promise is rejected.
