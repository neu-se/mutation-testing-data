  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.substring(1)` would return the substring of `url` starting from the second character, whereas `url` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.toLowerCase()` would return the lowercase version of `url`, whereas `url` would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.split(":")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.split(":")[1]` would return the substring of `url` after the first colon, whereas `url` would return the entire string.

DONE.
