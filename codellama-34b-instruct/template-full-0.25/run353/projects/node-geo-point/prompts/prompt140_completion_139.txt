  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude instead of the longitude, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the longitude, which could cause errors in the calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude, which could cause errors in the calculations.

DONE.
