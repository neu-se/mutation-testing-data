  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a method that returns a new array, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` is a method that removes the last element of an array and returns it, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `join` is a method that returns a string.

DONE.
