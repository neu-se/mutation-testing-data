Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the `Q` library to the `Promise` constructor, which may not have the same methods or properties, potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately return a rejected promise instead of the original object, which alters the intended flow of the function and may cause the calling code to handle errors differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a resolved promise with the original object, which changes the semantics of the function from potentially handling asynchronous operations to immediately resolving, thus bypassing any intended asynchronous behavior.

DONE.
