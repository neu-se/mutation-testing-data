  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of keys from the `b` object, while the original code fragment returned an object with keys and values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of values from the `b` object, while the original code fragment returned an object with keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the number of keys in the `b` object, while the original code fragment returned an object with keys and values.

DONE.
