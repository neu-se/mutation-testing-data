  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always throw an error, regardless of the value of the `shouldThrow` option.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(shouldThrow)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null, regardless of the value of the `shouldThrow` option.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(shouldThrow ? true : false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite value of the `shouldThrow` option, regardless of its value.

DONE.
