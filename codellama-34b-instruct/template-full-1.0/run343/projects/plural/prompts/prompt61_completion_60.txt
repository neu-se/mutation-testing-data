  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule with a constant result of "0" for the word "criterion", instead of the expected result of "criteria".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule with a constant result of "NaN" (Not a Number) for the word "criterion", instead of the expected result of "criteria".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule with a constant result of "criterion" for the word "criterion", instead of the expected result of "criteria".

DONE.
