  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` and `deferred.reject` are different methods, and the `all` function expects to receive a rejected promise to terminate the `pendingCount` for a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.reject` are different methods, and the `all` function expects to receive a rejected promise to terminate the `pendingCount` for a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.always
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.always` is a different method than `deferred.reject` and the `all` function does not handle this case, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
