  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to receive an undefined value as its first argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to receive a null value as its first argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the dispatch method to receive a falsey value as its first argument, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
