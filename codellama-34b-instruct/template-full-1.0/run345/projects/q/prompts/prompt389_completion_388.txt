  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that returns a promise rejected with the given reason, whereas `fulfilled` is a promise that is already fulfilled. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newValue
```
This would result in different behavior because `newValue` is a variable that contains the fulfilled value of the promise, whereas `fulfilled` is a function that returns a promise fulfilled with the given value. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is the exception thrown from the rejection callback, whereas `fulfilled` is a promise that is already fulfilled.

DONE.
