  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` callback would not be called, which could cause issues if the code relies on it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` callback would not be called, which could cause issues if the code relies on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled, progress
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callbacks would be reversed, which could cause issues if the code relies on the specific order.

DONE.
