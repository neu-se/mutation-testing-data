  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice(1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas `ref` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.concat([])` would return a new array with the elements of `ref` followed by an empty array, whereas `ref` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })` would return a new array with each element incremented by 1, whereas `ref` would return the original array.

DONE.
