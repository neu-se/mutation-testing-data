  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://" only if it is not already present in the URL, while this modified code fragment replaces it with "https://" regardless of whether it is already present or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://" only if it is not already present in the URL, while this modified code fragment replaces it with "http://www." regardless of whether it is already present or not. Additionally, this modified code fragment adds the "www." subdomain to the URL, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\
