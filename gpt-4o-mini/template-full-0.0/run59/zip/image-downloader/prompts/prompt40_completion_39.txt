Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'error.txt' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the destination filename to a hardcoded value ('error.txt'), which means the file will always be saved as 'error.txt' regardless of the intended destination specified by the `dest` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the filename to be in uppercase, which could lead to issues on case-sensitive file systems, potentially overwriting existing files or failing to save correctly if the original filename had a different case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '.bak' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends '.bak' to the filename, which means the file will be saved with a different extension, potentially causing confusion about the file type and how it should be handled by other processes or applications.

DONE.
