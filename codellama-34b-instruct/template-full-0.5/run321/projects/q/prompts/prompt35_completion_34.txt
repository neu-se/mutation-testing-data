  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("oops");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to throw an error, which would not happen with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextTick` function to return early, which would not happen with the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would schedule the `flush` function to be called after a delay of 1 second, which would not happen with the original code.

DONE.
