  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument in the `arguments` array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments in the `arguments` array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments in the `arguments` array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
