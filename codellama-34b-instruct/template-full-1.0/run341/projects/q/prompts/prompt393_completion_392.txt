  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return `null` instead of a promise, which would likely break any code that expects a promise to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return `undefined` instead of a promise, which would likely break any code that expects a promise to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return a promise that resolves to `Q` instead of a promise that resolves to `undefined`, which would likely break any code that expects a promise to be returned and then resolves to `undefined`.

DONE.
