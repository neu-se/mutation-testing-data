  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, but this replacement code fragment does not use any conversion function, which could cause the calculation to produce incorrect results if the longitude values are not already in radians.

DONE.
