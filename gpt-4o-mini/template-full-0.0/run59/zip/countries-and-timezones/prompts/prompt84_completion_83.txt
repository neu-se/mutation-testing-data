Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknown'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always attempt to get a country with the ID 'unknown', which likely does not exist in the data, leading to a consistent return of `null` instead of the actual country associated with the timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `id` property of the country object `c`, which may not exist, potentially leading to an error or returning `undefined` instead of the expected country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `name` property of the country object `c` instead of the `id`, which would likely not match the expected country ID format, resulting in a failure to retrieve the correct country.

DONE.
