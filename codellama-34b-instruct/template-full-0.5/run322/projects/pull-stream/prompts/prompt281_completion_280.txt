  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `mapper`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `mapper` is a truthy value, and `false` when it is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would add 1 to the value of `mapper`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `mapper` is a truthy value, and `false` when it is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would multiply the value of `mapper` by 2, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `mapper` is a truthy value
