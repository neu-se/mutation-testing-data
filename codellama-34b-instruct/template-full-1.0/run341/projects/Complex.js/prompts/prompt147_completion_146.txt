  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while this replacement checks if the real part is greater than the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while this replacement checks if the real part is greater than zero and the imaginary part is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(b === 0 && a > 0) || (b !== 0 && a === 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, while this replacement checks if the real part is greater than zero or the imaginary part is non-zero.

DONE.
