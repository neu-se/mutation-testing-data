Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `href` value to uppercase, potentially causing issues with URL matching and parsing, as URLs are case-sensitive in certain contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + '?test=true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a query parameter to the `href`, altering the original URL and potentially affecting how it is parsed and processed in subsequent logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').replace('http', 'ftp')
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the protocol from `http` to `ftp`, which could lead to invalid URLs being processed, as the `parse` function may not handle `ftp` URLs correctly.

DONE.
