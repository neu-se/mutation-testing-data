  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different object than `otherOp`, and it may not have the same methods or properties as `otherOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have any methods or properties, so it would cause an error if used in the same way as `otherOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have any methods or properties, so it would cause an error if used in the same way as `otherOp`.

DONE.
