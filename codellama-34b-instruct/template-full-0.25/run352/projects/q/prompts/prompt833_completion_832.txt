  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved with the result of the `progress` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause it to behave differently than if it were called with the correct argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with `0` as an argument, which may cause it to behave differently than if it were called with the correct argument.

DONE.
