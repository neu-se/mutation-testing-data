  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is being called with `null` as its first argument, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(undefined, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is being called with `undefined` as its first argument, which is not the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
drain(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is being called with `null` as both its first and second arguments, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
