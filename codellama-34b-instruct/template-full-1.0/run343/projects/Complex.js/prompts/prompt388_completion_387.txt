  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than expected, depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than expected, depending on the input.

DONE.
