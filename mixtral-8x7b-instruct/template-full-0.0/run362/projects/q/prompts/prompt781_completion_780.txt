 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would not be called, and an empty object would be returned instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy!'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of the `inspect()` method being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (value) { return value; }
