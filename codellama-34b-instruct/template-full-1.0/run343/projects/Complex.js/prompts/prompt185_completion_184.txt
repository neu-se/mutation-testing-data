  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.sqrt` are different functions with different expected inputs and outputs. While `Math.pow(a, b)` returns the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`, `Math.sqrt(a)` returns the square root of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` and `Math.log` are different functions with different expected inputs and outputs. While `Math.pow(a, b)` returns the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`, `Math.log(a, b)` returns the natural logarithm of `a` with base `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(a, b) { return a + b; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function used here returns the sum of `a
