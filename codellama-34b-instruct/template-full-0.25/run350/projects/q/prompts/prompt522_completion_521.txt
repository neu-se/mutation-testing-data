  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `rejected` is a truthy value. If `rejected` is replaced with `null`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which would result in the promise being rejected with the value of `reason`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and `rejected` is a truthy value. If `rejected` is replaced with `undefined`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`, and the `else` block would be executed, which would result in the promise being rejected with the value of `reason`.
