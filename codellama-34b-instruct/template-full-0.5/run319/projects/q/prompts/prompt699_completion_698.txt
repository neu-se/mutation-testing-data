  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0]` would return the first element of the `args` array, whereas `arguments, 1` would return the second element of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would return the length of the `args` array, whereas `arguments, 1` would return the second element of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[1]` would return the second element of the `args` array, whereas `arguments, 1` would return the first element of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
