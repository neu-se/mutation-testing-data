 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify(newValue);` line would always be executed, even if an exception was thrown in the `_progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify(newValue);` line would never be executed, even if no exception was thrown in the `_progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify(newValue);` line would only be executed if `threw` is explicitly set to `false`, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
