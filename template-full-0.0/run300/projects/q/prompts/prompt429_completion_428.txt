  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(this, "rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not defined on the `object` and would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
