  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("\n")
```
This code fragment splits the stack string into an array of lines, which is the expected behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split(" ")
```
This code fragment splits the stack string into an array of words, which is different from the expected behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackString.split("")
```
This code fragment splits the stack string into an array of characters, which is different from the expected behavior of the original code.

DONE.
