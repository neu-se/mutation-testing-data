  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would result in the plural form `'dice'` being returned, while the new code fragment would return the singular form `'die'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would result in the plural form `'dice'` being returned, while the new code fragment would return the plural form `'dices'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'dice'`, which would result in the plural form `'dice'` being returned, while the new code fragment would return the plural form `'dices'`.

DONE.
