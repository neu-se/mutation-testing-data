  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while the new code fragment would always call `cb` with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while the new code fragment would always call `cb` with an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is truthy before calling it, while the new code fragment would always call `cb` with a no-op function.

DONE.
