  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify()` is used to notify progress listeners, but `deferred.resolve()` is used to resolve the promise with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(value)` returns a promise that is resolved with `value`, but `deferred.resolve()` is used to resolve the promise with `value` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise with `value` as the reason, but `deferred.resolve()` is used to resolve the promise with `value`.

DONE.
