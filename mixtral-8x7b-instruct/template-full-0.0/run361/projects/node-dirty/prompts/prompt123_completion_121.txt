 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not call the `_flush` function, but instead assigns its value to `_writeStream.uncork()`. This change would cause the `_flush` function to be called immediately, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, will have its `this` keyword set to the provided value (in this case, `this` refers to the `Dirty` instance). By assigning the bound function to `_writeStream.uncork()`, the `_flush` method will be called with the `Dirty` instance as its `this` value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush.call(null)
```
