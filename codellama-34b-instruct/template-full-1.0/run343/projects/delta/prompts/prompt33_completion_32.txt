  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key] !== attr[key] && base[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks whether the operands have the same value but different types, whereas the `===` operator checks whether the operands have the same value and type. In this case, if `base[key]` is a different type from `attr[key]`, the `!==` operator will still return `true`, even if the values are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] !== base[key] && base[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks whether the operands have the same value but different types, whereas the `===` operator checks whether the operands have the same value and type.
