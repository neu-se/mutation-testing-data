 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the second-to-last operation in the `other` Delta instead of the last operation, potentially causing the `concat` method to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the entire `other.ops` array, which is unnecessary and could potentially impact performance. The original code fragment only copies the second and subsequent operations, assuming that the first operation has already been processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first operation in the `other` Delta, potentially causing the `concat` method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
