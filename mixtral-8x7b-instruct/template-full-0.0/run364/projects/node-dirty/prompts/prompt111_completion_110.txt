 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Error: Corrupted row at the end of the db'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object constructor is not being called, which could affect how the error is handled or logged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Corrupted row at the beginning of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message is now saying that the corrupted row is at the beginning of the db, rather than the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new TypeError('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because a TypeError is being thrown instead of a generic Error. This could affect how the error is handled or logged, and could indicate a different type of problem to the developer.

DONE.
