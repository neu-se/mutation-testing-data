  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx,
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra comma at the end of the argument list, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `matches` method, which would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `matches` method, which would cause a type error.

DONE.
