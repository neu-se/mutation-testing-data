  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src
```
This would result in different behavior because `src` and `targetFilePath` are different variables and may have different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `src.substr(1)` is a substring of `src` and may not match the expected filename.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'not-a-file.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'not-a-file.txt'` is a different file name than what was expected.

DONE.
