  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only access the first element of the `coordinates` array, whereas the original code fragment accesses the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the `coordinates` array except the first one, whereas the original code fragment accesses the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `coordinates` array, whereas the original code fragment accesses the elements of the array.

DONE.
