  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` is a different function from `URL.parse` and would produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` is a different function from `URL.parse` and would produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl.href, parsedUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` is a different function from `URL.resolve` and would produce a different output.

DONE.
