  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a constant, whereas `resolvedPromise` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (resolvedPromise === null) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `===` is a strict equality comparison operator, whereas `==` is a non-strict equality comparison operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.fulfill` is a method that fulfills the promise with the given value, whereas `promise.resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with the given value.

DONE.
