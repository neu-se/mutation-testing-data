Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to compare the `insert` property of `thisOp` instead of `otherOp`, potentially leading to incorrect operations being performed during the diff process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `null`, causing the condition to always be false and skipping the retain operation entirely, which could lead to data loss in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the `delete` property of `otherOp` instead of `otherOp.insert`, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations, especially if `otherOp.delete` is defined but `otherOp.insert` is not.

DONE.
