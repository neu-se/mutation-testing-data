  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` function is called with the `test` variable as an argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment `test`. This would cause the `tester` function to be called with a different argument, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` function is called with the result of adding 1 to the `test` variable as an argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment `test`. This would cause the `tester` function to be called with a different argument, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester(test - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tester` function is called with the result of subtracting 1 from the `test` variable as
