Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat any object (including arrays and null) as valid options, potentially leading to unexpected results when the options are expected to be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for null values, allowing any other type (including strings, numbers, etc.) to pass through, which could lead to errors when the function expects a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only accept options that are arrays, rejecting valid string options and causing the function to fail when it should process a string encoding.

DONE.
