Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting the promise with the error, it would resolve the promise, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the consumers of the queue that expect an error when trying to access a closed queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` would create a queue end that does not contain any error information, which could lead to consumers of the queue not being able to handle the closure properly, as they would not receive any indication of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would similarly create a queue end that does not provide any error information, which could cause confusion or errors in the logic that expects a valid error object when the queue is closed.

DONE.
