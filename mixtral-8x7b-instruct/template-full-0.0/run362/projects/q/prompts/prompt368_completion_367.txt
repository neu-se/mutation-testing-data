 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the deferred promise with the rejected exception, it would create a new rejected promise, breaking the expected error propagation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not call the `_rejected` function, and the error would not be properly handled, causing unexpected behavior or unhandled rejection warnings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly reject the deferred promise, bypassing the `_rejected` function and its error handling and possible side effects, which could lead to unexpected behavior or incomplete error handling.

DONE.
