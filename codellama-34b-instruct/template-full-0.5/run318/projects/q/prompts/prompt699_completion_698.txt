  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array with the first two elements of `arguments` removed, whereas `arguments, 1` would return the second element of `arguments`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 1, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)` would return an array with the first two elements of `arguments`, whereas `arguments, 1` would return the second element of `arguments`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(array_slice(arguments, 2, 3))
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2, 3)` would return an array with the third and fourth elements of `arguments`, whereas `arguments, 1
