  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [undefined, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" method is not defined on the `Q` object, and it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [undefined, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the "call" method is not defined on the `Q` object, and it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("bind", [undefined, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the "bind" method is not defined on the `Q` object, and it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
