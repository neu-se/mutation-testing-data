  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    "0"
```
This would result in an infinite loop because the timeout would never be cleared, and the promise would never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Infinity
```
This would result in the promise never being resolved because the timeout would be set to an infinite amount of time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    NaN
```
This would result in the promise never being resolved because the timeout would be set to a non-numeric value, which would cause an error.

DONE.
