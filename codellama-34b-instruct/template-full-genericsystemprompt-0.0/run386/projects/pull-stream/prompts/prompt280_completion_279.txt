  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes a single argument to the `mapper` function, while this new code fragment passes two arguments. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a non-null value to the `mapper` function, while this new code fragment passes a null value. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a non-undefined value to the `mapper` function, while this new code fragment passes an undefined value. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to
