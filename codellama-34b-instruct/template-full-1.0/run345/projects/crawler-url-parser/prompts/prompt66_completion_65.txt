  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=", 1)[0].split("&").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it only counts the number of parameters in the query string, rather than the number of key-value pairs. This would cause the `querycount` variable to be incorrect if the query string contains multiple values for the same key, or if the values are not in the format of `key=value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(parsedUrl.search.split("&")).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it counts the number of keys in the query string, rather than the number of key-value pairs. This would cause the `querycount` variable to be incorrect if the query string contains multiple values for the same key, or if the keys are not in the format of `key=value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=").length
```
