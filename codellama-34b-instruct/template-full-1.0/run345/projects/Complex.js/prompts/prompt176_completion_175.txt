  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to always be zero, leading to a division by zero error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to always be one, leading to a constant result regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the denominator to always be negative one, leading to a result that is constant and opposite to the original.

DONE.
