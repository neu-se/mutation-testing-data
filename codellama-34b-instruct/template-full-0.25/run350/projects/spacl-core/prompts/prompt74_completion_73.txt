  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== false` would return `true` if `res` is not equal to `false`, whereas the original code `res === false` would return `true` only if `res` is equal to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because `!res` would return the opposite of `res`, whereas the original code `res === false` would return `true` only if `res` is equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res == true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res == true` would return `true` if `res` is equal to `true`, whereas the original code `res === false` would return `true` only if `res` is equal to `false`.

DONE.
