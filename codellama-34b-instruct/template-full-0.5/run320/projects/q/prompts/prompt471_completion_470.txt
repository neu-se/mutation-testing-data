  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], unhandledReasons[at]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the same reason twice, which could cause the process to misinterpret the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", reason, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a different reason than the one that was originally emitted, which could cause the process to misinterpret the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null value as the reason, which could cause the process to misinterpret the state of the promise.

DONE.
