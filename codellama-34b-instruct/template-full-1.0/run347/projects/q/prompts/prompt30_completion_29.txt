  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, whereas `pop()` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - 1` would give the index of the last element in the array, whereas `pop()` returns the last element itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of the array, whereas `pop()` removes the last element.

DONE.
