  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if the `retain` property is not null, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if the `retain` property is null, which would lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the opposite of the original value, which would lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
