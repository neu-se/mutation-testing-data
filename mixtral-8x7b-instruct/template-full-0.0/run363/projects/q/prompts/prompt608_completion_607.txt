 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method does not expect `null` as the second argument and might throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `length` property or trying to iterate over the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method might behave differently when receiving an empty array instead of the actual arguments. It could lead to unexpected results or errors, depending on how the `dispatch` method is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ length: 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method does not expect an object with a `length` property as the second argument. This might cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently, leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
