  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word and then changes the 'a' to 'i'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion', 'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds an 's' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds 's' to the end of the word and then changes the 'a' to 'i'.

DONE.
