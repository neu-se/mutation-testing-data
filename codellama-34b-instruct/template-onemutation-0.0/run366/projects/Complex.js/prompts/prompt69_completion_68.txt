  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new SyntaxError('Invalid Param'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws a `SyntaxError` with a message of `'Invalid Param'`, while the mutated code fragment throws a `SyntaxError` with a message of `'Invalid Param'` and a stack trace that includes the line number where the error occurred.
