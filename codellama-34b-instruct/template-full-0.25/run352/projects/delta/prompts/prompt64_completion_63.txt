  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops` is an array, and `this.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.length` is a number, and `this.push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.ops.pop()` removes the last element from the array, and `this.push` adds an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
