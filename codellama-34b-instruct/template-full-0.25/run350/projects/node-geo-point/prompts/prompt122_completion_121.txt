  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the method to return `null` instead of the expected `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the method to return `undefined` instead of the expected `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `this` keyword to refer to the current object, but replacing it with an empty object would cause the method to return an empty object instead of the expected `GeoPoint` object.

DONE.
