  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would only take the first argument, `name`, and not the second argument, `args`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to be called with only one argument, which would likely result in an error.
