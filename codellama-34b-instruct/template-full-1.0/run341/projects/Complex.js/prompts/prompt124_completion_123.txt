  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sub` method to always return `NaN` instead of only returning `NaN` when `this` is an infinite complex number and `z` is not an infinite complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sub` method to always return `Infinity` instead of only returning `Infinity` when `this` is an infinite complex number or `z` is not an infinite complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] - z['re'], this['im'] - z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sub` method to always return a new complex number representing the difference between `this` and `z` instead of only returning `Infinity` when `this` is
