  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because void 0 is a valid but falsey value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a valid but falsey value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a valid but falsey value, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

DONE.
