  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Oops!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than resolving with a value as the original code would have done.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with `undefined`, rather than a value as the original code would have done.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Error!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, rather than resolving with a value as the original code would have done.

DONE.
