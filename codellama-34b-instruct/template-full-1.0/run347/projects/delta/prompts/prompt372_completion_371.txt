  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.sum
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.sum` returns the sum of the lengths of the operations in a delta, whereas `Op.length` returns the length of a single operation. If a delta has more than one operation, using `Op.length` would only return the length of the first operation, whereas using `Op.sum` would return the sum of the lengths of all the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.count
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.count` returns the number of operations in a delta, whereas `Op.length` returns the length of a single operation. If a delta has more than one operation, using `Op.count` would return the number of operations, whereas using `Op.length` would return the length of the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.first
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.first` returns the first operation in
