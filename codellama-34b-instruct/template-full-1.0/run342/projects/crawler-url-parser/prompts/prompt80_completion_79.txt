  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', 'example.com');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the href attribute of the link to "example.com", which may cause the link to point to a different URL than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).removeAttr('href');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the href attribute from the link, which may cause the link to not be clickable or to open the current page rather than the intended link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href', '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the href attribute of the link to an empty string, which may cause the link to not be clickable or to open the current page rather than the intended link.

DONE.
