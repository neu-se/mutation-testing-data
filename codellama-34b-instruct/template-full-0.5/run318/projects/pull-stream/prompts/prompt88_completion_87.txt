  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is a boolean negation operator, which would flip the truthiness of the `prop` variable. If `prop` is truthy, `!prop` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` would increment the value of `prop` by 1. If `prop` is a number, this would change its value. If `prop` is a string, this would concatenate the string with the number 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.toUpperCase()` would convert the value of `prop` to uppercase. If `prop` is a string, this would change its value. If `prop` is not a string, this would throw an error.
