  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second character. In the original code, the `content` variable is passed as-is to the `JSON.parse` method, which would parse the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second character and ending at the end of the string. In the original code, the `content` variable is passed as-is to the `JSON.parse` method, which would parse the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the second
