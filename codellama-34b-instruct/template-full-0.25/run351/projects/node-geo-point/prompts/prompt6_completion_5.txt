  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type = 'LineString'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `type` property of the `point` object to be `'Point'`, but by changing it to `'LineString'`, the method would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [0, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the `coordinates` property of the `point` object to be an array of two numbers, but by changing it to `[0, 0]`, the method would throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a `GeoPoint` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates = [100, 100]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromGeoJSON` method expects the
