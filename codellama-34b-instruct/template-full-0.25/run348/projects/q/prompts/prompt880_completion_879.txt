  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and a bound argument, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called with a different context and argument list than it was originally called with.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific `this` value and arguments, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called with a different context and argument list than it was originally called with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(deferred, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` calls a function with a specific `this` value and an array of arguments, which would cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called with a
