  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` and `illnesses` arrays are not concatenated in the original code, and the resulting array would be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` array is sliced to remove the last element, which would change the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.filter(function(word) { return word.length > 5 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` array is filtered to only include words with a length greater than 5, which would change the resulting array.

DONE.
