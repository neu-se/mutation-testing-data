  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if there are no more operations to iterate over, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
