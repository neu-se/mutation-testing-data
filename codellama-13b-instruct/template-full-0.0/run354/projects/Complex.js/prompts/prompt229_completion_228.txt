  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2.0 * (r + a)` is used in the original code, which is not the same as `2.0 * (r - a)`. The former expression is used to calculate the real part of the square root, while the latter expression is used to calculate the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2.0 * (r + a)` is used in the original code, which is not the same as `2.0 * (r + b)`. The former expression is used to calculate the real part of the square root, while the latter expression is used to calculate the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2.0
