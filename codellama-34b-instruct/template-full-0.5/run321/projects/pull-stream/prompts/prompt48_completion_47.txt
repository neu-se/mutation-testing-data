  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to run fewer times or skip over certain elements in the `arguments` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of by 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain elements in the `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would assign the value of `i + 1` to `i` instead of incrementing `i` directly, potentially causing the loop to run fewer times or skip over certain elements in the `arguments` array.

DONE.
