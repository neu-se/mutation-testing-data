 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat any input with an 'i' or 'I' character as a NaN value, even if the rest of the input is valid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error, which would prevent the function from returning a valid complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['im'] = parseFloat(c + 'i');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always append an 'i' character to the imaginary component, even if the input does not include one. This could lead to incorrect results when parsing complex numbers.

DONE.
