  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearerValue` is always a promise, so the `valueOf` method would always return a promise, even if the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a method that checks if a promise is resolved, and if it is, it returns the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.isRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a method that checks if a promise is rejected, and if it is, it returns the rejection reason.

DONE.
