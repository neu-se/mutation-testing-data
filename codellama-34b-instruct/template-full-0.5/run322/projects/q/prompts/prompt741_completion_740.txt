  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `deferred.notify` to send a progress update, while the new code would send a rejection instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `deferred.resolve` to send the fulfilled value, while the new code would send a rejected promise instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `deferred.notify` to send a progress update, while the new code would send a notification instead.

DONE.
