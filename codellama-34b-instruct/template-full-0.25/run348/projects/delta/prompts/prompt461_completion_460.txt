  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the current op in the slice, which would cause the `rest` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next op in the slice, which would cause the `rest` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 3))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next two ops in the slice, which would cause the `rest` method to return a different result.

DONE.
