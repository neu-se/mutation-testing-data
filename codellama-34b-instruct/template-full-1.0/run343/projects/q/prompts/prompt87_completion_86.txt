  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would increment the value of `f` by 1, causing the `call` method to be called with a different function reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would decrement the value of `f` by 1, causing the `call` method to be called with a different function reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `f` by 2, causing the `call` method to be called with a different function reference.

DONE.
