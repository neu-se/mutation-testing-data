  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` is a function that checks whether the promise has been rejected, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object containing information about the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `state` is a property of the promise object that contains its current state (such as "fulfilled" or "rejected"), whereas `inspect` returns an object that provides additional information about the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` is a function that checks whether the promise has been fulfilled, whereas `inspect` is a function that returns an object containing information about the promise.

DONE.
