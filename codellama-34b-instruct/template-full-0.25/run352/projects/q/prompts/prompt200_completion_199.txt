  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into individual characters, rather than lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into individual words and return the length of the resulting array, rather than the number of lines in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into individual lines and return the length of the resulting array, rather than the number of lines in the stack trace.

DONE.
