  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `longitude` property of an empty object.

DONE.
