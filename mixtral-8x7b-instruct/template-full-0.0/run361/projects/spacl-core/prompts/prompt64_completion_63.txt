 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.rules.length = this.rules.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of pushing the new rules to the `rules` array, it sets the length of the array to itself plus one, which may not add the rules as expected and could lead to unexpected behavior in the `query`, `matches`, and other methods that rely on the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.rules = this.rules.concat(rules)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method to add the new rules to the `rules` array, which creates a new array and does not modify the original array. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the `query`, `matches`, and other methods that rely on the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
this.rules.push(...rules)
```
This would result in different
