  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next value in the iteration, which is not necessarily the same as `other`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `other` is a different iterator than `thisIter`, and `other.next()` would return a different value than `thisIter.next()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `other.ops[0]` is a different value than `thisIter.next()`, and would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
