  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would include the wrong number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be empty, causing the method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would include the wrong information.

DONE.
