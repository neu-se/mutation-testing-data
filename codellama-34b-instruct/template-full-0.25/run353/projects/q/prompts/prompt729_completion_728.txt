  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `promises` array starting from the second element, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `promises` array with an empty array, effectively creating a copy of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any falsy values from the `promises` array, potentially changing the length and content of the array.

DONE.
