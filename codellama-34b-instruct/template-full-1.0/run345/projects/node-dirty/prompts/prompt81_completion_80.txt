  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', err
```
This would result in different behavior because the event being emitted is different. In the original code, the `error` event is emitted. However, in the replaced code, the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` argument passed to the `emit` method is different. In the original code, an `err` object is passed. However, in the replaced code, `null` is passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the event being emitted is different and the `err` argument passed to the `emit` method is different.

DONE.
