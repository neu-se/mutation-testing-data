  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` is a string and `toLowerCase()` would return a lowercase version of the string, which could result in a different embed type being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of strings and would return the length of the string, which could result in a different number of embeds being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` is a method of strings and would split the string into an array of substrings, which could result in a different number of embeds being used.

DONE.
