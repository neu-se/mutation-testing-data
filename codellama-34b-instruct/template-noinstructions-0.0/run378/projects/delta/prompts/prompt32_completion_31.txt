  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is an object, and `attr` is a string. In the original code, `attr` is used as a key to access the `base` object, but if `base` is used instead, it would return the entire `base` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attr[key]` is a string, and `base` is an object. In the original code, `base` is used as a key to access the `attr` object, but if `attr[key]` is used instead, it would return a string, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
