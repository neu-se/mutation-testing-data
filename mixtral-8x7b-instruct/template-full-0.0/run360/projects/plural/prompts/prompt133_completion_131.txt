 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `result` function of the rule instead of the `match` pattern, potentially causing incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['0']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `match` pattern using a string key instead of the array index, potentially causing issues if the `rules` array is redefined with a different prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.match
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `match` pattern using the dot notation instead of the array index, potentially causing issues if the `rules` array is redefined with a different prototype.

DONE.
