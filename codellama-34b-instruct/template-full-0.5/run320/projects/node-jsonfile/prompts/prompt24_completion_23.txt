  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` takes two arguments, but `options.reviver` is not a function. In the original code, `options.reviver` is a function that is passed to `JSON.parse` as a second argument, but in this modified code, it is not a function and will cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(content, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` takes two arguments, but `options` is an object that contains the `reviver` function, not a function itself. In the original code, `options.reviver` is a function that is passed to `JSON.parse` as a second argument, but in this modified code, it is an object that does not contain a `reviver` function, and will cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.
