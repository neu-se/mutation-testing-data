  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `null` instead of `value`, which could cause potential issues in the code that uses the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with `undefined` instead of `value`, which could cause potential issues in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the number 5 instead of `value`, which could cause potential issues in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
