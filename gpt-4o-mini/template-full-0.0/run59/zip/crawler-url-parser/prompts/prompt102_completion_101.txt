Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.text
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being retrieved from the `urlMap`, potentially leading to incorrect text being associated with the URL instead of the URL itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string "extra" to the URL, causing a mismatch in the key used to retrieve the existing entry in the `urlMap`, which would lead to incorrect behavior when checking for duplicates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace(/http/, 'https')
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the URL by changing the protocol from `http` to `https`, which could lead to a situation where the same resource is treated as different due to the protocol difference, affecting how URLs are stored and compared in the `urlMap`.

DONE.
