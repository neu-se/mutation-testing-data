  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` instead of `Math.sin` will be performed on the `b` variable, which may produce different results in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are summed without any check for multiply defined variables, which may produce different results in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` instead of the `b` variable will be used in the calculation, which may produce different results in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
