  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with unhandledReasons.push(reason). This would result in different behavior because unhandledReasons and unhandledRejections are different variables, and pushing to only one of them would not satisfy the condition for tracking and handling rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(at, 1). This would result in different behavior because the promise would be removed from the list of unhandled rejections but would not be considered handled, potentially causing it to be reported as an unhandled rejection again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1). This would result in different behavior because the reason would be removed from the list of unhandled reasons, but the rejection would still be tracked, potentially causing it to be reported as an unhandled rejection again.

DONE.
