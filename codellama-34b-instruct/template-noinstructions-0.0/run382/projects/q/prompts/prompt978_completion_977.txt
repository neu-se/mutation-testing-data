  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to `nodeArgs` before calling `this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs])`, while the new code fragment pushes it after. This could cause the `nodeArgs` array to be modified after it is passed to `this.dispatch()`, which could have unintended consequences.
