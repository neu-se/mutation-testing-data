  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, basename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `basename` variable contains the file extension, while the `decodedBasename` variable contains the file name without the extension. Using `basename` instead of `decodedBasename` would result in a different output for the `dest` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `pathname` is a string containing the full path and file name, while `dest` is a string containing the file name only. Using `pathname` instead of `dest` would result in a different output for the `dest` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest, url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.pathname` contains the full path and file name, while `dest` is a string containing the file name only. Using `url.pathname` instead of
