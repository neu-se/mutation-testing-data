  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where `err` is `null` or `undefined`, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where `err` is `null` or `undefined`, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not handle the case where `err` is `null` or `undefined`, which could cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results.

DONE.
