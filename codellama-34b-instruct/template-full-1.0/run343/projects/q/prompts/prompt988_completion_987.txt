  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments being passed to the `dispatch` method are incorrect. The method expects an array with the name of the method as the first element, followed by an array of arguments. By passing in `nodeArgs` directly, we are essentially passing an array of arguments twice, which would cause the method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is expecting an array of arguments, but we are only passing in a single argument (the name of the method).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", name, nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is expecting an array of arguments, but we are passing in a single argument (the name of the method) followed by an array of arguments.

DONE.
