 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacteriums'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected plural form of 'bacterium' from 'bacteria' to 'bacteriums'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it always appends 'a' to the input word, instead of returning the expected plural form 'bacteria'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'S' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the input word to uppercase and appends 'S', instead of returning the expected plural form 'bacteria'.

DONE.
