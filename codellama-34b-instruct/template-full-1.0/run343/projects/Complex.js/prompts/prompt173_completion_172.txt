  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` parameter is not a property of the `Complex` object, so accessing it using `[]` notation would result in a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0 && z['re'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the imaginary part of `z` is zero, while the original code fragment checked if both the imaginary and real parts of `z` are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0 || z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the imaginary part of `z` is non-zero, while the original code fragment checked if both the imaginary and real parts of `z` are non-zero.

DONE.
