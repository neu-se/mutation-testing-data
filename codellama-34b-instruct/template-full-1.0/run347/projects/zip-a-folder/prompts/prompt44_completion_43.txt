  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` expects a file path or a stream, whereas `zipArchive.directory` expects a directory path or a glob pattern. If `zipArchive.file` is used in place of `zipArchive.directory`, the function would likely throw an error or create an invalid archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument passed to `zipArchive.directory` would cause the function to include the directory itself in the archive, whereas the original code did not include the directory. This could result in a different archive structure and potentially cause issues with extraction or other operations that rely on the expected archive structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.bulk
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.bulk` expects an array of
