  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called instead of `getCountry`, which would return a different set of timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getAllCountries
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getAllCountries` function is called instead of `getCountry`, which would return a different set of countries.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getAllTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getAllTimezones` function is called instead of `getCountry`, which would return a different set of timezones.

DONE.
