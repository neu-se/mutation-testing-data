  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the first progress listener, whereas the original code calls all progress listeners.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all progress listeners except the first one, whereas the original code calls all progress listeners.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all progress listeners except the last one, whereas the original code calls all progress listeners.

DONE.
