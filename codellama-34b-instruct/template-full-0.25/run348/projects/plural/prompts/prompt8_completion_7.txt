  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[result, match]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` and `result` variables are swapped, which could cause the `addRule` function to add the wrong rule to the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is incremented by 1, which could cause the `addRule` function to add the wrong rule to the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[match, result - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is decremented by 1, which could cause the `addRule` function to add the wrong rule to the `rules` array.

DONE.
