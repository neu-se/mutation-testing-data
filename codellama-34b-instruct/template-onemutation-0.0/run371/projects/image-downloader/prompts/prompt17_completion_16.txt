  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `decodeURIComponent` function to decode the basename, while the new code fragment uses the `toLowerCase` method to convert the basename to lowercase. This could cause the test to pass even if the `decodeURIComponent` function is not working correctly.

DONE.
