  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to contain duplicate entries for each policy, with the same name and value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to contain entries with uppercase names, which would not match the original names used in the `Policy` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to contain entries with reversed names, which would not match the original names used in the `Policy` objects.

DONE.
