  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `retain` operation to retain one more character than it should, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `retain` operation to retain one fewer character than it should, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next()) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `retain` operation to retain twice as many characters as it should, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
