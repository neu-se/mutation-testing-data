  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns "object" for null, which would cause the `_progressed` function to be called instead of `_rejected`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and therefore would not have a `valueOf()` method, which would cause the `_fulfilled` function to be called instead of `_rejected`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is not an object, and therefore would not have a `valueOf()` method, which would cause the `_fulfilled` function to be called instead of `_rejected`.

DONE.
