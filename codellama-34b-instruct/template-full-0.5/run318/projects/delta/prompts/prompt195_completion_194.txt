  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isEqual` function, causing the `if` statement to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNotEqual` is not a real function, and the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEquivalent
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEquivalent` is not a real function, and the code would throw an error.

DONE.
