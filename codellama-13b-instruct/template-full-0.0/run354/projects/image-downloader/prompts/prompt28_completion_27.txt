  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight()` method is called instead of `trimLeft()`, which would cause the URL to be trimmed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith()` method is called with a hardcoded string instead of the `url` variable, which would cause the code to always check if the URL starts with "https" regardless of the actual URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.endsWith('.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `endsWith()` method is called with a hardcoded string instead of the `url` variable, which would cause the code to always check if the URL ends with ".com" regardless of the actual URL.

DONE.
