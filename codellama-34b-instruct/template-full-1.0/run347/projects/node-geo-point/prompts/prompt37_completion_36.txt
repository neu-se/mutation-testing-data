  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, while `point2Rad` returns the radian value of a given point's latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad - point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad - point2Rad` would calculate the difference between the radian values of the two points' latitudes, which could result in a different bearing calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atan2(point2.longitude - point1.longitude, point2.latitude - point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `atan2()` computes the arctangent of the ratio of its arguments, which could result in a different bearing calculation.

DONE.
