  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalise` function is not called, and the `regex` property of the `Matcher` class would not be set correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not called, and the `regex` property of the `Matcher` class would not be set correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\*/g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec` string is not being matched against the correct regular expression, and the `regex` property of the `Matcher` class would not be set correctly.

DONE.
