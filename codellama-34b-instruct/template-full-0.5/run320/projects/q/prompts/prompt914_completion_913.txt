  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive an empty array instead of the actual arguments, which would likely cause the function to fail or return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to receive `null` instead of the actual arguments, which would likely cause the function to fail or return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function
