  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This means that the replaced code would check if the URL starts with a different set of characters than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if a string contains a certain substring, while `startsWith()` checks if a string starts with a certain substring. This means that the replaced code would check for a different condition than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.indexOf('https') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, while `startsWith()` checks if a string starts with a certain substring. This means that the replaced code would check for a different condition than the original code
