  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called twice, which would cause the promise to be rejected twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with a function that rejects the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the original promise was resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method would be called with a function that rejects the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the original promise was resolved.

DONE.
