  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `next()` function with no arguments, while this replacement uses `next()` with a `null` argument. This could potentially cause the `next()` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `next()` function with no arguments, while this replacement uses `next()` with an `undefined` argument. This could potentially cause the `next()` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `next()` function with no arguments, while this replacement uses `next()` with a `true` argument. This could potentially cause the `next()` function to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
