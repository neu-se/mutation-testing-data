  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.delete` and `otherOp.delete` are different variables, and could lead to incorrect results in the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.retain` are different variables, and could lead to incorrect results in the comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain, otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` and `otherOp.delete` are different variables, and could lead to incorrect results in the comparison.

DONE.
