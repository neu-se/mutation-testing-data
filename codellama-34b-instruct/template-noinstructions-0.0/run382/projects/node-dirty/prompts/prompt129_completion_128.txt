  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is used to pause the stream, but passing `false` as an argument would cause the stream to be unpaused, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is used to pause the stream, but passing `true` as an argument would cause the stream to be paused, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is used to pause the stream, but passing `null` as an argument would cause the stream to be paused, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

DONE.
