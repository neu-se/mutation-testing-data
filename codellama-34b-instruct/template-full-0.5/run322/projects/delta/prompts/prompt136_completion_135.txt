  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method is not defined for the `otherIter` object, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
