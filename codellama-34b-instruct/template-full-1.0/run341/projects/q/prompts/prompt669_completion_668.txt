  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different function than `apply`, and it takes a `this` argument instead of an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and arguments, while `apply` calls a function with the arguments in an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"concat"
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays, while `apply` calls a function with an array of arguments.

DONE.
