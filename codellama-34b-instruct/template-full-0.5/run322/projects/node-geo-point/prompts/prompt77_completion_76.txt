  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 180 degrees, which could have a significant impact on the resulting destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be doubled, which could cause the destination point to be off by a significant amount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 90
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 90 degrees, which could cause the destination point to be off by a significant amount.

DONE.
