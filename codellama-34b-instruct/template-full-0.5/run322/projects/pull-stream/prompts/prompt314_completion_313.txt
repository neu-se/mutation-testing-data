  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the current value of the `data` variable, while the new code fragment `null` returns a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the current value of the `data` variable, while the new code fragment `undefined` returns an undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` returns the current value of the `data` variable, while the new code fragment `NaN` returns a NaN (Not a Number) value.

DONE.
