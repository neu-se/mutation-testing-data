  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different subset of the `other.ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different subset of the `other.ops` array, starting from the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a different subset of the `other.ops` array, starting from the beginning and including only the first element.

DONE.
