  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a `length` property that is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a `length` property that is less than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a `length` property that is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a `length` property that is greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length !== 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a `length` property that is equal to 1, while this new code fragment checks if the `arguments` object has a `length` property that is not
