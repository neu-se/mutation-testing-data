  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function would be called with the first element of the `nodeArgs` array as the argument, whereas the original code calls it with the entire `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function would be called with the length of the `nodeArgs` array as the argument, whereas the original code calls it with the entire `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function would be called with `null` as the argument, whereas the original code calls it with the entire `nodeArgs` array.

DONE.
