  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` and `any` are different methods in the `Q` library, and they have different behavior when dealing with arrays of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is not a method in the `Q` library, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is a method in the `Q` library, but it has a different behavior than `any` when dealing with arrays of promises.

DONE.
