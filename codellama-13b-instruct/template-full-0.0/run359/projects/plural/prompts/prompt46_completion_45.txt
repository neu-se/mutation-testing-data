  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a vowel followed by "o", while the new code fragment matches words that end with a vowel followed by "o" regardless of the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-insensitive, while the new code fragment is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a vowel followed by "o" regardless of the case, while the new code fragment matches words that end with a vowel followed by "o" regardless of the case and ignores the case of the "o".

DONE.
