  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse|s'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `mouse|s` would match the string "mouse" or "s", whereas the original code fragment `'mouse'` would only match the string "mouse".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "mice" would match the rule for words that maintain Latin/Greek plurals, whereas the original code fragment `'mouse'` would not match any rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dog'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "dog" would match the rule for words that end in -s, whereas the original code fragment `'mouse'` would not match any rules.

DONE.
