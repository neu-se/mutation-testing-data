  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `query` property of the returned URL object to be `null`, which would in turn cause the `search` property to be `null` as well. This would affect the behavior of the `ret.search` and `ret.querycount` assignments later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `fragment` property of the returned URL object to be `null`, which would affect the behavior of the `ret.url` and `ret.baseurl` assignments later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `query`
