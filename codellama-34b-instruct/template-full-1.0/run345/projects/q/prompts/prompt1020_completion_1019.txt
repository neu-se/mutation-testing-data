  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a method that returns a property value, while "post" is a method that sends a request to a server.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a method that updates a property value, while "post" is a method that sends a request to a server.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is a method that sends a request to a server, but it does not require a callback function to be passed as an argument, which is required by "post".

DONE.
