  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match` would return a `Matcher` object, which is not a boolean value, and would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex.source)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match` would return a `Matcher` object, which is not a boolean value, and would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex.source, this.regex.flags)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.match` would return a `Matcher` object, which is not a boolean value, and would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
