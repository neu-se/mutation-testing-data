  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect("finally")
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then` would now receive the string "finally" as its first argument, rather than the promise state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then` would now receive the string "error" as its first argument, rather than the promise state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect("done")
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `then` would now receive the string "done" as its first argument, rather than the promise state.

DONE.
