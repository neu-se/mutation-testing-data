  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing the `reason` object, which may contain additional information about the error, while the new code fragment is passing a string with the value "error".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing the `reason` object, which may contain additional information about the error, while the new code fragment is passing a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was passing the `reason` object, which may contain additional information about the error, while the new code fragment is passing an undefined value.

DONE.
