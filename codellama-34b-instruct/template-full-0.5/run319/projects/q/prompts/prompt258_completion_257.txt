  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(value)`, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value returned by the `then` method's callback function, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).catch(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(value)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the value returned by the `catch` method's callback function, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return value; }).catch(function() { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `Q(value)`, which would cause the
