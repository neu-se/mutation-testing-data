  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const tzMap = getTimezonesMap(data)[id] || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function is not returning the expected value, causing the `tzMap` variable to be initialized with an empty object instead of the expected object with timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const tzMap = getTimezonesMap(data)[id] || { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function is not returning the expected value, causing the `tzMap` variable to be initialized with an object that has a different structure than the expected object with timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const tzMap = getTimezonesMap(data)[id] || { current: [], all: [] };
