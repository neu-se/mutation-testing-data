  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would no longer execute the `resolve` function and instead return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would no longer execute the `resolve` function and instead return a promise with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would no longer execute the `resolve` function and instead return a rejected promise.

DONE.
