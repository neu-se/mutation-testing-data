 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `point2Rad` variable with the number 1, causing the `cos` function to only consider the x-coordinate of the point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, causing the distance calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the cosine of 0, which is 1, regardless of the input. This would cause the distance calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
