  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with a different value for the `size` parameter, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with a negative value for the `size` parameter, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with a null value for the `size` parameter, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
