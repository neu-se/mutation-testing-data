  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are three possible code fragments that can be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the code snippet provided, along with a brief explanation of the different behavior they would result in:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd();
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd()` is a function that is only invoked when `end` is true, whereas the original code fragment `onEnd` is simply a reference to the `onEnd` function. By changing the code to `onEnd()`, we are invoking the function immediately when `end` is true, rather than just referring to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd.call(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `onEnd.call(null)` is a different way of invoking the `onEnd` function, passing `null` as the `this` context. This can be useful if we want to ensure that `onEnd` is always called with a specific context, regardless of how it is invoked.
