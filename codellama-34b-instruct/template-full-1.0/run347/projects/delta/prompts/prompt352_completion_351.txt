  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes * baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication would change the attributes of the operation, potentially resulting in different line breaks or formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes + baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition would result in a different set of attributes than the original code, potentially leading to unexpected differences in the rendering of the document.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes - baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction would result in a different set of attributes than the original code, potentially leading to unexpected differences in the rendering of the document.

DONE.
