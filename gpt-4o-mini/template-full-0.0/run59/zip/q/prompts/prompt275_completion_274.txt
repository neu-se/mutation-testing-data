Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, potentially leading to a fulfilled promise when an error occurred.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.reject("An error occurred");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with a static error message, rather than passing the actual error that occurred, which could lead to loss of context about the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.notify(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify method instead of reject, which is intended for progress updates, not for handling errors, thus not properly signaling that the promise has been rejected.

DONE.
