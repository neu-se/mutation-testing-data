  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: false,
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is set to `false`, which would result in the archive not being compressed, even if the `compression` level is set to a non-zero value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: true,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` option is set to `true`,
