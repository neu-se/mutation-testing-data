  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replacer` function is not being used in the original code, but by adding it, we are changing the behavior of the `JSON.parse()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.space
```
This would result in different behavior because the `space` option is not being used in the original code, but by adding it, we are changing the behavior of the `JSON.stringify()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content, options.reviver, options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is not being used in the original code, but by adding it, we are changing the behavior of the `fs.readFileSync()` method.

DONE.
