  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns a different substring than `slice`. For example, `part.substring(1)` would return the substring starting from the second character, whereas `part.slice(1)` would return the substring starting from the first character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.charAt
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt` returns the character at a specific index, whereas `slice` returns a substring. For example, `part.charAt(1)` would return the character at the second index, whereas `part.slice(1)` would return the substring starting from the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, whereas `slice` returns a substring. For example, `part.split(' ')` would return an array of substrings split by spaces, whereas `part.slice
