Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter is omitted, which may lead to unexpected results if the `writeFile` function relies on specific options for encoding or other configurations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, { encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the encoding to 'utf8', potentially ignoring any encoding specified in the `options` parameter, which could lead to data corruption if the original data requires a different encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, obj, null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the options parameter may cause the `writeFile` function to not apply any options, which could lead to default behavior that is not intended, such as using default encoding or file permissions.

DONE.
