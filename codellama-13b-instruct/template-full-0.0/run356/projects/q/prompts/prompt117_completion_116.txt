  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to invoke the function with a different context, which can affect the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to invoke the function with a different context and arguments, which can affect the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function with a different context, which can affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
