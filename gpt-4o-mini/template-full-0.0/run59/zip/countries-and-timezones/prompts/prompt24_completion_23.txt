Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `dstOffset` value instead of the `utcOffset`, which may lead to incorrect time zone offset calculations if daylight saving time is not considered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + 60
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 60 minutes to the `utcOffset`, effectively shifting the time zone offset by one hour, which could lead to incorrect time zone representations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `utcOffset` with `null`, causing the offset string to be generated incorrectly and potentially leading to runtime errors or unexpected output.

DONE.
