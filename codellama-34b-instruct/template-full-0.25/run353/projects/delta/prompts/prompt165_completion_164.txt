  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the types of operations in the other iterator instead of the current iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the lengths of operations in the current iterator instead of the types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the lengths of operations in the other iterator instead of the types.

DONE.
