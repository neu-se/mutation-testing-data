  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an additional argument to the `resetUnhandledRejections` function, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resetUnhandledRejections()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `resetUnhandledRejections` function immediately, rather than in a promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly modify the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than calling the `resetUnhandledRejections` function.

Please consider that these are just examples and there are many other options to replace the PLACEHOLDER with a different code fragment. DONE.
