  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that is not defined in the scope of the function, and would therefore cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.deferred` is a property of the object, and would therefore be undefined in the scope of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.deferred` is a method of the `Q` object, and would therefore return a new deferred object, which would not be the same as the original deferred object that was passed to the function.

DONE.
