  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```toTile(coordinate, zoom + 1)```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the zoom level by 1, which would result in a different tile being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```toTile(coordinate, zoom - 1)```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the zoom level by 1, which would result in a different tile being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```toTile(coordinate, 10 - zoom)```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the zoom level to 10 - the current zoom level, which would result in a different tile being returned.

DONE.
