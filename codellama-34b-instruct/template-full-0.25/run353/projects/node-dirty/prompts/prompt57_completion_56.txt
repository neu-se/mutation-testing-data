  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called twice, which could cause the file streams to be closed prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted twice, which could cause the event listener to be called twice, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.emit('close')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted twice, which could cause the event listener to be called twice, leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
