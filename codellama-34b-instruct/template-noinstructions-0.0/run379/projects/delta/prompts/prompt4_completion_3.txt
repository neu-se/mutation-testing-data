  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to always return the first argument, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to always return the second argument, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `compose` function to always return `null`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
