  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first element of the `ops` array, which may be important for the correctness of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the last element of the `ops` array, which may be important for the correctness of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit both the first and last elements of the `ops` array, which may be important for the correctness of the program.

DONE.
