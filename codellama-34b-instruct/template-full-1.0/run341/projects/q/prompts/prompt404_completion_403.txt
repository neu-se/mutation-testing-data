  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` statement would cause the function to return early, instead of waiting for the `then` callbacks to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown, instead of returning the `reason` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log` statement would log the `reason` value to the console, instead of returning it.

DONE.
