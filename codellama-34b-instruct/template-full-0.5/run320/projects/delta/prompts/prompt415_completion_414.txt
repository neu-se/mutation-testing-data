  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the length of the next operation, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextLength` returns the length of the current operation, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.nextType
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextType` returns the type of the current operation, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation.

DONE.
