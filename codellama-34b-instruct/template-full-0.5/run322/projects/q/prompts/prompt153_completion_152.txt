  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stacks with an empty string, which would change the resulting string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join(", ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stacks with a comma and a space, which would change the resulting string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the stacks with a space, which would change the resulting string.

DONE.
