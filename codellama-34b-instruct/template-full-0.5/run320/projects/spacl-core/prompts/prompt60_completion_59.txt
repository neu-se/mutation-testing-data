  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `finalise` function immediately, rather than returning a reference to it as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `finalise` function with `this` set to the current object, rather than returning a reference to it as the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
finalise.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that, when called, would call the `finalise` function with `this` set to the current object, rather than returning a reference to it as the original code does.

DONE.
