  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the real part of the complex number plus 1 instead of just the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sine of the real part of the complex number using the `Math.sin()` function instead of using the `sin()` function from the `Complex` class.

DONE.
