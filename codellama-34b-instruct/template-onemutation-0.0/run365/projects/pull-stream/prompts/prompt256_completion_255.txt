  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read` unconditionally, whereas the original code fragment only assigns it if `stream` is a function. This could cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with an invalid `stream` value, leading to unexpected behavior.
