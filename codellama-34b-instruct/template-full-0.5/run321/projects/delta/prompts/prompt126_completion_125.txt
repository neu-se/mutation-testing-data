  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be included in the loop even if it is equal to `start`, which would cause the loop to iterate one more time than it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < start + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be excluded from the loop if it is equal to `start`, which would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than it should.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < start + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `index` would be excluded from the loop if it is equal to `start` or `start + 1`, which would cause the loop to iterate two fewer times than it should.

DONE.
