  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, but this new code fragment calls it with two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only increments `i` if `cb` is not null, but this new code fragment increments `i` regardless of whether `cb` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` before calling `cb`, but this new code fragment calls `cb` with the current value of `i` without incrementing it.

DONE.
