  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "memo" to the list of rules, while this code fragment adds the same word as both the singular and plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "memo" to the list of rules, while this code fragment adds a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memories')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "memo" to the list of rules, while this code fragment adds a completely different plural form.

DONE.
