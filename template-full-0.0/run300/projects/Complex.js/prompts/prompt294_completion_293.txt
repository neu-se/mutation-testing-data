  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the scope of the `tan` function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the calculation of the `d` variable, and changing its value would affect the result of the `tan` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is used in the calculation of the `d` variable, and changing its value would affect the result of the `tan` function.

DONE.
