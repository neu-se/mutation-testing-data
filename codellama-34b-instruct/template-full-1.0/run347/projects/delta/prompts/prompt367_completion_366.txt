  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    if (thisIter.peek() === 'â„œ') {
```
This would result in different behavior because we are checking if the peeked element is a real number, rather than a string as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
    const opLen = iter.peekLength();
    if (opLen % 2 === 0) {
```
By checking if the length of the next operation is even, then the behavior of the function will be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
    if (thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert') {
```
By checking if the peeked element is not an insert operation, then the behavior of the function will be different.

DONE.
