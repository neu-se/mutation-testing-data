  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the text content of the current element, while this replacement code fragment is accessing the value of the "href" attribute of the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the value of the "href" attribute of the current element, while this replacement code fragment is accessing the text content of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split('~')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was accessing the entire value of the "href" attribute of the current element, while this replacement code fragment is accessing the first part of the value of the "href" attribute, separated by the "~" character.

DONE.
