  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, while the `re` property is the real part. Using `z['im']` instead of `z['re']` would cause the function to return a different result, which could be a bug or a feature depending on the context in which the function is used.
