  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, deferred.reject, deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method is replaced with `deferred.reject`, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because all three methods (`deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.notify`) are replaced with `deferred.notify`, causing the promise to be notified three times instead of resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve, deferred.resolve, deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because all three methods (`deferred.resolve`, `deferred.reject`, and `deferred.notify`) are replaced with `deferred.resolve`, causing the promise to be resolved three times instead of
