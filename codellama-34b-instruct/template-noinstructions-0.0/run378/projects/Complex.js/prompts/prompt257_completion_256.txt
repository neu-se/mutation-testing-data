  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects the second argument to be the angle in radians, and adding 1 to the angle would shift the result by 1 radian.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects the second argument to be the angle in radians, and subtracting 1 from the angle would shift the result by -1 radian.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects the second argument to be the angle in radians, and multiplying the angle by 2 would double the result.

DONE.
