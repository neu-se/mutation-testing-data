  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the value of the `read` variable, while the replacement code is using the value `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the value of `read`, while the replacement code is using the value of `read` incremented by `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the value of `read`, while the replacement code is using the value of `read` multiplied by `2`.

DONE.
