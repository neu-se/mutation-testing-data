  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not a method of the `dispatch` method, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch('post', [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is not a method of the `Q` object, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch('post', [name, nodeArgs]).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this` object is not the same as the `Q` object, and it would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
