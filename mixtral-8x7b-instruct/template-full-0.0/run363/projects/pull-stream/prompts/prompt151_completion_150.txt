 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code stores the value in a temporary variable `_value` before passing it to the callback, while the mutated code directly passes the current value, which might change in the meantime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `abort` is truthy and returns early if it is, while the mutated code always calls `abortCb` regardless of the value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
abortCb(cb, abort, value)
