  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive a null value as the first argument, which would cause it to return early without reading any data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive an undefined value as the first argument, which would cause it to return early without reading any data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would receive a false value as the first argument, which would cause it to return early without reading any data.

DONE.
