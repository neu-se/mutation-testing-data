  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `result` object, while the buggy code fragment returns the value of the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, errback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of the `result` object, while the buggy code fragment returns the value of the `errback` function.
