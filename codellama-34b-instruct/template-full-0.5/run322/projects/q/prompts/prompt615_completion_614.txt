  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.undefinedProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access an undefined property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string representation of the object, which may not be what the function is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an iterator for the object, which may not be what the function is expecting.

DONE.
