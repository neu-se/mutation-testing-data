  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different portion of the `base` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different portion of the `base` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, otherIndex
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would return a different portion of the `other` Delta.

DONE.
