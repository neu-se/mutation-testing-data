 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` might return a string representation of the object that is different from the `url` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl['url']
```
This would result in different behavior because using bracket notation to access the `url` property allows for dynamic property names, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the property name is changed or if it doesn't exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl.__proto__.url
```
This would result in different behavior because accessing the `url` property through the prototype chain could lead to unexpected behavior if the prototype chain is modified or if the `url` property is shadowed by a property with the same name in a subclass.

DONE.
