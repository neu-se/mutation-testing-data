  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because "all" is a method of the Promise.all method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.

Replacing "all" with "any" would result in the promise returning immediately with the value of the first resolved promise, without waiting for any of the remaining promises to resolve.
