  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `ended` argument, while this code fragment calls it with both `null` and `data`. This could cause the test to pass when it should fail, or vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `ended` argument, while this code fragment calls it with the `ended` argument and the `data` argument. This could cause the test to pass when it should fail, or vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the `ended` argument, while this code fragment calls it with the `ended` argument, the `data` argument, and a third argument. This could cause
