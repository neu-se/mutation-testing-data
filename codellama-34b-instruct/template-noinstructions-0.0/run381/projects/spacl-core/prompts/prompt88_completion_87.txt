  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the function is `policy => [policy.name, policy]`, which returns an array with the policy name and the policy object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy.name])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the function is `policy => [policy.name, policy.name]`, which returns an array with the policy name and the policy name again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.map(policy => [policy.name, policy.name.toUpperCase()])
```
