  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not reject the promise if the callback is undefined, but this modified code fragment would reject the promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise if the callback is undefined, but this modified code fragment would resolve the promise with the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(callback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would reject the promise if the callback is undefined, but this modified code fragment would notify the promise with the callback function.

DONE.
