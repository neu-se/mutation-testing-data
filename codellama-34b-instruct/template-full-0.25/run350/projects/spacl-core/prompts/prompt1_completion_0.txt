  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the `if` statement to be entered even if the regex match fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === undefined

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value is used instead of `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to be
