  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[Math.random()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose a property of the object, which may not exist or have the desired value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[object.length]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference a property that does not exist on the object, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object["" + Math.random()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new property on the object with a random name, which may not be intended.

DONE.
