  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a + b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square of `a` and `b`, rather than the square root of their sum, which would produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b * b + a * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the square root of the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than the square of `a` and `b`, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(Math.log(a * a + b * b) / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the natural logarithm of the sum of `a` and `b`, and then raise `e` to that power, which would produce a different result.

DONE.
