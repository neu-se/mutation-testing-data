  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[4]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `ref[3]`, which is the fourth element of the `ref` array, while the new code fragment uses `ref[4]`, which is the fifth element of the `ref` array. This change would cause the function to use a different value for the fourth argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
