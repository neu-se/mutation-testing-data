Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'wrong_destination.txt'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file will always be written to a hardcoded filename 'wrong_destination.txt', regardless of the intended destination provided in the `dest` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the destination will cause the `createWriteStream` function to throw an error, as it expects a valid file path, leading to an unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + '.bak'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file will be written to a location with a '.bak' extension appended to the original destination, which may not be the intended behavior and could lead to confusion or data loss.

DONE.
