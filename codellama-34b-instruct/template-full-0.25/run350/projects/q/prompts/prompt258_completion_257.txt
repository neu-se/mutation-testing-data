  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function () { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve to a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different state for the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function () { return; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve to `undefined`, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different state for the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function () { throw new Error(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject with an error, which would cause the `become` function to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to a different state for the promise.
