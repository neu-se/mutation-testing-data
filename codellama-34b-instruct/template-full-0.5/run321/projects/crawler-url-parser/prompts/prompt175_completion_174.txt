  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` is a function that parses a string and returns an integer, while `parse` is a function that parses a string and returns an object with the URL components.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because `String` is a constructor function that creates a new string object, while `parse` is a function that parses a string and returns an object with the URL components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL` is a constructor function that creates a new URL object, while `parse` is a function that parses a string and returns an object with the URL components.

DONE.
