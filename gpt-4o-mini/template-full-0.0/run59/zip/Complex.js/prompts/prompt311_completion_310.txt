Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the sine function instead of the cosine function, leading to incorrect calculations for the secant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the tangent function instead of the cosine function, which would produce incorrect results for the secant calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply a transformation to the input of the cosine function, effectively shifting the angle by 1 radian, which would yield incorrect results for the secant.

DONE.
