 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
line.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property, not a method, so there's no need to use parentheses to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
line.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison is now checking if the length is greater than 1 instead of greater than 0, which would mean that the predicate function would not be called for lines with a single character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
line.length === 0
