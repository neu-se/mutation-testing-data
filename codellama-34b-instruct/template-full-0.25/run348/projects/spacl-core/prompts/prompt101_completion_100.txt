  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, which could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting from the specified index (in this case, 1). This could potentially cause the `query()` method to return a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
