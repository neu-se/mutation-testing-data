 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name === null || name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for the `undefined` value instead of using the `void 0` expression. This change might affect how the code handles cases where the `name` variable has been declared but not assigned a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name.toString() === "" || name === void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `name` variable is an empty string (`""`) instead of checking if it is `null` or `undefined`. This change might affect how the code handles cases where the `name` variable is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
name === null || typeof name === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `typeof` operator to check if the `name` variable is `undefined`. This change might affect how the code handles cases where the `
