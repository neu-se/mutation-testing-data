  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilliz'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns "chillies" for the plural form of "chilli", while this code fragment returns "chilliz".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns "chillies" for the plural form of "chilli", while this code fragment returns "chilli".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns "chillies" for the plural form of "chilli", while this code fragment returns "chillis".

DONE.
