  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `callback` to handle the resolution of the promise, whereas replacing it with `reject` would result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `callback` to handle the resolution of the promise, whereas replacing it with `resolve` would result in the promise being resolved immediately without waiting for the promise returned by `result.value` to be fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `callback` to handle the resolution of the promise, whereas replacing it with `continuer.bind(continuer, "next")` would result in the promise being resolved with a different value.

DONE.
