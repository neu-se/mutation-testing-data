  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute()` function returns `true` if the given path is absolute, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, the `!path.isAbsolute()` function is used to check if the `options.dest` path is not absolute, but in the mutated code, the `path.isAbsolute()` function is used to check if the `options.dest` path is absolute. This would result in different behavior because the mutated code would reject the request if the `options.dest` path is absolute, whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest) === '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` function returns the extension of the given path, and in this case, it is checking if the extension of the `options.dest` path is `.jpg`. In the original code, the `path
