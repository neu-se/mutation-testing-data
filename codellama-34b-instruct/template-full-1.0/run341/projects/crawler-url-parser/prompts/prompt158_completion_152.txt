  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[a-zA-Z])[\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a negated character class, which matches any character that is not listed inside the square brackets. However, the modified code fragment uses the character class `[a-zA-Z]`, which only matches alphabetical characters, so it would not match URLs with non-alphabetic characters in the last path segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]+)[\/]?$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the negated character class `[^\/]`, which matches any character that is not a forward slash (`/`). However, the modified code fragment uses the character class `[^\/]+`, which matches one or more non-forward slash characters, so it would not match URLs that have a forward slash as the last character in the last path segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
