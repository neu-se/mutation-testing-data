  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `verbs` object, whereas `this.verbs` returns the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of `this.verbs` with the elements of another array, whereas `this.verbs` returns the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.verbs.filter()` creates a new array by filtering the elements of `this.verbs` based on a predicate function, whereas `this.verbs` returns the original object.

DONE.
