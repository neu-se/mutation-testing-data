  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.nodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `Q(object)` is a promise, and `nodeify` is a method of the `Q` object that takes a promise and a callback as arguments. However, in this option, `object` is not a promise, and `nodeify` is a method of `object` that takes only a callback as an argument. This would result in a `TypeError` because `object` does not have a `nodeify` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q({then: Q.resolve(object)}).nodeify
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `Q(object)` is a promise that resolves to `object` when the promise is fulfilled. However, in this option, `Q({then: Q.resolve(object)})` is a promise that resolves to an object with a `then` property that is a function that resolves to `object`. This would result in a different object
