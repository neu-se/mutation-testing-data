  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `deprecated` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `deliverTimezones` function, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.allTimezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `allTimezones` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `deliverTimezones` function, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones, options.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `timezones` property of the `options` object as the second argument to the `deliverTimezones` function, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
