  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/tickle./)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the constructor to throw an error if the `spec` argument contains the string "tickle", even if it is not a valid specification for the `Matcher` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/(?m)^(?:tickle)+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the constructor to throw an error if the `spec` argument does not start with "tickle" and end with a dollar sign, even if it is not a valid specification for the `Matcher` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the constructor to throw an error if the `spec` argument does not match the regex pattern "[a-zA-Z0-9
