  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only uncorks the write stream when the queue is empty and there are no in-flight writes, but this replacement code fragment uncorks the write stream unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only corks the write stream when the queue is not empty or there are in-flight writes, but this replacement code fragment corks the write stream unconditionally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only ends the write stream when the queue is empty and there are no in-flight writes, but this replacement code fragment ends the write stream unconditionally.

DONE.
