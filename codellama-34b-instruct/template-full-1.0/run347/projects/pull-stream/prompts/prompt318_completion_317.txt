  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
