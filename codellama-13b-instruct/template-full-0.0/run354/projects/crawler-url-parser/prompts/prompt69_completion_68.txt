  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sourceUrl` variable is converted to lowercase, which could affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sourceUrl` variable is converted to uppercase, which could affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sourceUrl` variable is modified to remove the "http" or "https" protocol, which could affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

DONE.
