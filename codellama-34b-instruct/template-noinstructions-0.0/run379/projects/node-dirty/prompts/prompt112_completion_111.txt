  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises an error with the entire buffer, while this code raises an error with the buffer minus the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises an error with the entire buffer, while this code raises an error with the buffer minus the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.replace(/\n/g, '')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code raises an error with the entire buffer, while this code raises an error with the buffer with all newline characters removed
