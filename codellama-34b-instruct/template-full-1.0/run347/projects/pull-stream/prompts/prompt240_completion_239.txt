  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of the expected `end` value.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `end - 1` instead of the expected `end` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- end
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the negative of `end` instead of the expected `end` value.

DONE.
