 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Delta` object's `push` method would not handle `null` values in the same way as an `Op` object, causing unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Delta` object's `push` method expects an `Op` object, and an empty object `{}` does not have the necessary properties, causing unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consume an additional operation from the `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect composition of operations in the `compose` method.

DONE.
