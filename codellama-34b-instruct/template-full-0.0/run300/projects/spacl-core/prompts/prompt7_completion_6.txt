  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path does not contain consecutive slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path contains any slashes at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null && spec.match(/\/\//).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes, while the new code fragment checks if the path contains consecutive slashes and also checks if the length of the match is greater than 0.

DONE.
