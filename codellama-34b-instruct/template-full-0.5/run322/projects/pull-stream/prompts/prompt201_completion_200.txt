  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the callback function `cb` with the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` calls the callback function `abortCb` with the `aborted` error. If `abortCb` is not defined, this would result in a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls the callback function `cb` with the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `null` does not call any callback function. This would cause the code to hang indefinitely if the `read` function is not called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` calls
