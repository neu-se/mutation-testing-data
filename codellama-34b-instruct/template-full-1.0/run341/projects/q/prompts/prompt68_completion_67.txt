  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    array_indexOf(this, basis);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_indexOf` would return the index of the first element in the array that is strictly equal to `basis`, while `basis` is assigned the value of `this[i]` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    array_map(Math.max, this);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` would apply the `Math.max` function to each element in the array, while `basis` is assigned the maximum value of the array in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    array_reduce(this, function (a, b) { return a + b; }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` would accumulate the sum of the elements in the array, while `basis` is assigned the maximum value of the array in the original code
