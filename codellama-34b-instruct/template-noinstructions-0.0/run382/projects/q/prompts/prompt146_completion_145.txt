  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__minimumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the replacement code fragment is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the replacement code fragment is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string, while the replacement code fragment is a number.

DONE.
