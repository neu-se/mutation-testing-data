  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `args` array, which is the `callback` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array with itself, effectively doubling its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the order of the elements in the `args` array.

DONE.
