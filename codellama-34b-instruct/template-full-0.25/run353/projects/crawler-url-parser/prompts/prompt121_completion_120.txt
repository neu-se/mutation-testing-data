  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.of
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.of` creates a new array with a variable number of arguments, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Set.from
```
This would result in different behavior because `Set.from` creates a new set from an existing iterable object, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Map.from
```
This would result in different behavior because `Map.from` creates a new map from an existing iterable object, whereas `Array.from` creates a new array from an existing array-like object.

DONE.
