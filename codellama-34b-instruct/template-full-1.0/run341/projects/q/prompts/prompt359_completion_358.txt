  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<value>"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the actual value, the string literal `"<value>"` would be passed, which could lead to different behavior in the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the actual value, `null` would be passed, which could lead to different behavior in the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing the actual value, `undefined` would be passed, which could lead to different behavior in the `then` method.

DONE.
