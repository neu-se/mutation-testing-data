  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function takes two arguments, but `baseUrlStr` is only one argument, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function takes two arguments, but `true` is not a valid second argument, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(baseUrlStr, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function takes two arguments, but `{}` is not a valid second argument, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
