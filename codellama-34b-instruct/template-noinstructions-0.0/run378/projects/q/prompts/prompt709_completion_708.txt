  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not an empty array, but the replacement code would cause the function to always receive an empty array as its arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not null, but the replacement code would cause the function to always receive null as its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object is not undefined, but the replacement code would cause the function to always receive undefined as its arguments.

DONE.
