  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)` would return a new node resolver that is not the same as the original one, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```go
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would return a new node resolver that is not the same as the original one, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(Q.async());
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.async()` returns a new asynchronous function that is not the same as the original one, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value or error.

DONE.
