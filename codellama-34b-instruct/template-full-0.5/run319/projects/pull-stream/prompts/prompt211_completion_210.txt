  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `aborted` is truthy, while the new code fragment is checking if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `aborted` is truthy, while the new code fragment is checking if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `aborted` is truthy, while the new code fragment is checking if it is falsy.

DONE.
