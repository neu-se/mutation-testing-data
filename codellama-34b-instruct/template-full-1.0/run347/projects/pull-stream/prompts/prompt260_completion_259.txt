  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the error object to `nextStream` if `err` is `true`, but this modified code passes the error object to `nextStream` regardless of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes the error object to `nextStream` if `err` is `true`, but this modified code omits passing the error object to `nextStream`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === false) nextStream(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only passes the error object to `nextStream` if `err` is `true`, but this modified code passes the error object to `nextStream` if `err` is `false`.

DONE.
