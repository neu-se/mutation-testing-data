  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this replacement code fragment uses the `startsWith()` method to check if the URL starts with the string "http".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf('http') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this replacement code fragment uses the `indexOf()` method to check if the URL starts with the string "http".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.match(/^\.*\/|^(?!localhost)\w+:/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this replacement code fragment uses the `match()` method to check if the URL matches the regular expression.
