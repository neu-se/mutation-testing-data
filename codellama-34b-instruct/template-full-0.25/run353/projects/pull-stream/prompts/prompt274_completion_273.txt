  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new function that only executes the given function once. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead of a new function, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new function that only executes the given function once. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a new function, which would likely cause errors in the code that uses this function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new function that only executes the given function once. Replacing it with an empty function would cause the function to return a
