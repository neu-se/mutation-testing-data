  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is an empty string.

DONE.
