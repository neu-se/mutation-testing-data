Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/([^\S\r\n]+)/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split on whitespace characters (excluding newline), but would not consider other special characters like parentheses, brackets, or quotes as token boundaries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\r\n/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only split on newline characters, effectively treating all other whitespace and special characters as part of the tokens.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split on word boundaries, which could lead to incorrect tokenization, especially for words that are followed by punctuation or other special characters.

DONE.
