 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would not be called on the promise, and the `state` property would not be checked. Consequently, the code might incorrectly treat non-promise values as promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise()` check would return `false`, and the `promise.inspect()` method would not be called. This could cause the code to incorrectly assume that the promise is already fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ state: 'fulfilled' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would not be called on the promise, and an arbitrary object with a `state` property would be used instead. This could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the code that relies on the actual promise's value or state
