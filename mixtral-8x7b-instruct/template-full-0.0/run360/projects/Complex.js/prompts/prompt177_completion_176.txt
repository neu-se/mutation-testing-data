 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the divisor and dividend from the `z` complex number instead of the current complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the reciprocal of the divisor from the `z` complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
d + c
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the divisor and dividend from the `z` complex number instead of multiplying them.

DONE.
