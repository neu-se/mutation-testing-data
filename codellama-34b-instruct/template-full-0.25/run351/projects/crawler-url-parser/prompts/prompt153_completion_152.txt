  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would remove the last part of the URL path, even if it is not a directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is different, and it would remove the last part of the URL path, even if it is not a directory, and also remove any "default" part of the URL path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "").replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, "").replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$
