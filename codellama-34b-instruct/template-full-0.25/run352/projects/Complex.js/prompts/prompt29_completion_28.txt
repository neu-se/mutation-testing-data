  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `b` instead of `a`, which could lead to a different calculation and potentially different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could lead to a different calculation and potentially different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `a` by 2, which could lead to a different calculation and potentially different results.

DONE.
