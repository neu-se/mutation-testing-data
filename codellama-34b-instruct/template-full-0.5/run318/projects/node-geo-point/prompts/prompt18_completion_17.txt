  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of the `isObject` function, so if the object is not an object, it would return `true` instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has a property with the specified name, so if the object does not have a `type` property, it would return `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` property is checked to be a string with the value `'Point'`, so if the object has a different type, it would return `true` instead of `false`.

DONE.
