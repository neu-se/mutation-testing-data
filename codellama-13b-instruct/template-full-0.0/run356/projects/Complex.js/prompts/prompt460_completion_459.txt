  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the `toString()` method to return a string representation of the complex number even if the imaginary part is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the `toString()` method to always return a string representation of the complex number, regardless of whether the imaginary part is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) === Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be true, causing the `toString()` method to always return a string representation of the complex number, regardless of whether the imaginary part is zero.

DONE.
