  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function expects a string as input, but would receive a number (1) instead.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function expects a string as input, but would receive an empty object ({}) instead.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function expects a string as input, but would receive an empty array ([]) instead.

DONE.
