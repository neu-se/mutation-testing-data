  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [main] = getCountriesForTimezone(tzName).filter(tz => tz.name === tzName);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the country with the given timezone name, while this new code fragment first retrieves all countries for the given timezone name and then filters the resulting list to only include the country with the same name as the timezone. In the case where there are multiple countries with the same timezone, this new code fragment would return an empty list, while the original code fragment would return the first country in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [main] = getCountriesForTimezone(tzName).slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment retrieves the country with the given timezone name, while this new code fragment first retrieves all countries for the given timezone name and then slices the resulting list to only include the first country. In the case where there are multiple countries with the same timezone,
