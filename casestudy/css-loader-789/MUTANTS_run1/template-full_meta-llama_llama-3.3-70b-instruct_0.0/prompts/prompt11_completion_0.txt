Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
id === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `id` is strictly equal to `null`, instead of not equal to `null`, which would lead to opposite results in the conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof id === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `id` is undefined, instead of just checking if it's not `null`, which would catch cases where `id` is not defined at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this[i][1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the second element of the array (`this[i][1]`) is falsy, instead of checking if the first element (`id`) is not `null`, which would lead to different import behavior based on the content of the modules.

DONE.
