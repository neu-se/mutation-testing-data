Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly delete one more operation than intended, potentially leading to data loss or incorrect state in the resulting Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the delete operation to remove no elements at all, effectively ignoring the intended deletion and leaving the Delta unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete twice the number of operations as intended, which could lead to an out-of-bounds error or unintended modifications to the Delta's state.

DONE.
