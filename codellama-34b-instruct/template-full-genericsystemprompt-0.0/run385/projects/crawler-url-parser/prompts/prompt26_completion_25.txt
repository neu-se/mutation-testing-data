  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '\\\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#.*$` with an empty string, while the new code fragment replaces it with two backslashes.

DONE.
