  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect()` method to always return a value of 0, regardless of the promise's state or fulfillment value, which would likely cause incorrect results in the `nearer()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect()` method to always return a value of null, regardless of the promise's state or fulfillment value, which would likely cause incorrect results in the `nearer()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to resolve with a value of null, regardless of the promise's state or fulfillment value, which would likely cause incorrect results in the `nearer()` function.

DONE.
