  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match carriage returns instead of newlines, which could cause issues if the input string contains carriage returns.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n{2}/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match two consecutive newlines instead of a single newline, which could cause issues if the input string contains double newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r?\n/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match both carriage returns and newlines, which could cause issues if the input string contains a mixture of both.

DONE.
