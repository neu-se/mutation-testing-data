  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the letter before the last consonant, resulting in incorrect pluralization of some words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the letter before the last vowel, resulting in incorrect pluralization of some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the letter before the second to last vowel, resulting in incorrect pluralization of some words that have more than one vowel.

DONE.
