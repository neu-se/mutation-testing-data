  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is still called with `data`, but the `cb` function is called with `null` as the first argument instead of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is still called with `data`, but the `cb` function is called with `null` as the second argument instead of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is still called with `data`, but the `cb` function is called with `null` as both arguments instead of `data`.

DONE.
