  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at the next index instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at the previous index instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start at a different index than the current one, depending on the value of `baseIndex`.

DONE.
