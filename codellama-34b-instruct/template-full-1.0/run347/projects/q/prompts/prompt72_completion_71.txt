  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function buggyFlush() { throw new Error(" ocasional "+
            "error");}
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error that would cause a failure in the tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function buggyFlush() {return 1;}
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a value of 1 instead of undefined, which would cause the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function buggyFlush() {return "buggy-flush";} 
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a string instead of undefined, which would cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
