Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the entry associated with the current URL string instead of the base URL string, potentially removing the wrong entry from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to delete the entry associated with the `baseUrl` object instead of the string representation of the base URL, which may not match any key in the `urlMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because it clears the entire `urlMap`, removing all entries instead of just the one associated with the base URL string, which would lead to loss of all collected URLs.

DONE.
