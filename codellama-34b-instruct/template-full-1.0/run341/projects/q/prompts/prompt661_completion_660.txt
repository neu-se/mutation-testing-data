  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid method for a promise object, so it would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" is not a valid method for a promise object, so it would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is not a valid method for a promise object, so it would result in an error.

DONE.
