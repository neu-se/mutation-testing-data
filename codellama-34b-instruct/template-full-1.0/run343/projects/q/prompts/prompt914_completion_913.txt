  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because "test" is a string, but the original code fragment is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because 42 is a number, but the original code fragment is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a keyword, but the original code fragment is an object.

DONE.
