  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the result of the `isPromise` function, making the `if` statement always evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state of the promise is not "fulfilled", instead of checking if the object is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the state of the promise is not "rejected", instead of checking if the object is not a promise.

DONE.
