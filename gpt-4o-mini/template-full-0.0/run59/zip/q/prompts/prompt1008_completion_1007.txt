Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index of the slice from 2 to 0, which means it will include the first two arguments instead of skipping them, potentially altering the expected arguments passed to the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments, 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the slice to only one argument (the second argument), which may not include all the necessary arguments that the callback expects, leading to incorrect behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments, 2, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies a length of 0 for the slice, which means it will return an empty array instead of the expected arguments, causing the callback to receive no arguments at all.

DONE.
