  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
32 + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the numbers 32 and 1, resulting in 33, which is different from the original code fragment that captures the line number of the current execution context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world".length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the string "hello world", which is 11, and not the line number of the current execution context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the mathematical constant pi, which is approximately 3.14159, and not the line number of the current execution context.

DONE.
