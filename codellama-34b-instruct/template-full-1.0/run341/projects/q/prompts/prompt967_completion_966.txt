  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var args2 = array_slice(arguments, 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment declares a new variable `args2` and uses `array_slice` to assign a value to it, whereas the original code fragment simply references `args`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment always returns `null`, regardless of the value of `args`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment returns the length of the `args` array, whereas the original code fragment returns the value of `args`.
