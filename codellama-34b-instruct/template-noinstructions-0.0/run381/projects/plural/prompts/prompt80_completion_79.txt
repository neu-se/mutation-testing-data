  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose". Replacing it with `'goose'` would result in the incorrect plural form "goose" instead of "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'geese'`, which is the correct plural form of the word "goose". Replacing it with `'gooses'` would result in the incorrect plural form "gooses" instead of "geese".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, as it is the correct plural form of the word "goose".

DONE.
