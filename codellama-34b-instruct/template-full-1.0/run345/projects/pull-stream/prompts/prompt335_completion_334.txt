  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a data value, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to return `null` instead, which could break the code that relies on the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a data value, but replacing it with a hard-coded string `'hello'` would cause the function to return a completely different value, which could break the code that relies on the expected data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a data value, but replacing it with `data + 1` would cause the function to return a different value that is one greater than the original value, which could break the code that relies on the expected data value.

DONE.
