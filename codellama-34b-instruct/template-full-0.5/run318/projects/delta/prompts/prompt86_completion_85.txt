  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `attributes` are different properties of the `lastOp` object, and the code is checking for the presence of `attributes` specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `attributes` are different properties of the `lastOp` object, and the code is checking for the presence of `attributes` specifically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `attributes` are different properties of the `lastOp` object, and the code is checking for the presence of `attributes` specifically.

DONE.
