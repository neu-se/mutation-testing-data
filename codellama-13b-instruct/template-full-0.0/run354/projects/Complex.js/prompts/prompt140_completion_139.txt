  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either the base or the exponent is infinite, while the new code fragment checks if both the base and the exponent are infinite. This could potentially cause the function to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
