  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' && w !== 'roof'
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `!==` operator instead of `===` to check for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' || w !== 'roof'
```
This code fragment is also functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses the `||` operator instead of `&&` to check for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!w.includes('dwarf') && !w.includes('roof')
```
This code fragment uses the `includes` method to check if the word contains the substring 'dwarf' or 'roof', and negates the result using the `!` operator.

DONE.
