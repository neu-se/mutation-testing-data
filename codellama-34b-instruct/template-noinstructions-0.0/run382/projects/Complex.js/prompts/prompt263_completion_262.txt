  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the resulting angle to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are swapped, which would cause the resulting angle to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to `Math.atan2` are the same, which would cause the resulting angle to be 0, regardless of the actual angle.

DONE.
