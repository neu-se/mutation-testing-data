  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: -length }
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different operations, and negative values for `retain` are not allowed, so this would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ insert: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting a positive value would add new characters to the string, while deleting a positive value would remove characters from the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the `length` would cause the deletion to be one character longer than the original code.

DONE.
