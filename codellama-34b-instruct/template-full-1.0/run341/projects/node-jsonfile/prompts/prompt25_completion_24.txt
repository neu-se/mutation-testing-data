  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would throw a `SyntaxError` in the original code, but not when replaced with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would throw a `SyntaxError` in the original code, but not when replaced with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
 "nemo": "nem",
 "foo": undefined
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` method would throw a `SyntaxError` in the original code if the JSON string contains an invalid property name (e.g. "foo"), but not when replaced with a valid JSON object.

DONE.
