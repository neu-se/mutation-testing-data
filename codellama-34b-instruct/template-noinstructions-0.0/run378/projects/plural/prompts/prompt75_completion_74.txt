  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'die', which would return 'dice' as the plural form, but 'dice' is already a plural form and would not need to be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'die', which would return 'dies' as the plural form, but 'dies' is not a valid plural form for the word 'die'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 'die', which would return 'die' as the plural form, but 'die' is already a singular form and would not need to be pluralized.

DONE.
