 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new deferred object using the Q.defer() method instead of the defer() method, which may have different behavior or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new resolved promise using the Promise.resolve() method instead of using the deferred object, which may cause the continuation to be executed immediately instead of waiting for the original promise to resolve.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.defer()
