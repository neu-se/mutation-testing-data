  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment removes only the last character. This would cause the plural form of words like "cactus" to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment removes only the last character and adds "us" to the end of the word. This would cause the pl
