  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise = value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment of `deferred.promise` would be evaluated but discarded, as it is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the value `0`, whereas the original code fragment calls `deferred.resolve` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `deferred.makeNodeResolver` creates a new resolver function, which is not used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
