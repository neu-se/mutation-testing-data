  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data[key]` is an object property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.exec(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `key.exec(data)` is a function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[key] = value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable, while `data[key] = value` is an assignment statement.

DONE.
