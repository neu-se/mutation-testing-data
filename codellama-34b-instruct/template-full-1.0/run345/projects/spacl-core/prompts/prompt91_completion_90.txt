  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could cause the `for` loop to iterate over the elements in a different order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array, which could cause the `for` loop to skip over elements or iterate over them out of order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element from the array, which could cause the `for` loop to skip over elements or iterate over them out of order.

DONE.
