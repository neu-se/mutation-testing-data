  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical AND operator, which returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy. In this case, the second operand is `true`, so the result would be `true` even if `parsedUrl.protocol` is not `http:` or `https:`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol !== 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol !== 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the result of the comparison, while this replacement code uses the logical AND operator to check if `parsedUrl.protocol` is not equal to `http:` and not equal to `https:`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol.indexOf('http:') === -1 && parsedUrl.protocol.indexOf('https:') === -1
```
This would result in different
