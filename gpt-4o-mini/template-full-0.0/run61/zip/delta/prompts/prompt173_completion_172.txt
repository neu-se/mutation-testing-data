Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the current operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, potentially leading to incorrect operation handling when composing two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a length of zero, effectively ignoring the length of the operation from `otherIter`, which could lead to missing operations during the composition of deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use a fixed length of one, which could cause the algorithm to incorrectly process operations, especially if the actual length of the operation is greater than one.

DONE.
