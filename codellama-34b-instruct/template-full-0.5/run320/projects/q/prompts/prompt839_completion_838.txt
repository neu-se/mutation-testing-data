  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the `then` method, `null` would be treated as a fulfilled value, whereas `undefined` would be treated as a rejected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the `then` method, `false` would be treated as a fulfilled value, whereas `undefined` would be treated as a rejected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number value, whereas `void 0` is a keyword that evaluates to `undefined`. In the context of the `then` method, `0` would be treated as a
