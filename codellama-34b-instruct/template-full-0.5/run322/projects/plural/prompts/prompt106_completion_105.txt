  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' })

```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment added a rule for words that end in "o" and are preceded by a consonant, whereas this new code fragment would add a rule for words that end in "o" and are not preceded by a vowel.
