  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would change the value of `b` and potentially affect the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operation would change the value of `b` and potentially affect the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operation would change the value of `b` and potentially affect the calculation of the `sin` and `cos` functions.

DONE.
