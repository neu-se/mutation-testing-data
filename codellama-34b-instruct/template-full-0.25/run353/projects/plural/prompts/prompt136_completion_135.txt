  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `type` to get the type of the object, while this replacement would return the lowercase version of the type string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `type` to get the type of the object, while this replacement would return the uppercase version of the type string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `type` to get the type of the object, while this replacement would return the type string without the last character.

DONE.
