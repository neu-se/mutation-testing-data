```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` argument passed to the `notify` function would be `null` instead of the expected progress value. This could cause issues if the `progressListener` function being called in the `array_reduce` loop is not equipped to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
