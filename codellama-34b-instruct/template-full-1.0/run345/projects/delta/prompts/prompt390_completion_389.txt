  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to run indefinitely, as `peekLength()` would always return the same value, and the condition `offset <= index` would always be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to exit early, as `peekLength()` would return a different value after the first iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to run for a different number of iterations, as `peekLength()` would return a different value after each iteration.

DONE.
