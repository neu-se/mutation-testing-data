  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b*b` is a multiplication operation. The multiplication would likely produce a different result than the original code, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b+1` is an addition operation. The addition would likely produce a different result than the original code, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, while `b-1` is a subtraction operation. The subtraction would likely produce a different result than the original code, potentially causing the test to fail.

DONE.
