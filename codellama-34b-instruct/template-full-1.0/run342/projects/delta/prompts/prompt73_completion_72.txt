  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("PLACEHOLDER: this.push");
```
This would result in a different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause the code to stop executing and throw an error, whereas the original code would have pushed a new op to the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would remove the last op from the `ops` array, whereas the original code would have pushed a new op to the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would return `null` instead of `this`, whereas the original code would have returned `this` after pushing a new op to the `ops` array.

DONE.
