  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the code to calculate the wrong value for the tangent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to calculate the tangent of the negative of the original complex number, which would give a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to calculate the tangent of a complex number that is one unit greater than the original complex number, which would give a different result.

DONE.
