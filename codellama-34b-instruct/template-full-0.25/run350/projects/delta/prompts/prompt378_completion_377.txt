  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for 'insert' or 'retain', while this code checks only for 'delete'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality, while this code checks for greater than.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' && otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for 'insert' or 'retain', while this code checks only for 'retain'.

DONE.
