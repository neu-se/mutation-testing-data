  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have allowed a length of zero, but the new code would not allow that.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have allowed a length of zero, but the new code would always require a positive length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have allowed a length of zero, but the new code would require a non-zero length.

DONE.
