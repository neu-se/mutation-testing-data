  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator has higher precedence than the read function, so it would be evaluated first and the result would be passed to the read function. The original code would pass the read function itself as the argument to the sink function, whereas this modified code would pass the result of the read function plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the - operator has higher precedence than the read function, so it would be evaluated first and the result would be passed to the read function. The original code would pass the read function itself as the argument to the sink function, whereas this modified code would pass the result of the read function minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator has higher precedence than the read function, so it would be evaluated first and the result would be passed to
