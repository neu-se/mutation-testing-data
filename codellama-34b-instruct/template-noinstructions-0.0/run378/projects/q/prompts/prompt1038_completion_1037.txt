  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a promise, but `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the deferred object, but `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() { return Q.defer(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise.then(function() { return Q.defer(); })` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the deferred object, but `Q.defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object.
