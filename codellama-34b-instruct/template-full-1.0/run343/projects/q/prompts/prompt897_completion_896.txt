  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, regardless of whether the Node function has finished execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Node function did not complete within the expected time frame"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected if the Node function does not complete within the expected time frame.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, without waiting for the Node function to complete.

DONE.
