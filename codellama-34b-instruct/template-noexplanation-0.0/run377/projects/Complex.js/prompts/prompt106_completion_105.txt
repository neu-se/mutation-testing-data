  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This will cause the function to always return NaN, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This will cause the function to always return Infinity, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(0, 0);
```
This will cause the function to always return the complex number 0 + 0i, regardless of the input.

DONE.
