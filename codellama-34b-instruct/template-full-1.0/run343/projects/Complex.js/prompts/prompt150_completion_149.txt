  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, and the original code uses `this['isInfinite']()` to check if the current object is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have an `isInfinite()` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if it was replaced.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have an `isInfinite()` method, so the code would throw a `TypeError` if it was replaced.

DONE.
