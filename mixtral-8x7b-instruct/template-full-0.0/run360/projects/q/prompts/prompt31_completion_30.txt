 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `laterQueue` array instead of popping the last element, which can change the order of task execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
    laterQueue.pop();
    return 42;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `42`, which is not the original behavior of the code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random
