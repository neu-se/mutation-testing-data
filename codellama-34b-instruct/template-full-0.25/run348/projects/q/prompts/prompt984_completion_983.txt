  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, while `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, while `null` would resolve it with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with an error, while `deferred.reject("error")` would reject the promise with a specific error message.

DONE.
