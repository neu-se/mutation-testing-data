Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always return `false` regardless of the actual result of `policy.query`, effectively denying any action even if it is allowed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of `policy.query`, meaning that if an action is allowed, it will return `false`, and if it is denied, it will return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `matches` method instead of the `query` method, which may lead to incorrect results regarding whether an action is allowed or denied based on path matching rather than action querying.

DONE.
