  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different objects, and `a` is not necessarily a subset of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is not necessarily a subset of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a || b` is not necessarily equal to `a` or `b` if they are both objects.

DONE.
