 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the part into individual characters instead of treating it as a single string, potentially causing issues in the pattern matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the part to uppercase, which might not match the expected behavior if the input contains case-sensitive parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globalThis[part]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the part as a property of the global `this` object, which would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior if the property does not exist.

DONE.
