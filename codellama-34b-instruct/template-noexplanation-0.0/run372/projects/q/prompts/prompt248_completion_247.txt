  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This code fragment will return the index of the last occurrence of the newline character in the stack trace, which may be different from the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") - 1
```
This code fragment will return the index of the first occurrence of the newline character in the stack trace, minus one. This may result in a negative index, which may cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This code fragment will return the length of the stack trace, which may be different from the index of the first occurrence of the newline character.

DONE.
