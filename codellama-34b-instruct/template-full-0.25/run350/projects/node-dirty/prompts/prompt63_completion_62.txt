  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would cause the write stream to close immediately, rather than waiting for all data to be flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would cause the write stream to close immediately, rather than waiting for all data to be flushed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy())
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would cause the write stream to close immediately, and the callback function would be called after the stream has been closed, rather than waiting for all data to be flushed.

DONE.
