  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with `null` as an argument, which would cause it to exit the loop immediately, even if there are still more data to be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with `undefined` as an argument, which would cause it to exit the loop immediately, even if there are still more data to be read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` function would be called with `false` as an argument, which would cause it to exit the loop immediately, even if there are still more data to be read.

DONE.
