Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `true` when there is a match, instead of returning `false` when there is no match, leading to the opposite logic in the matching process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if there are no capturing groups in the regex, regardless of whether the path matches the regex or not, potentially allowing paths that should be denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if there are no matches found, which is incorrect since `match` could be an array with a length greater than zero but still not match the expected values.

DONE.
