  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the length of the current operation as the number of characters to consume from the other delta, while replacing it with 0 would cause it to consume the entire other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the length of the current operation as the number of characters to consume from the other delta, while replacing it with length - 1 would cause it to consume one fewer character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherDelta.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the length of the current operation as the number of characters to consume from the other delta, while replacing it with otherDelta.length would cause it to consume the entire other delta.

DONE.
