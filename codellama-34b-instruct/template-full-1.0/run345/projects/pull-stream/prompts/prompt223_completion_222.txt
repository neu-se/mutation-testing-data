  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.not.accept(test)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `not` method is not defined in the `tester` object, and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tester.filter(function (data) { return !test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is not defined in the `tester` object, and will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function (test) { return !test(data) })
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function is not defined in the `tester` object, and will always return true if `test` is a function.

DONE.
