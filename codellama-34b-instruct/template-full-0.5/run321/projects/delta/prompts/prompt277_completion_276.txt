  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current line, while `iter.peek()` returns the next line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peekType()` returns the type of the current line, while `iter.peek()` returns the next line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek()` returns the next line, while `iter.peekLength()` and `iter.peekType()` return information about the current line.

DONE.
