  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear the entire `ops` array, whereas `pop` only removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all elements from the `ops` array, whereas `pop` only removes the last element.

DONE.
