  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not throw an error, while the buggy code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue executing the function, while the buggy code would return early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return true, while the buggy code would return false.

DONE.
