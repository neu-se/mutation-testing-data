  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, but replacing it with null would cause the callback to be called with an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, but replacing it with undefined would cause the callback to be called with an array containing a single undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an array of arguments, but replacing it with 0 would cause the callback to be called with an array containing a single 0 value.

DONE.
