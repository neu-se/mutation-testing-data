  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    deferred.resolve();
}, function (reason) {
    deferred.reject(reason);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would handle the rejection of the promise and resolve the deferred promise with the rejection reason, whereas the original code would simply reject the deferred promise with the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function () {
    deferred.resolve();
}, function (reason) {
    deferred.reject(reason);
});
