  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `.includes()` provides a different way of checking if a substring exists in a string, whereas `.indexOf()` checks the index at which the substring appears. In this case, if `.includes()` is used instead of `.indexOf()`, the `node.js` string check would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.contains
```
This would result in different behavior because `.contains()` is not a valid JavaScript method for strings. The code would produce a syntax error, which would likely affect the behavior of the entire program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `.match()` is a valid JavaScript method for strings, but it returns a different type of result than `.indexOf()`. The code would need to be modified to use the result of `.match()` differently, which could change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
