  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `otherOp.delete` is a number and `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null. The modified code fragment would check if `otherOp.delete` is a number and `thisOp.retain` is either a number or an object that is not null, but also checks if `thisOp.retain` is an object that is not null. This would result in a different behavior because the modified code fragment would allow `thisOp.retain` to be an object that is not null, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'number' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
