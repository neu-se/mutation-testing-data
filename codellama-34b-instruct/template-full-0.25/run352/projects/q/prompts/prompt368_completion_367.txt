  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the value passed to it, while `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns the value passed to it, while `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("test"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a new error, while the original code would only reject the promise with the given exception.

DONE.
