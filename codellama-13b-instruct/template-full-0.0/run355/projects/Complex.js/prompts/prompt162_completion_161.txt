  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `z` object instead of the `Complex` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called on the `z` object instead of the `Complex` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is being called on the `Complex` class instead of the `z` object.

DONE.
