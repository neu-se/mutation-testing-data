  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `collect.pop` removes the last element of the `collect` array, whereas `collect.push` adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
collect.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `collect.shift` removes the first element of the `collect` array, whereas `collect.push` adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.sort.call(collect, function(a, b) { return b - a; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it sorts the `collect` array in descending order, whereas `collect.push` adds a new element to the end of the array without changing the order of the existing elements.

DONE.
