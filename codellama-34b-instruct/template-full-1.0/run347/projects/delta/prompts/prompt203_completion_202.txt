  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` will delete the contents of the delta, whereas `delta.concat` will concatenate the contents of the delta with another delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain` will apply an attribute to the contents of the delta, whereas `delta.concat` will concatenate the contents of the delta with another delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.insert` will insert a new line at the current cursor position, whereas `delta.concat` will concatenate the contents of the delta with another delta.

DONE.
