  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment uses a modulo of 3 instead of 2, which would change the sign of the number being added to the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '' : '-' ) + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment uses an empty string instead of a hyphen when the number is negative, which would flip the sign of the number being added to the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? 'x' : '') + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment uses the letter 'x' instead of a hyphen or empty string, which would change the resulting string and cause the parseFloat function to return NaN.

DONE.
