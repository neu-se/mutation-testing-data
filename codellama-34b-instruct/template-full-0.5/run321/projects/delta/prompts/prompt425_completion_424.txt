  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof module === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof module` would return `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`, causing the `module.exports` assignment to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof window` would return `'object'` instead of `'undefined'`, causing the `module.exports` assignment to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof exports` would return `'undefined'` instead of `'object'`, causing the `module.exports` assignment to fail.

DONE.
