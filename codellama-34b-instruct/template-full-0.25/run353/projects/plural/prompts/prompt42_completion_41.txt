  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the length of the word to determine the index of the character to replace, while the new code fragment is using a fixed index of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the length of the word to determine the index of the character to replace, while the new code fragment is using a fixed index of the length of the word minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the length of the word to determine the index of the character to replace, while the new code fragment is using a fixed index of the length of the word minus 2.

DONE.
