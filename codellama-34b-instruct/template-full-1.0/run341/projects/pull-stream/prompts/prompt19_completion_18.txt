  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different element in the `ref` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `length` property of the first element in the `ref` array, which may not exist or may have a different value than the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the first element of the first element in the `ref` array, which may not exist or may have a different value than the first element of the first element.

DONE.
