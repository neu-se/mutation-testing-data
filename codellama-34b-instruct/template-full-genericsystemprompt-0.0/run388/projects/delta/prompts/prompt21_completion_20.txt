  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check for deep equality, but only for reference equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for deep equality if `a[key]` is not undefined, which could lead to false positives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for deep equality if `a[key]` is not null, which could lead to false positives.

DONE.
