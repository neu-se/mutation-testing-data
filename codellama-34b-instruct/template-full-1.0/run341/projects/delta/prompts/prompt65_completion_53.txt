  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` method to return the empty object `{}` instead of the desired object `newOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` method to return the empty array `[]` instead of the desired object `newOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` method to return `undefined` instead of the desired object `newOp`.

DONE.
