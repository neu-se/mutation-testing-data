  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'warn'`, which would cause the `emit` function to trigger the `'warn'` event instead of the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'error'`, which would cause the `emit` function to trigger the `'error'` event instead of the `'error'` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed from `'error'` to `'close'`, which would cause the `emit` function to trigger the `'close'` event instead of the `'error'` event.

DONE.
