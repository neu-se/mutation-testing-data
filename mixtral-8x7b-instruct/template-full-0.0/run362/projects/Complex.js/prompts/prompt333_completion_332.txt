 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the special case for `b` equal to 1 would not be handled correctly, and the function would return an incorrect result or throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the special case for `b` equal to 0 would be handled incorrectly, and the function would return an incorrect result or throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the special case for `b` equal to -2 was not present in the original code, and the function would return a result that is not consistent with the expected behavior for this input.

DONE.
