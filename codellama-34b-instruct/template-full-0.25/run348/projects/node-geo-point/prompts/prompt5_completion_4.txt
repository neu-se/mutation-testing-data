  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `type` property, while this new code fragment checks if the `point` object does not have a `type` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `type` property that is equal to `'Point'`, while this new code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `type` property that is not equal to `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `coordinates` property that is an array with 2 elements, while this new code fragment checks if the `point` object has a `coordinates
