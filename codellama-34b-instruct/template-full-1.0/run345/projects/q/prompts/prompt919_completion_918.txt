  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeNodeResolver` would not be called, which is necessary for the node function to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeNodeResolver` would not be called with the correct argument, which is necessary for the node function to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeNodeResolver` would not be called with the correct argument, which is necessary for the node function to work correctly.

DONE.
