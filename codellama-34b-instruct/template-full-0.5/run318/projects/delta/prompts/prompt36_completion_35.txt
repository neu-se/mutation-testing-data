  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` is always truthy, whereas `!priority` is only truthy when `priority` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for strict equality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, whereas the original code fragment only checks for inequality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for inequality between `a[key]` and `b[key]`, whereas the original code fragment only checks for strict equality.

DONE.
