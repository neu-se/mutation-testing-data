  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the other iter instead of the this iter, which could result in the diff algorithm producing different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract one from the current length, which could result in the diff algorithm considering fewer components.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only the first element of the array, which could result in the diff algorithm omitting some components.

DONE.
