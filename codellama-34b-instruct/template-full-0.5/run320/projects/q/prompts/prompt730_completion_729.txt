  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise immediately, whereas `deferred.notify` would only notify the promise of progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise immediately, whereas `deferred.notify` would only notify the promise of progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would not notify the promise of progress, whereas `deferred.notify` would.

DONE.
