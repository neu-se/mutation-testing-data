 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.concat(content.replace)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the result of `content.replace` to a string, which may cause issues if the result is expected to be a function or other data type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toString().replace
```
This would result in different behavior because it first converts the `content` to a string, which may not have the desired effect if `content` is a Buffer or another non-string data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/g/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only replaces the first occurrence of the matched string, instead of all occurrences as the original code does with the global flag `/g`.

DONE.
