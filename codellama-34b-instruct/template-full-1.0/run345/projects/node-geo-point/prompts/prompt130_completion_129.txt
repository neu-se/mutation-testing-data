  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be replaced with `null`, which would cause the `toTile` function to throw a `TypeError` because it is not callable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be replaced with `0`, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a `Tile` object with `x` and `y` values of `0`, regardless of the coordinates of the input `LatLng` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would be replaced with `undefined`, which would cause the `toTile` function to return a `Tile` object with `x` and `y` values of `undefined`, regardless of the coordinates of the input `LatLng` object.

DONE.
