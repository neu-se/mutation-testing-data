  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would not be called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would be called when the promise is rejected, but it would be passed the rejection reason instead of the progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` function would be called when the promise is fulfilled, but it would be passed the fulfillment value instead of the progress value.

DONE.
