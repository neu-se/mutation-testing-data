  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(this.ops[this.index]) - this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.offset` property is not accounted for in the original `Op.length()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(this.ops[this.index]) + this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.offset` property is not accounted for in the original `Op.length()` method, and the addition operation would introduce a new bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(this.ops[this.index]) * this.offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this.offset` property is not accounted for in the original `Op.length()` method, and the multiplication operation would introduce a new bug.

DONE.
