  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call` is a different function than `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, and it may not have the same behavior when used as a method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable` is a different method than `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, and it may not have the same behavior when used as a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf` is a different method than `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty`, and it may not have the same behavior when used as a method.

DONE.
