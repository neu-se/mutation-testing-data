  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memas'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong plural form for the word "memo."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'undos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong plural form for the word "memo."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'pizzas'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the wrong plural form for the word "memo."

DONE.
