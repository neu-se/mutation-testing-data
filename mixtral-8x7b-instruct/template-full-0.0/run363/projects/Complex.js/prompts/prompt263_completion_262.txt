 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(b, -a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the argument to atan2 is flipped, which can change the quadrant of the resulting angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(b / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because atan2 takes into account the signs of both arguments to compute the correct quadrant of the result, while atan does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(a / b)
```
This would result in different behavior because atan2 takes into account the signs of both arguments to compute the correct quadrant of the result, while swapping the arguments and using atan would not.

DONE.
