  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[args.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the last element of the `args` array as the value for the argument, rather than the default behavior of using the second to last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the values of the `args` object as the arguments, rather than the default behavior of using the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to each element of the `args` array, rather than using the default behavior of not modifying the arguments.

DONE.
