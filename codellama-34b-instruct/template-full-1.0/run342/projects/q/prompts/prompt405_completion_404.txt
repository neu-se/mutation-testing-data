  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the promise to reject instead of resolving.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return void 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of a promise, which would cause the function to return an unfulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of a promise, which would cause the function to return an unfulfilled promise.

DONE.
