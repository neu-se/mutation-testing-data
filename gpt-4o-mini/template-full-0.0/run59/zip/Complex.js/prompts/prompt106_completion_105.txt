Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of terminating the execution with `parser_exit()`, which likely throws an error or exits the parser, returning `null` would allow the function to continue executing and potentially return an invalid or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which may handle the error in a specific way, throwing a new error would disrupt the flow and require the caller to handle the exception, potentially leading to unhandled exceptions if not properly caught.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of terminating the execution with `parser_exit()`, which likely stops further processing, logging the message would allow the function to continue executing, potentially leading to further errors or incorrect results without any indication of the issue.

DONE.
