  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so the promise would not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `then` method, so the promise would not be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object `{}` is a truthy value and has a `then` method, but it would not be a promise, so the promise would not be resolved.

DONE.
