  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function that is called with `this` set to the promise, but `this.then.call(null)` would call the function with `this` set to `null`, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function that is called with `this` set to the promise, but `this.then.bind(null)` would create a new function that is bound to `null`, which would likely cause an error when it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function that is called with `this` set to the promise, but `this.then.apply(null)` would call the function
