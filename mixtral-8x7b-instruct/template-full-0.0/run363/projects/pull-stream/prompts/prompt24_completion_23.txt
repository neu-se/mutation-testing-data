 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the `ref` array is used instead of the second one, potentially causing incorrect data to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element of the `ref` array is removed and used, potentially causing data loss or incorrect data to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `ref` array is removed and used, potentially causing data loss or incorrect data to be processed.

DONE.
