  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a boolean value, and the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `return Q(result.value)` statement to be executed, which would return a promise for the value of `result`, rather than a promise for the value of `result.value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a boolean value, and the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `return when(result.value, callback, errback)` statement to be executed, which would return a promise for the value of `result.value`, rather than a promise for the value of `result`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.value` is not a boolean value, and the `if
