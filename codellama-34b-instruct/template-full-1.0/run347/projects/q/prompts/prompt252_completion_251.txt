  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call(resolvedPromise, ...args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would bind the `this` context to `resolvedPromise`, while `apply` would bind it to `newPromise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch(...args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method directly on `resolvedPromise`, while `apply` would call it on `newPromise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(resolvedPromise).apply(null, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would create a new function that would bind the `this` context to `resolvedPromise`, while `apply` would call the `promiseDispatch` method with `null` as the `this` context.
