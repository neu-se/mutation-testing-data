  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this modified code fragment logs the value of `data + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this modified code fragment logs the value of `data` in upper case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `data`, while this modified code fragment logs the length of `data`.

DONE.
