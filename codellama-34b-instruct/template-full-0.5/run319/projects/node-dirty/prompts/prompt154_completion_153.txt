  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a bug where it was not passing any arguments to `uncork`, which would cause the stream to be uncorked with a default value of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a bug where it was not passing any arguments to `uncork`, which would cause the stream to be uncorked with a default value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment had a bug where it was not passing any arguments to `uncork`, which would cause the stream to be uncorked with a default value of `true`.

DONE.
