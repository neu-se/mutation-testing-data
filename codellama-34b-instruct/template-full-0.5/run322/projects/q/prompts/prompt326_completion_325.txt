  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the replaced code fragment is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable name, while the replaced code fragment is a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the replaced code fragment is a function definition.

DONE.
