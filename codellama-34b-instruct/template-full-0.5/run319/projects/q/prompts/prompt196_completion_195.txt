  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with no arguments, which would return `undefined` instead of the expected array of filename and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with the `stackLine` argument, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber(stackLine, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function with the `stackLine` argument and an additional argument of `1`, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
