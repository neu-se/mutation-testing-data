  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] !== ' ' && !isNaN(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and not a number, while the replaced code fragment checks if the next token is not a space and not a number, but also checks if the next token is not a space and not a number again. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases, such as when the next token is a space or a number.

DONE.
