  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with a different number of arguments than the original code, which would cause the `switch` statement to execute a different branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `pull` function with the same arguments as the original code, but with a different order, which would cause the `switch` statement to execute a different branch.

pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[3], ref[4])
