  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a + b```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + b` expression is not the same as the original `a, b` fragment. The `a + b` expression would result in the sum of `a` and `b`, while the original fragment would result in the combination of `a` and `b` separated by a comma.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a - b```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - b` expression is not the same as the original `a, b` fragment. The `a - b` expression would result in the difference of `a` and `b`, while the original fragment would result in the combination of `a` and `b` separated by a comma.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a * b```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * b` expression is not the same as the original `a, b` fragment. The `a * b` expression would result in the
