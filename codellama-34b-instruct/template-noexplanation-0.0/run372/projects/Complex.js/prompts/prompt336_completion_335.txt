```
This change will cause the `atan` function to return a different value than the original code, which is `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This change will cause the `atan` function to return a different value than the original code, which is `-1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This change will cause the `atan` function to return a different value than the original code, which is `Infinity`.

DONE.
