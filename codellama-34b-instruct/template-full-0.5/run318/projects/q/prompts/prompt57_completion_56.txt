  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called with a `this` value of `null`, rather than being passed as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be called with a `this` value of `null`, rather than being passed as a callback to `process.nextTick`.

DONE.
