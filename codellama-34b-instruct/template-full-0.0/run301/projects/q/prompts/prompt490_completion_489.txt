  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `rejected` value, causing the `untrackRejection` function to be called even if the promise is not rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, causing the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if `rejected` is truthy and `false` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, causing the `untrackRejection` function to be called only if `rejected` is falsy or `true` is truthy.

DONE.
