  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFunction` checks if a value is a function, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `isArray` checks if a value is an array, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isString
```
This would result in different behavior because `isString` checks if a value is a string, while `isObject` checks if a value is an object.

DONE.
