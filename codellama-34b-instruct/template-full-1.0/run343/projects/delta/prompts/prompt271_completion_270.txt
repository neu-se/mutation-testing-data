  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& iter.peekLength() > 0` condition would ensure that the loop only continues if the next op has a non-zero length, which is not the case in the original code. This modification would result in the loop terminating earlier because it would skip over any ops with zero length, which could cause the resulting delta to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() || thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the loop to continue as long as either iterator has a next op, regardless of the length of the op. This modification would result in the loop continuing too long, potentially causing the resulting delta to contain incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() || !otherIter.hasNext()
```
