  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This change will cause the `array_slice` function to start from the second argument instead of the third, which may cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This change will cause the `array_slice` function to start from the third argument instead of the second, which may cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This change will cause the `array_slice` function to start from the fourth argument instead of the second, which may cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
