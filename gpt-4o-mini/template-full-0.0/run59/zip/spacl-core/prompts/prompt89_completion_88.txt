Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` instead of the actual `policy` object, causing the `PolicyMap` to not store the policies correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.id, policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `policy.id` instead of `policy.name`, which may not be unique or may not exist, leading to incorrect mapping of policies in the `PolicyMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name.toUpperCase(), policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the `policy.name` to uppercase, which could lead to case sensitivity issues when querying the `PolicyMap`, potentially causing lookups to fail.

DONE.
