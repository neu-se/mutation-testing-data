  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.values[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a single value, while this option returns the first value in the values array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a single value, while this option returns the first character of the value string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a value with the literal value 1 added to it, while this option returns the result of an addition operation with a string and the number 1.

DONE.
