  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate in reverse order, starting from the last rule instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1; i <= rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the first rule and iterate over the remaining rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = rules.length; i > 0; i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the rules in reverse order, starting from the last rule and ending at the first rule.

DONE.
