  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the new code fragment adds 1 to the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the new code fragment multiplies the value of `x` by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `x` directly, while the new code fragment divides the value of `x` by 2.

DONE.
