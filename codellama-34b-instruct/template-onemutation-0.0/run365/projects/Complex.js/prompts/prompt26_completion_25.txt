  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid Param');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a `SyntaxError`, while the new code fragment throws an `Error` object. The `Error` object is a more general error type that can be used to represent a wider range of errors, including invalid parameters.
