  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the last letter of the word with 'ves', while the buggy code fragment uses the `replace` method to replace the entire word with 'ves'. This would result in the plural form of the word being 'ves' instead of the expected 'veses'.
