Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the hours calculation would be based on twice the offset value, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because the absolute value of the offset would be used for hours calculation, potentially leading to incorrect sign in the final offset string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the hours calculation would be based on the utcOffset variable instead of the offset parameter passed to the function, potentially leading to incorrect results when calculating the offset string for dstOffset.

DONE.
