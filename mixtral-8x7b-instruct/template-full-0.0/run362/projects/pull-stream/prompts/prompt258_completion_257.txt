 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk` function would continue to execute even when an error other than `true` is encountered, which might not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextChunk` function would only continue to execute when the error is exactly equal to `1`, which is different from the original behavior of continuing when the error is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err !== true
