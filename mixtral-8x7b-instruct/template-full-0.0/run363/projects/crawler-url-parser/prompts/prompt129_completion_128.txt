 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a valid URL object, and null would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype` function expects a URL object with specific properties, and an empty object would not have those properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ protocol: 'http:', host: 'example.com' }
