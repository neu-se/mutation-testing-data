  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from the second element, rather than the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element, rather than the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the `other.ops` array starting from the second element and ending at the second-to-last element, rather than the entire array.

DONE.
