  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the content string, which could potentially change the JSON string that is being parsed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the content string to uppercase, which could potentially change the JSON string that is being parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the content string into an array of individual characters, which could potentially change the JSON string that is being parsed.

DONE.
