  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(10).startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with an argument of `10` would remove the first 10 characters from the `url` string, potentially changing the protocol from `https` to `http`, which would cause the `request` variable to be assigned the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft().startsWith('http')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method without an argument would remove all whitespace characters from the beginning of the `url` string, potentially changing the protocol from `https` to `http`, which would cause the `request` variable to be assigned the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith('https')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight` method would remove all whitespace characters from the end of the `url` string,
