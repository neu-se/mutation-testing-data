  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.includes(Buffer.isBuffer)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the given element is present in the array, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the object is a buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content[0] === Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `content[0]` checks the first element of the array, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the object is a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.length === Buffer.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.length` checks the length of the array, whereas `Buffer.isBuffer` checks if the object is a buffer.

DONE.
