  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, _value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would not be called with `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `cb` is reversed, so the `null` value would be passed as the first argument instead of the second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not equal to `null`, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `cb` function would not be called with `null` as an argument.

DONE.
