  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/\d+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only if the part contains at least one digit, whereas the original code fragment matches any non-empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/[a-zA-Z]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only if the part contains at least one letter, whereas the original code fragment matches any non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only if the part contains at least one letter or digit, whereas the original code fragment matches any non-empty string.

DONE.
