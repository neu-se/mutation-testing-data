 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `lineNumber === <PLACEHOLDER>` would always be false if `lineNumber` is not the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `lineNumber === <PLACEHOLDER>` would always be false if `lineNumber` is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'foo'
