  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set to a truthy value, while the new code fragment checks if the `process` object has an `env` property that is an object with a `Q_DEBUG` property that is set to a truthy value. This could result in different behavior if the `process` object or the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is not defined in the current environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process && process.env && process.env.Q_DEBUG

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `Q_DEBUG` environment variable is set to a truthy value, while the new code fragment checks if the `process` object has an `env` property that is an object with a `Q_DEBUG` property that is set to a truthy value.
