  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next iteration is an insert, while this one checks if it is not an insert. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the next iteration is not an insert.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next iteration is an insert, while this one checks if it is a retain. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the next iteration is a retain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the next iteration is an insert, while this one checks if it is not a delete. This would cause the code to behave differently in the case where the next iteration is not
