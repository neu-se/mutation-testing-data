  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved with the result of the `progress` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` function would be called with an empty function as the first argument, which would not have the same effect as calling the `progress` function with the `progressed` argument.

DONE.
