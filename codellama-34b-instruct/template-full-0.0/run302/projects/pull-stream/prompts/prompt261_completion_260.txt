  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would not be called, which could cause the program to hang or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function `cb` would be called with a different argument, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` argument would be `null`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
