  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `isInfinite()` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero()` checks if it is zero. This would cause the method to return a different result for some inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` inverts the result of the method call. This would cause the method to return a different result for some inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the method `isNaN()` checks if the complex number is not a number (NaN), while `isZero()` checks if it is zero. This would cause the method to return a different result for some inputs.

DONE.
