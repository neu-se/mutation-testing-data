  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to match only lowercase characters, whereas the original code fragment matches both uppercase and lowercase characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to match only the first word of the stack line, whereas the original code fragment matches the entire stack line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the regular expression to match only the second and subsequent words of the stack line, whereas the original code fragment matches the first word of the stack line.

DONE.
