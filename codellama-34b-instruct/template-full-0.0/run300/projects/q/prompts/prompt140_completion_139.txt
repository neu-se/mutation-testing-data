  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` otherwise. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is truthy and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && !p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which returns the first falsy operand or the last operand if all operands are truthy. In this case, if `p` is truthy, the expression would return `false`, and if `p` is falsy, the expression would return `true`.
