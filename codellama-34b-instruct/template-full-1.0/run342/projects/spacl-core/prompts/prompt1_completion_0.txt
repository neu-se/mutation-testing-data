  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for equality in value and type, whereas the original code fragment only checked for equality in value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.matches(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.matches()` method is not defined for strings in JavaScript, so this code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== spec.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spec.length` property is not a regular expression, so this comparison would always be `false`.

DONE.
