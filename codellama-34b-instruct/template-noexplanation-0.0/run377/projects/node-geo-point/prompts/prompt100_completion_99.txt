  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) + 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it adds 360 to the result of the `rad2deg` function, which could cause the bearing to be off by 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) - 360
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it subtracts 360 from the result of the `rad2deg` function, which could cause the bearing to be off by -360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2) * 2
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it multiplies the result of the `rad2deg` function by 2, which could cause the bearing to be off by a factor of 2.

DONE.
