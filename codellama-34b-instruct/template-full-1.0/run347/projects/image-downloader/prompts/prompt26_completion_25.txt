  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is a built-in constructor function in JavaScript, whereas `request` is a reference to the `request` module imported at the top of the file. Using `promise` instead of `request` would result in a different function being called, which could have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Promise'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise` is a constructor function in JavaScript, but it's also a string. Passing a string instead of a function reference would cause the code to fail when trying to call the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Request
```
This would result in different behavior because `Request` is a different module than `request`. Using `Request` instead of `request` would likely cause the code to fail when trying to import a module that doesn't exist.

DONE.
