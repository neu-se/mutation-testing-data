  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if the queue size is zero, while the new code fragment uses the equality operator (===) to check if the queue size is equal to zero. These operators have different behavior when dealing with non-boolean values, and in this case, the equality operator will return true if the queue size is zero, while the logical NOT operator will return false.

DONE.
