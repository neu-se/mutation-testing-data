  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code>thisIter.ops;</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` is an instance of `OpIterator`, which does not have an `ops` property. Accessing `thisIter.ops` would return `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the following code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code>otherIter[1]</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter` is an instance of `OpIterator`, which does not have a property named `1`. Accessing `otherIter[1]` would return `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the following code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code>thisIter[1]</code>
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` is an instance of `OpIterator`, which does not have a property named `1`. Accessing `thisIter[1]` would return `undefined`, which could cause unexpected
