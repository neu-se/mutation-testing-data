  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `void 0`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `void 0`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different value than the original code.

DONE.
