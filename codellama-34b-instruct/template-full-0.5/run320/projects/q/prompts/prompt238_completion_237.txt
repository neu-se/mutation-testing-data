  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `nearerValue`, which could potentially change the outcome of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the value of `nearerValue`, which could potentially change the outcome of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `nearerValue` by 2, which could potentially change the outcome of the expression.

DONE.
