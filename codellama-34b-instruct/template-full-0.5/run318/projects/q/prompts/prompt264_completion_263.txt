  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a different function than `fulfill`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a different function than `fulfill`, and it would cause the promise to be resolved instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a different function than `fulfill`, and it would cause the promise to be notified instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
