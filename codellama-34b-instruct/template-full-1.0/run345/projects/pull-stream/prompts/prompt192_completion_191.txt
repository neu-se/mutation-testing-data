  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!map
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `map` variable, causing the if statement to always evaluate to `false` and the `id` function to be returned, even if a `map` function was passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
map + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` variable is now a number equal to the value of `map + 1`, causing the `prop` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the `map` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"map"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `prop` function is now being called with a string argument, which could potentially lead to different behavior in the `map` function.

DONE.
