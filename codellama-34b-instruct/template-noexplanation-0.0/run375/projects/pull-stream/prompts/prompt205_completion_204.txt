  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a `null` value instead of the `end` value, which may cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with an `undefined` value instead of the `end` value, which may cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a `false` value instead of the `end` value, which may cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
