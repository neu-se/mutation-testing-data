  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg, !priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `priority`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `priority` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator increments the value of `arg`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `arg` is a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator decrements the value of `arg`, which would cause the `transformPosition` method to behave differently when `arg` is a non-zero value.

DONE.
