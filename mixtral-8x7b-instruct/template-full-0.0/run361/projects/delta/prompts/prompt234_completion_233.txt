 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.push('incorrect value')
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a string instead of an operation object into the `retDelta` array, which may cause unexpected results when processing further operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.pop
