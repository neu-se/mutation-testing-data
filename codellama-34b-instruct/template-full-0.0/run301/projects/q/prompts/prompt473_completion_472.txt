  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `untrackRejection` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the entire `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `untrackRejection` function.

DONE.
