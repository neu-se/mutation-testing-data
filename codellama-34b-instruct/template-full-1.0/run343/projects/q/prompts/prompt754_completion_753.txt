  And then turn the code into a silientched warning for the user.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a static method, whereas `this` is an instance of `Promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a static method, whereas `Promise` is a constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a static method, whereas `Q` is a promise library.

DONE.
