  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This will cause the `transform` function to use the values of the `b` object instead of its keys, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This will cause the `transform` function to use the entries of the `b` object instead of its keys, which will result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).reverse()
```
This will cause the `transform` function to use the keys of the `b` object in reverse order, which will result in a different behavior.

DONE.
