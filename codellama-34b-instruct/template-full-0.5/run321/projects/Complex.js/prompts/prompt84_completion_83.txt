  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part is inverted, which would cause the parser to exit with an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part is inverted, which would cause the parser to exit with an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part is not taken into account, which would cause the parser to exit with an incorrect result.

DONE.
