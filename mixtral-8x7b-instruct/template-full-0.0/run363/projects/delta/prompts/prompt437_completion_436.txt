 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp['attributes']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `attributes` property as an indexer, which would return `undefined` if the property does not exist, instead of throwing a `TypeError` when accessing a non-existent property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
nextOp.hasOwnProperty('attributes')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `attributes` property exists in the `nextOp` object, returning a boolean instead of returning the value of the `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Reflect.get(nextOp, 'attributes')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Reflect.get` method to retrieve the value of the `attributes` property, which allows for more advanced property access control compared to the dot notation.

DONE.
