  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and it is used to convert degrees to radians in the original code. Replacing it with a different value would result in a different calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `Math.E` is a constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm, and it is used to calculate the bearing between two points in the original code. Replacing it with a different value would result in a different calculation of the bearing between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.LN2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `Math.LN2` is a constant that represents the natural logarithm of 2, and it is used to
