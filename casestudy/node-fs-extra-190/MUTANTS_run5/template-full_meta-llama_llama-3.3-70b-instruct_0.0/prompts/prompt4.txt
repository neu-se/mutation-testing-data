Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
var fs = require('graceful-fs')

var BUF_LENGTH = 64 * 1024
var _buff = new Buffer(BUF_LENGTH)

function copyFileSync (srcFile, destFile, options) {
  var clobber = options.clobber
  var preserveTimestamps = options.preserveTimestamps

  if (fs.existsSync(destFile)) {
    if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {
      fs.unlinkSync(destFile)
    } else {
      throw Error('EEXIST')
    }
  }

  var fdr = fs.openSync(srcFile, 'r')
  var stat = fs.fstatSync(fdr)
  var fdw = fs.openSync(destFile, 'w', stat.mode)
  var bytesRead = 1
  var pos = 0

  while (bytesRead > 0) {
    bytesRead = fs.readSync(fdr, _buff, 0, BUF_LENGTH, pos)
    fs.writeSync(fdw, _buff, 0, bytesRead)
    pos += bytesRead
  }

  if (preserveTimestamps) {
    fs.futimesSync(fdw, stat.atime, stat.mtime)
  }

  fs.closeSync(fdr)
  fs.closeSync(fdw)
}

module.exports = copyFileSync

```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
clobber
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
