  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always be false, causing the code to return early without applying any operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true for every even index, causing the code to apply operations on every even index, and not on every odd index as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would only be true for the first index, and the code would only apply operations on the first index, and not on any other indices.

DONE.
