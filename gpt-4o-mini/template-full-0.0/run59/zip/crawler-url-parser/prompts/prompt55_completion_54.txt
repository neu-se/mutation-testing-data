Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = URL.format(parsedBaseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns the formatted base URL to `currentUrlStr` instead of the resolved absolute URL, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing and resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
absoluteUrl = URL.format(parsedUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `parsedUrl` instead of the intended `absoluteUrl`, which may not represent the correct resolved URL, leading to incorrect results in the parsing logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr = URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly assigns the resolved URL to `currentUrlStr` without formatting it, which may lead to an incorrect URL structure being used in subsequent operations.

DONE.
