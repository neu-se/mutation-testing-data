  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a different function from `rejected`, and it would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, whereas the original code would reject the promise with the error object passed to the `fail` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("rejected"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error message, whereas the original code would reject the promise with the error object passed to the `fail` method.

DONE.
