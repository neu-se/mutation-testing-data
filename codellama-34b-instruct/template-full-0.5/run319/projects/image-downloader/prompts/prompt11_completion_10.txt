  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension of a path, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.relative
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.relative` returns the relative path between two paths, whereas `path.basename` returns the file name.

DONE.
