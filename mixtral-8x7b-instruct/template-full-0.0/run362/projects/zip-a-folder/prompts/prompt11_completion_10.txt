 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + src
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends './' to the `src` string, which might not be desirable in all cases. It could cause issues if the `src` is a glob pattern or if the path is expected to be relative to the current working directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src.trim()
