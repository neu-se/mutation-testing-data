  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefer the `other` iterator's insert operation, even if it is not the priority iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' || otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefer the `this` iterator's insert operation, even if it is not the priority iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always prefer the `other` iterator's insert operation, even if it is not the priority iterator.

DONE.
