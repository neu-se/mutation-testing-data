 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now treat `undefined` values as not being objects, whereas the original condition treated both `null` and `undefined` as not being objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b.toString() === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now only treat "real" objects (i.e., those created with `{}` or constructed with a class) as objects, whereas the original condition treated any value that is not `null` or `undefined` as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now treat `undefined` values as objects, whereas the original condition treated both `null` and `undefined` as not being objects.

DONE.
