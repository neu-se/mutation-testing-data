Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected input type from a Delta or number to a number incremented by 1, which would lead to incorrect transformations and potentially cause runtime errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the index calculation by multiplying the input by 2, which would incorrectly transform positions and lead to unexpected results in the Delta operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the index by 1, which could cause the transformation to skip over certain operations or incorrectly adjust the position, leading to data loss or corruption in the Delta.

DONE.
