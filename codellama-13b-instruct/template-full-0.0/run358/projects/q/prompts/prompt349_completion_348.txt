  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called. This would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with an error message indicating that the promise was rejected with a non-function value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and therefore cannot be called. This would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with an error message indicating that the promise was rejected with a non-function value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Promise was rejected with a non-function value"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function returns a rejected promise with the specified error message. This would cause the `rejected` callback to be called with the specified error message.

DONE.
