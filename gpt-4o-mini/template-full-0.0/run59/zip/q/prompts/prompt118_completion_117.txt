Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, value, index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index passed to the callback function, effectively skipping the first element of the array and causing the reduction to start from the second element instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value * 2, index
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value passed to the callback function by multiplying it by 2, which alters the outcome of the reduction operation, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, value, index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the index passed to the callback function to one less than the current index, which could lead to accessing an incorrect element in the array, resulting in unexpected behavior during the reduction process.

DONE.
