  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a function and needs to be called to return the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method of the `Function` prototype and needs to be called on a function to return the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` prototype and needs to be called on a function to return the expected value.

DONE.
