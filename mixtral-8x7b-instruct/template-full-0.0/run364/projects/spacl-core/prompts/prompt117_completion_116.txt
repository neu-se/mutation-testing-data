 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path) && verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the regex test method instead of the matches method, which checks for context-dependent paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.hasOwnProperty(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the verb property exists in the verbs object, instead of checking if the verb is a truthy value in the verbs object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path) && Object.keys(this.verbs).includes(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the verb is a key in the verbs object, instead of checking if the verb is a truthy value in the verbs object.

DONE.
