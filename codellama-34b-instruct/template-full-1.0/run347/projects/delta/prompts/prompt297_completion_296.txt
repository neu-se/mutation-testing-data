  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next().attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the attributes of the next operation instead of the attributes of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the attributes of the operation after the next one instead of the attributes of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.peek(1).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the attributes of the next operation instead of the attributes of the line.

DONE.
