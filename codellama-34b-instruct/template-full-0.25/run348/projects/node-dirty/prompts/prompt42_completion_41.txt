  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the string `"foo"` instead of the expected value.

DONE.
