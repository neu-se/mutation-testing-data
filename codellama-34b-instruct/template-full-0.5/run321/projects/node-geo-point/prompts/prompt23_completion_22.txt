  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the longitude property instead of the latitude property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'lat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a different property name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'long'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a different property name.

DONE.
