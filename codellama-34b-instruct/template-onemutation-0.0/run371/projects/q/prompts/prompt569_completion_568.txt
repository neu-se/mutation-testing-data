  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `errback` is a function that takes an error as an argument and returns a rejected promise. Using `reject` instead of `errback` would cause the error to be ignored, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the program.

DONE.
