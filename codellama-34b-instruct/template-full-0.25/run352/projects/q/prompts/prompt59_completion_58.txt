  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `window` is defined, while this replacement checks if it is not a function.

DONE.
