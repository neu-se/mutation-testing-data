Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length to be incremented by 1, potentially leading to incorrect operations being performed when composing the two deltas, as it would treat the length of the other operation as longer than it actually is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length by 1, which could lead to missing an operation or incorrectly processing the last part of the current operation, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the current operation, which could lead to an incorrect number of operations being processed, potentially causing an overflow of operations in the resulting delta.

DONE.
