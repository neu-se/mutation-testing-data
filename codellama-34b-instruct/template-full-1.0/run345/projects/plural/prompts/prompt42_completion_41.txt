  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length - 1` would return a different value than the original `0`, which would cause the `substr` method to start at a different index when creating the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `-1` would cause the `substr` method to start at a different index when creating the plural form of the word, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.length + 1` would return a different value than the original `0`, which would cause the `substr` method to start at a different index when creating the plural form of the word.

DONE.
