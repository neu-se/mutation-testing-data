Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of `b` instead of `a`, potentially missing attributes that are defined in `a` but not in `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key of Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the iteration method from a `for...in` loop (which iterates over all enumerable properties) to a `for...of` loop that only iterates over the keys returned by `Object.keys(a)`, which may not include inherited properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key in { ...a }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of `a` and iterates over the keys of that copy, which could lead to unexpected results if `a` is modified during the iteration or if `a` has properties that are not enumerable.

DONE.
