Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retArr = retArr.map(function (el) { return el; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing to the array, which may lead to unexpected results if the intention was to transform the elements of `urlMap` into a specific format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retArr = Array.from(urlMap.values()).slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the resulting array to only the first element of `urlMap`, potentially losing all other URLs that were intended to be included in the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retArr = Array.from(urlMap.values()).filter(el => el.url.includes('http'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the resulting array to only include URLs that contain 'http', which may exclude valid URLs that do not contain this substring, thus altering the intended output.

DONE.
