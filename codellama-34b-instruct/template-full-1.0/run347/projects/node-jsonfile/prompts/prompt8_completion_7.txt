  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stripped_bom"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called, and the resulting data would not have the BOM (Byte Order Mark) stripped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bom"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is being called with the incorrect argument, and the resulting data would be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stripBom` function is not being called at all, and the resulting data would not be modified.

DONE.
