  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of the `latitude` property instead of the `longitude` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of the `longitude` property with a value of `1` more than the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would be checking for the presence of the `longitude` property with a value that is twice the actual value.

DONE.
