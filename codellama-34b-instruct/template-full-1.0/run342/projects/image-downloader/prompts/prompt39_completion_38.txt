  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve()` is a method that resolves the current promise, whereas the original code fragment `resolve` is a reference to the `resolve` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject()` is a method that rejects the current promise, whereas the original code fragment `resolve` is a reference to the `resolve` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error()` throws an error, whereas the original code fragment `resolve` is a reference to the `resolve` method.

DONE.
