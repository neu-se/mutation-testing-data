Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the retain property of the other operation instead of the embedType, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the operation types during composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the insert property of the current operation instead of the embedType, which could lead to unexpected results when composing operations that should be based on the embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value instead of the expected embedType, which could cause the handler to fail or behave incorrectly when trying to compose the operations.

DONE.
