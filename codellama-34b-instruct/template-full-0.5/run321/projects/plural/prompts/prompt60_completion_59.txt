  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "criteria" which is plural, while the new code fragment is "criterion" which is singular.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "criteria" which is plural, while the new code fragment is "criterions" which is plural but not a valid word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is "criteria" which is plural, while the new code fragment is "criterium" which is singular but not a valid word.

DONE.
