  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but this code checks if it is a string. If `op.delete` is a number, this code would return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but this code checks if it is greater than 0. If `op.delete` is a number, this code would return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, but this code checks if it is defined. If `op.delete` is a number, this code would return a different value than the original code.
