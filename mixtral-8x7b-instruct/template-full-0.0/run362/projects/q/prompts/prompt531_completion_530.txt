 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method of the returned promise would now return `{ state: "fulfilled", value: null }` instead of an object with a `value` property matching the input argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method of the returned promise would now return `{ state: "fulfilled", value: <the value of the `this` object> }` instead of an object with a `value` property matching the input argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){return {}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method of the returned promise would now always return `{ state: "fulfilled", value: {} }` regardless of the input argument.

DONE.
