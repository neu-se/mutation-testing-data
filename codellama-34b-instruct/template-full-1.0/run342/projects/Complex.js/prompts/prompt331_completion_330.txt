  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `a`, causing the `if` statement to always execute the `true` branch, even if `a` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `a`, causing the `if` statement to always execute the `false` branch, even if `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `a`, causing the `if` statement to always execute the `true` branch, even if `a` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
