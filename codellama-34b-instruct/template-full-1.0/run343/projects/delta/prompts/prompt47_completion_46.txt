  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because `NULL_CHARACTER` is a string with length 1, whereas `a` is a string with length 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a string with length 1, whereas `a` is a string with length 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ab'
```
This would result in different behavior because `ab` is a string with length 2, whereas `a` is a string with length 0.

DONE.
