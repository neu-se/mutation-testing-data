  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be multiplying the imaginary part of the complex number with the number of places, instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the imaginary part of the complex number to the product of the real part and the number of places, instead of just multiplying the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be subtracting the imaginary part of the complex number from the product of the real part and the number of places, instead of just multiplying the real part.

DONE.
