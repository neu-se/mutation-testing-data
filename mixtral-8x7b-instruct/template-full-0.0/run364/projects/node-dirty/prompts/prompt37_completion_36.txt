 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all key-value pairs from the `_data` map, which is not the behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an iterator for the values of the `_data` map, instead of iterating over the key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.has(key) ? this._data.get(key) : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` if the key is not present in the `_data` map, instead of just returning `undefined` when the value is explicitly set to `undefined`.

DONE.
