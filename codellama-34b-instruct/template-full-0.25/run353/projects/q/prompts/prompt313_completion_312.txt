  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then` method, while `this.then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(this.then)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the value passed to it, while `this.then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(this.then)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the value passed to it, while `this.then` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved with the value returned by the `then
