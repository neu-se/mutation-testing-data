 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would always return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, instead of forwarding any unhandled errors from the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(new Error('Always rejected'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would always reject the promise with a new `Error` object, regardless of the original promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a resolved promise, but without the `done` method. Therefore, any unhandled errors from the original promise would not be forwarded.

DONE.
