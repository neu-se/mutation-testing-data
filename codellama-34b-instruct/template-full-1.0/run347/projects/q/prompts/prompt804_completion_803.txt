  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null", "null", progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first and second arguments from `void 0` to `"null"`, which are truthy values and will cause the `.then()` method to execute the success callback in both cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined", "undefined", progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first and second arguments from `void 0` to `"undefined"`, which are truthy values and will cause the `.then()` method to execute the success callback in both cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the quotes from the first and second arguments, which would cause the `.then()` method to execute the success callback only if the first argument is truthy, whereas the second argument would be treated as a string.

DONE.
