  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, making the `untrackRejection` function always run, regardless of whether the promise has been handled or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!trackUnhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, making the `untrackRejection` function never run, regardless of whether the promise has been handled or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections && unhandledRejections.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if there are unhandled rejections, making the `untrackRejection` function only run if there are unhandled rejections, regardless of whether the promise has been handled or not.

DONE.
