 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate one extra time when `i` is equal to `length`, potentially causing unintended side effects or errors in the `read` or `s` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other argument and potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `length` after each iteration, causing the loop to terminate prematurely and potentially leading to unintended side effects or errors in the `read` or `s` functions.

DONE.
