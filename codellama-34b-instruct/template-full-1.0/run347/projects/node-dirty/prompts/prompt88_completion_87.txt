  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift` method removes the first element of an array, while `pop` removes the last element. If the array has only one element, `shift` and `pop` will have the same effect, but if the array has multiple elements, `shift` will remove a different element than `pop`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let rowStr = arr.pop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element of an array, while `shift` removes the first element. If the array has only one element, `shift` and `pop` will have the same effect, but if the array has multiple elements, `pop` will remove a different element than `shift`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(1, 1);
