  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is the sum of `a` and `b`, while `a * b` is the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a - b` is the difference between `a` and `b`, while `a * b` is the product of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - a` is the difference between `b` and `a`, while `a * b` is the product of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
