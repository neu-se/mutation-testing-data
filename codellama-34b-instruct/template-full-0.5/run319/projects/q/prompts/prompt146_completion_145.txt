  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it is unlikely to be used in the same context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it is unlikely to be used in the same context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackTrace__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it is unlikely to be used in the same context.

DONE.
