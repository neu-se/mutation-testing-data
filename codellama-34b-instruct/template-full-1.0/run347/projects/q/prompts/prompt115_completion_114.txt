  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, while `value` is a variable that may hold any type of value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, while `value` is a variable that may hold any type of value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a string, while `value` is a variable that may hold any type of value.

DONE.
