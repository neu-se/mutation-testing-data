  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the promises array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reversed version of the promises array instead of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the promises array starting from the second element instead of the original array.

DONE.
