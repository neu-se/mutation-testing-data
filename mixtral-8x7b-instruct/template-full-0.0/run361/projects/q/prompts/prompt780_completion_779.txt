 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return {};
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would be called on an empty object instead of the promise's state, causing incorrect or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return Q.resolve();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` is immediately fulfilled, causing the `all` method to resolve prematurely and not wait for the original promises to settle. This may lead to incorrect or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
    return Q.reject(new Error('Artificial rejection'));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates an artificial rejection, causing the `all` method to reject prematurely and not wait for the original promises to settle. This may lead to incorrect or unexpected results
