Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, null]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the property to `null` instead of the intended `value`, potentially leading to loss of data or unexpected behavior when the property is accessed later.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to get the value of the property instead of setting it, which would not modify the object as intended and could lead to confusion or errors in the program's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the property to its own key name instead of the intended `value`, which could lead to incorrect data being stored in the object.

DONE.
