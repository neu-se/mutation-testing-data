  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has a higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the expression `atReport, 1` would be evaluated as `(atReport, 1) + 1`, which would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `atReport, 1` would be evaluated as `atReport - 1, 1`, which would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `atReport, 1` would be evaluated as `atReport * 1, 1`, which would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
