  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not defined on the `this` object, which is a promise. The `fail` method is only defined on the `Promise` prototype, and it is not inherited by the `this` object. Therefore, this code fragment would result in a `TypeError` because `this.fapply` would return a promise that does not have a `fail` method.

DONE.
