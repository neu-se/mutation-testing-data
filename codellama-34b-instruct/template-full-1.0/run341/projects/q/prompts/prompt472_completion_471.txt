  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of an array, while `splice()` removes the element at a specific index, which may be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of an array, while `splice()` removes the element at a specific index, which may be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.splice(atReport, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes 10 elements starting from `atReport`, while `splice()` removes one element at `atReport`.

DONE.
