  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path from the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the pathname from the current URL instead of the path from the base URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the pathname from the base URL instead of the current URL, which could lead to incorrect parsing results.

DONE.
