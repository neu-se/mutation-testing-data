  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while the new code fragment `abort === true ? null : abort` is a ternary expression that evaluates to `null` if `abort` is `true`, and `abort` itself if it is `false`. This change would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a different argument, potentially leading to different behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
