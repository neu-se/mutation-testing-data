  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the starting condition would be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one additional time, as the starting condition would be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one additional time, as the starting condition would be true.

DONE.
