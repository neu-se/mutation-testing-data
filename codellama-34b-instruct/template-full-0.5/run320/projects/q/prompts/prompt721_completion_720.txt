  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with the original `promises` array, instead of resolving it with the array of resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(array_slice(promises, 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with a slice of the `promises` array, starting from the second element, instead of resolving it with the array of resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(array_map(promises, function (promise) { return promise.inspect().value; }));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the deferred promise with an array of the resolved values of the promises in the `promises` array, instead of resolving it with the array of resolved values.

DONE.
