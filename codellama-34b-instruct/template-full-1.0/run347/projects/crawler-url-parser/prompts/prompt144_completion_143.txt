  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:\/|[^\/])index\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|` character in the regular expression matches either a forward slash (`/`) or any character other than a forward slash, which means that the regular expression would match a URL that contains the pattern `/index.abc` followed by any character other than a forward slash. In the original code, the regular expression only matches a URL that contains the pattern `/index.abc` followed by a forward slash, which means that the `replace` method would not be called if the URL does not contain the pattern `/index.abc` followed by a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(?:^index|index\.[a-z]+)$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches a URL that contains the pattern `index` at the beginning of the URL or at the end of the URL, followed by any sequence of one or more letters followed by a dot and one or more letters,
