  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex to match multiple times in a string, rather than just once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex to match case-insensitively, meaning that the pattern would match both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `m` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex to match
