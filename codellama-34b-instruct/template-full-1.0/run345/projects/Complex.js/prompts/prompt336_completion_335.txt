  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the logarithm to return 0, instead of the expected result of -Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the logarithm to return a negative value, instead of the expected result of Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
complex(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of 1, instead of the expected result of a complex number with a real part of 0 and an imaginary part of Infinity.

DONE.
