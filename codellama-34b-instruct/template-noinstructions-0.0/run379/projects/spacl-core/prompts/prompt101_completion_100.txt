  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for any value of `verb`, regardless of whether the policy allows the action or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb" + "random"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for any value of `verb`, regardless of whether the policy allows the action or not, and would also introduce a random element to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"verb" + "invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would always return `true` for any value of `verb`, regardless of whether the policy allows the action or not, and would also introduce an invalid value to the result.

DONE.
