  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the value of the `arg` variable by 1, which could cause the resulting `Delta` object to have a different length or content compared to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority, arg
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the order of the arguments passed to the `transform` function, which could cause a different result depending on the implementation of the function and the values of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority & arg
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a bitwise AND operation on the `priority` and `arg` variables, which could result in a different value being returned from the `transform` function.

DONE.
