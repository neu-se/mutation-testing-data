 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event is not emitted, and the error message is printed to the console instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error event is not emitted, and no callback is invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.emit('something_else')
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'something\_else' event is emitted instead of the 'error' event.

DONE.
