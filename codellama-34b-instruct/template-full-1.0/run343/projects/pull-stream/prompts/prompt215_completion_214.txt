  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is being invoked with a different argument than what it is defined to be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (aborted) cb(aborted)
else cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic of the function and would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
