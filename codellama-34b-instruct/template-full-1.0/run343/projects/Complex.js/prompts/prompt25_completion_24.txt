  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cube of `b` instead of the square.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a` and `b` instead of the sum.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + b * b * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a factor of Ï€ to the square of `b`, making the expression much larger.

DONE.
