Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes == null || typeof attributes !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp.attributes` to be set to `undefined` or any non-object type, which would bypass the original check for valid attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && typeof attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp.attributes` to be set even when `attributes` is an empty object, contrary to the original intent of requiring at least one key in the attributes object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null && typeof attributes === 'object' && Object.keys(attributes).length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `Object.keys(attributes).length < 0` is always false, meaning that `newOp.attributes` would never be set, regardless of the actual content of `attributes`.

DONE.
