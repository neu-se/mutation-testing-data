  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.resume();
```
This would result in different behavior because `res.resume()` is a method that can be called on a readable stream to start the flow of data, while `res.resume` is a property that indicates whether the stream has been paused or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest + '1'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the response data to a different file than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' }));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write the response data to the file with a different encoding than the original code.

DONE.
