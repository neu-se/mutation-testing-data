 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk and has different behavior than the original `JSON.parse`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Function` can also execute arbitrary code, which is a security risk and has different behavior than the original `JSON.parse`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('json-parse-even-better-errors').parse
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `json-parse-even-better-errors` package, which provides more informative error messages than the original `JSON.parse`. This could potentially cause tests to fail if they are relying on specific error messages from `JSON.parse`.

DONE.
