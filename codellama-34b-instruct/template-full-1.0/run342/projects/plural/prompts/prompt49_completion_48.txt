  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because `quy` is not a valid match, and the rule would not be applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the match would now include words that end with `y`, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]x$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the match would now include words that end with `x`, which is not intended.

DONE.
