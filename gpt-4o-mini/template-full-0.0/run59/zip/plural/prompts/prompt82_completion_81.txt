Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/mouse$/, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly defines the pluralization rule for "mouse" to return "mouses" instead of the correct "mice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/mouse$/, 'mouses')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the plural of "mouse" to a static string "mouses" instead of using a function to handle the pluralization, which would not account for any other logic that might be needed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/mouse$/, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly applies the pluralization rule to "mouse" by appending "es", resulting in "mousees" instead of the correct "mice".

DONE.
