  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) + ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because a space is added to the end of the parsed float string, which would cause the string to be parsed as NaN (Not a Number) instead of a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) + ' ' + 'Cancel'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string 'Cancel' is added to the end of the parsed float string, which would cause the string to be parsed as NaN (Not a Number) instead of a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) + ' ' + i
```
This would result in different behavior because the current iteration index i is added to the end of the parsed float string, which would cause the string to be parsed as NaN (Not a Number) instead of a valid number.
