  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `done` callback with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment calls it with both `null` and `end` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `done` callback with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment calls it without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `done` callback with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment calls it with both `null` and `end` arguments.

DONE.
