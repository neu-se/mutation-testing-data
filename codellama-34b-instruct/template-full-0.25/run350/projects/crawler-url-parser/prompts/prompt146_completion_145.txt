  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the match with an empty string, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the forward slash being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the match with a space, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the forward slash being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the match with a forward slash, while this new code fragment replaces the match with a backslash, which could potentially cause issues if the code
