 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\..+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that follows "\/index\." instead of only matching lowercase alphabets.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[A-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that follows "\/index\." with one or more uppercase alphabets only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-zA-Z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that follows "\/index\." with one or more alphabets (either lowercase or uppercase).

DONE.
