  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so the `onRejected` function would never be called, even if the promise is rejected. This would cause the `allResolved` function to never reject, even if all promises are rejected, which is not the intended behavior.
