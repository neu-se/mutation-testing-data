  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because "set" is a valid method on the `Promise` prototype, while "delete" is not. Using "set" would cause the `Q.del` method to perform a property set instead of a property delete, which could lead to unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unset"
```
This would result in different behavior because "unset" is not a valid method on the `Promise` prototype. Using "unset" would cause an error to be thrown, which could be caught by the test suite and reported as a failure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because "false" is not a valid method on the `Promise` prototype. Using "false" would cause an error to be thrown, which could be caught by the test suite and reported as a failure.

DONE.
