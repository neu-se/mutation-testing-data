  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `zipAFolderOptions` object exists and the `customWriteStream` property does not exist or is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is truthy, while this replacement checks if the `customWriteStream` property exists and is not null.
