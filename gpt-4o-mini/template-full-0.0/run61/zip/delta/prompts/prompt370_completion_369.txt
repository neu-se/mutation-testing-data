Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of retaining the current operation, it pushes the next operation from `thisIter` into `delta`, which could lead to incorrect state changes in the `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains zero characters, effectively discarding any relevant data that should have been retained, which could lead to loss of information in the transformation process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(thisIter.peekLength() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it retains one more character than intended, potentially causing an overflow in the retained data and leading to incorrect transformations in the `Delta` object.

DONE.
