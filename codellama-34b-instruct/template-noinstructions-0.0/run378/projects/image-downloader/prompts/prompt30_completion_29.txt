  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight` removes characters from the end of the string, while `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first character of the string, while `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` removes the `http` or `https` protocol from the beginning of the string, while `trimLeft` removes characters from the beginning of the string.

DONE.
