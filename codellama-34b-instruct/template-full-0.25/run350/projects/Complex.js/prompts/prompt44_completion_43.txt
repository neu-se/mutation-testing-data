  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the condition would evaluate to `true` even if `b` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly checks for both `undefined` and `null`, which would catch cases where `b` is not defined or is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` is defined by checking its type, which would catch cases where `b` is not defined or is `null`.

DONE.
