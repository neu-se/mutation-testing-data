  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the letter "e" to replace the "y" in words that end in "y", while the new code fragment uses the letter "a". This would result in incorrect pluralization for words that end in "y".
