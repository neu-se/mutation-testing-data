  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would not be called, and the `parsedUrl` variable would not be set, leading to different values being used in the subsequent code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with a null value, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` function would be called with an undefined value, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
