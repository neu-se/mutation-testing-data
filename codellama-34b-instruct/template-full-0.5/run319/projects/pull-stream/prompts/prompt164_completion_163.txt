  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the function would return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` even if `abort` is false, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first truthy value, so if `abort` is false, the function would return `true` instead of `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `abort` is false, the function would return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)` instead of `cb(true)`.

DONE.
