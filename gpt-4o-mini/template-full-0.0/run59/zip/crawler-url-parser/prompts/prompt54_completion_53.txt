Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(currentUrlStr, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` combines the current URL and the base URL to create an absolute URL, which may not preserve the original URL's structure and parameters as `URL.format` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating the two strings directly would not produce a valid URL format, potentially leading to incorrect URL parsing and resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr).href
```
This would result in different behavior because using `.href` would return the full URL as a string, but it may not include all the components (like query parameters) in the same way that `URL.format` does, leading to loss of information.

DONE.
