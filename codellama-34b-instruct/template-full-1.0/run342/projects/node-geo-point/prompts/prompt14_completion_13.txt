  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isTuple
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isTuple` checks if an array is a tuple, which is not the same as checking if it's an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.isArray` is a function that checks if an object is an array, but it's not necessarily the same as `Array.isArray`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Array.isArray` would check the opposite of what `Array.isArray` checks, which could lead to different behavior in the code.

DONE.
