  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `rest` except the first one, whereas `rest` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(2)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `rest` except the first two, whereas `rest` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rest.slice(3)` would return a new array containing all the elements of `rest` except the first three, whereas `rest` would return the original array.

DONE.
