  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `attempt1` is not `undefined`, even if `attempt1[1]` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `attempt1` is not `null`, even if `attempt1[1]` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `attempt1` is not `NaN`, even if `attempt1[1]` is `NaN`.

DONE.
