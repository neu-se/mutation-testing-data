  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concatedStacks.split("\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to split a string instead of a concatenated stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.join("\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to join an array of stack traces instead of a concatenated stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.join("\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be trying to join an array of filtered stack traces instead of a concatenated stack trace.

DONE.
