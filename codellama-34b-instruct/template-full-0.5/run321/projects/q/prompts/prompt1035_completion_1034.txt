  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(null, deferred.reject);

This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, but the first argument is `null`, which means that the `onFulfilled` callback is not provided, so the promise will not be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function() {

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.promise.then(function() {
    deferred.resolve();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is
