 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && <PLACEHOLDER>(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrl` is truthy and then calls a function/operator on `currentUrlStr` instead of checking if `currentUrlStr` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `currentUrl` is truthy and then calls `_has_illegal_chars` on `baseUrlStr` instead of checking if `currentUrlStr` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrl && !_has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
