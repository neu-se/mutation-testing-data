  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has a next value, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` is a property that refers to the iterator's `hasNext` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` is a function that returns the next value in the iterator, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` is a property that refers to the iterator's `hasNext` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peek()` is a function that returns the next value in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `otherIter.hasNext` is a property that refers to the iterator's `hasNext` method.

DONE.
