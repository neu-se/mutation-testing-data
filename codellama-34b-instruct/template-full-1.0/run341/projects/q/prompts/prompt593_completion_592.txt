  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `.call` is used to invoke a function with a specific `this` value and an argument list, while `.apply` is used to invoke a function with a specific `this` value and the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind` creates a new function that, when called, will call the original function with a specific `this` value and zero or more arguments that are passed to the bind function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.yield
```
This would result in different behavior because `.yield` is used in generators to yield a value to the generator's internal coroutine.

DONE.
