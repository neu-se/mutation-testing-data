  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `b` are different objects, and `Object.keys(a)` would return the keys of `a`, while `Object.keys(b)` would return the keys of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` would return the value of the property `key` in the object `b`, while `b` would return the object `b` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key]` would return the value of the property `key` in the object `a`, while `a` would return the object `a` itself.

DONE.
