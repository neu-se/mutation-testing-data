  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire arguments object to the `nodeArgs` array, rather than just the first two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to the `nodeArgs` array, rather than the first two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the second argument to the `nodeArgs` array, rather than the first two arguments.

DONE.
