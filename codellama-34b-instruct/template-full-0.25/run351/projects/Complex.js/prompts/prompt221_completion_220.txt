  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be applied to the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to the imaginary part of the complex number plus one instead of the imaginary part alone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of the imaginary part alone.

DONE.
