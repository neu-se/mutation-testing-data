  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is null. If `options.dest` is null, the original code fragment would still consider it as a valid value, while this new code fragment would reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is undefined. If `options.dest` is undefined, the original code fragment would still consider it as a valid value, while this new code fragment would reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks
