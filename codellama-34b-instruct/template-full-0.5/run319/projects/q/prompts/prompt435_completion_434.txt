  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== undefined && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object, but this replacement checks if `process` is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit !== undefined && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process.emit` is a function, but this replacement checks if `process.emit` is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process.emit` is a function, but this replacement checks if it is an object.

DONE.
