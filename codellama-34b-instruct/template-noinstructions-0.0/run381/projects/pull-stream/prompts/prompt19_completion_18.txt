  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[2]` instead of `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument passed to the `pull` function would be `ref[3]` instead of `ref[0]`.

DONE.
