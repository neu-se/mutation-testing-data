  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object would be undefined, which would cause the `stringify` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return `null` instead of a string, which would cause the `writeFile` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would return an empty object instead of a string, which would cause the `writeFile` function to throw an error.

DONE.
