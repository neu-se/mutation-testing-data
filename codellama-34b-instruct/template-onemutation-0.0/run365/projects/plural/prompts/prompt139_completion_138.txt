  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `word` variable as-is, while the modified code fragment converts the `word` variable to lowercase before using it. This could cause the pluralization rules to be applied incorrectly, leading to incorrect plural forms.
