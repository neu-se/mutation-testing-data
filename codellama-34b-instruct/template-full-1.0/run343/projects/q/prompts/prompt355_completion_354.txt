  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newException.message = "Different error message";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of the error is being modified, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting the new message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be returned instead of the expected error, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(newException);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved with the error, which could cause the test to fail if it is not expecting the rejection.

DONE.
