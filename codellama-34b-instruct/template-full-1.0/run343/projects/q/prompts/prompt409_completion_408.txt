  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator (`!`) would invert the truthiness of the `value` expression, causing the `when` function to receive the opposite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * value
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator (`*`) would double the value of `value`, causing the `when` function to receive a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator (`+`) would add 1 to the value of `value`, causing the `when` function to receive a different value.

DONE.
