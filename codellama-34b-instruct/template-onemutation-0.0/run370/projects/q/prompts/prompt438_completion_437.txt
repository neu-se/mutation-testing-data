  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code uses the original array. This could cause the `array_indexOf()` function to return a different index, leading to different behavior in the `trackRejection()` and `untrackRejection()` functions.
