  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator before `this.hasNext()` would cause the resulting `true` or `false` value to be negated, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.peek().hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the index, so it may return a different result than `hasNext()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext() && this.peekType() !== 'delete'`
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for the `peekType()` would cause the `false` result to be returned if the next operation is a delete, which is not handled correctly in the original code.

DONE.
