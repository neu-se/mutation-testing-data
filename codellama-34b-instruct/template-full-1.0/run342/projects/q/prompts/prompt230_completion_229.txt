  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op !== "when" && operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` value would not be checked for equality with the string "when", and the `operands` array would be indexed by 1 regardless of the `op` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` value would be checked for equality with the string "when", but the `operands` array would be indexed by 2, which is a different element than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` value would be checked for equality with the string "when", but the `operands` array would be indexed by 0, which is a different element than the original code.

DONE.
