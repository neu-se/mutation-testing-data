  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseUrlStr` variable to be set to the value of the `href` attribute of the `<base>` element, rather than the value of the `data` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseUrlStr` variable to be set to the value of the `href` attribute of the `<base>` element, followed by a forward slash, rather than the value of the `data` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href') + '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseUrlStr` variable to be set to the value of the `href` attribute of the `<base>` element, followed by a question mark, rather than the value of the `data` parameter
