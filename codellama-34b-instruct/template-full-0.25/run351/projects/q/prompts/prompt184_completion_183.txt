  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a function that converts its argument to a number, while the replacement code fragment `"0"` is a string that always evaluates to the number 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a function that converts its argument to a number, while the replacement code fragment `null` is a null value that does not have a number conversion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` is a function that converts its argument to a number, while the replacement code fragment `undefined` is an undefined value that does not have a number conversion.

DONE.
