  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!\/)\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor asserts the start of the string, and the `(?!\/)` negative lookahead checks that the next character is not a `\`, which means the pattern no longer matches URLs that start with `//`, which is invalid.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\w/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\w` metacharacter matches any word character (alphanumeric and underscore), which means the pattern no longer matches URLs that start with a protocol, which is invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\w/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\w` metacharacter matches any word character (alphanumeric and underscore), and the `^` anchor asserts the start of the string, which means the pattern no longer matches URLs that start with a protocol, which is invalid.
