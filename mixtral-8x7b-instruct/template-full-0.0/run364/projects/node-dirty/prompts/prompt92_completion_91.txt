 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Corrupted row at the end of the file'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the same error message, regardless of the contents of the row. The original code fragment checks if the row is empty or corrupted, and returns an error message accordingly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an error object with an empty message. The original code fragment creates an error object with a specific message, which can be useful for debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a null value instead of an error object. The original code fragment is designed to return an error object if the row is corrupted, so returning a null value would not provide the same information to the developer.

DONE.
