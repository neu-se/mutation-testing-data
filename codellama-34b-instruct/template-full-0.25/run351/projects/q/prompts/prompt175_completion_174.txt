  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would cause the order of the elements in the `desiredLines` array to be reversed before they are joined, which would produce a different output than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method would return a new array containing all elements of `desiredLines` except the first one, which would cause the `join()` method to be called on a different array than in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["extra line"]).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method would add an extra element to the `desiredLines` array, which would cause the `join()` method to be called on a different array than in the original code.

DONE.
