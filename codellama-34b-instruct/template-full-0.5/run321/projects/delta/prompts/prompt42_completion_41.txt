  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCodePoint
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCodePoint` expects a Unicode code point, whereas `String.fromCharCode` expects a character code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(0)` would return the string "\0", whereas `String.fromCharCode` with any other argument would return a string with a different character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.fromCharCode(1)` would return the string "1", whereas `String.fromCharCode` with any other argument would return a string with a different character.

DONE.
