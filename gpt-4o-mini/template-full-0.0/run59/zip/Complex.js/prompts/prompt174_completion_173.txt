Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly treat cases where the imaginary part of the divisor is positive as if it were real, potentially leading to incorrect division results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the division to proceed even when the imaginary part is zero, which could lead to division by zero errors or incorrect results when the divisor is purely real.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the real part of the divisor instead of the imaginary part, leading to incorrect handling of cases where the divisor is purely imaginary.

DONE.
