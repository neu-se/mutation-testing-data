  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This change will cause the `any` function to always resolve, even if all promises are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This change will cause the `any` function to always notify, even if all promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("Error message")
```
This change will cause the `any` function to always reject with a specific error message, even if all promises are resolved.

DONE.
