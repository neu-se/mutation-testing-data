  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `flushing` is false, while this modified code fragment always evaluates to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `flushing` is true, while this modified code fragment always evaluates to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `flushing` is true, while this modified code fragment always evaluates to the opposite of `flushing`.

DONE.
