 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.apply(obj).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is used instead of `call`, changing the way arguments are passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(null).slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the argument instead of `obj`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(123).slice(8, -1)
