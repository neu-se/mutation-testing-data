  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the URL from "http" to "https", which could potentially cause the URL to be treated as a different URL by the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could potentially cause the URL to be treated as a different URL by the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace("stackoverflow.com", "stackexchange.com")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the domain of the URL from "stackoverflow.com" to "stackexchange.com", which could potentially cause the URL to be treated as a different URL by the code.

DONE.
