  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would now return a tuple containing the specified property and its value, rather than just the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"property"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would now return a string indicating the specified property, rather than its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would now return null, rather than its value.

DONE.
