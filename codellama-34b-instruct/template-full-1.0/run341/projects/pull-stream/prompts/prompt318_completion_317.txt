  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function, but this changed code does not call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function, but this changed code passes `undefined` as an argument to the function, which may cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls the `cb` function with a specific argument, but this changed code calls the function with a random number, which may cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
