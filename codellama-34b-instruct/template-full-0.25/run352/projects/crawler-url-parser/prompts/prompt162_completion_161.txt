  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 1, while this code checks for greater than 1. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have more than one path part beyond the base URL, rather than just links that have exactly one path part beyond the base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff >= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 1, while this code checks for greater than or equal to 1. This would cause the function to return "sublevel" for links that have at least one path part beyond the base URL, rather than just links that have exactly one path part beyond the base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for equality with 1, while this code checks
