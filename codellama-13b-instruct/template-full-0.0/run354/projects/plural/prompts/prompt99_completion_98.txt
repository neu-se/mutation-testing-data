  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match any character, regardless of its case, whereas the original code fragment only matches the letter "a".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match all occurrences of the letter "a", whereas the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regular expression would cause it to match the letter "a" only if it is followed by a word boundary, whereas the original code fragment matches any occurrence of the letter "a".

DONE.
