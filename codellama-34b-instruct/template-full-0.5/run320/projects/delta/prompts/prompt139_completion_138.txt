  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` to be evaluated instead of `thisIter`, which could lead to a different interpretation of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to be called on `thisIter` instead of `peekType`, which could lead to a different interpretation of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `peekLength` method to be called on `otherIter` instead of `peekType`, which could lead to a different interpretation of the code.

DONE.
