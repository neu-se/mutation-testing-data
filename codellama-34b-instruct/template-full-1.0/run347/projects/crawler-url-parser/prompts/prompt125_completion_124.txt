  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!linkurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original check, allowing the code to proceed even if `linkurl` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `linkurl` is null or undefined, allowing the code to proceed even if `linkurl` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof linkurl != "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `linkurl` is not a string, allowing the code to proceed even if `linkurl` is a different type.

DONE.
