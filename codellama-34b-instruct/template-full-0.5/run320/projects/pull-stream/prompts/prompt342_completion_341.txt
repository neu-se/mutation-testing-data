  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would flip the value of `abort` to its opposite. If `abort` is true, `!abort` would be false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `abort`, which could change the behavior of the function if it is being used as a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `abort` to false, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
