  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would pass the reason for the rejection to the `rejected` callback, while the new code fragment `null` would pass `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would pass the reason for the rejection to the `rejected` callback, while the new code fragment `undefined` would pass `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `reason` would pass the reason for the rejection to the `rejected` callback, while the new code fragment `"error"` would pass the string `"error"` instead.

DONE.
