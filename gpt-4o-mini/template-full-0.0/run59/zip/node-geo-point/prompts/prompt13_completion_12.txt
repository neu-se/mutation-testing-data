Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow non-array inputs with exactly two elements to pass validation, while the original code checks for an array and ensures it has exactly two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray(point.coordinates) && point.coordinates.length === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the validation to pass if `point.coordinates` is not an array but has a length of 2, which contradicts the original requirement that it must be an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate if `point.coordinates` is an array or if it does not have exactly two elements, allowing both invalid cases to pass.

DONE.
