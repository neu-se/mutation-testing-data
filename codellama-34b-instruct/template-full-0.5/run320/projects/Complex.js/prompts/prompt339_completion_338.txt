  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return `true` if either `a` or `b` is equal to zero, whereas the original code fragment using `&&` would only return `true` if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator would return `true` if `b` is not equal to zero, whereas the original code fragment using `&&` would only return `true` if both `a` and `b` are equal to zero.
