  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for read access, not write access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for write access, not read access.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check for the existence of the file, not read or write access.

DONE.
