Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the function used to calculate the denominator from cosine to sine, which will affect the output of the `tanh` function, potentially leading to incorrect results for complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the input to the cosine function by adding 1 to `b`, which will produce a different value than the original `Math.cos(b)` and could lead to unexpected results in the calculation of the `tanh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the cosine function with the hyperbolic cosine function, which has a different mathematical definition and will yield different results in the context of the `tanh` calculation.

DONE.
