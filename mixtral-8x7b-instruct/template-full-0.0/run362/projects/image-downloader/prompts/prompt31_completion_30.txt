 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'url' string ends with 's' instead of checking if it starts with 'https'. This could cause the wrong protocol (http or https) to be used, leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.protocol
