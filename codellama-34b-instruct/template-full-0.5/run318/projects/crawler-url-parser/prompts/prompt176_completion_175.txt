  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.href` is a read-only property that returns the entire URL, including the protocol and domain, while `url` is a writable property that can be set to any string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.protocol` is a read-only property that returns the protocol of the URL, while `url` is a writable property that can be set to any string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.pathname` is a read-only property that returns the path of the URL, while `url` is a writable property that can be set to any string value.

DONE.
