  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$|/
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `|` character changes the semantics of the regular expression, making it match either the original or an empty string instead of just the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `g` flag makes the regular expression become global, which is not the intended behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `i` flag makes the regular expression case-insensitive, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
