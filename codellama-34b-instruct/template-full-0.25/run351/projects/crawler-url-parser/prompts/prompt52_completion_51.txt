  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the path of the parsed URL instead of the full URL, which could lead to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the hostname of the parsed URL instead of the full URL, which could lead to different results in the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol + '://' + parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the protocol and host of the parsed URL instead of the full URL, which could lead to different results in the `parse` function.

DONE.
