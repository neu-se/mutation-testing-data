  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isExternalFrame` checks if the frame is external to the current function, while `isInternalFrame` checks if the frame is internal to the current function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNodeFrame` checks if the frame is a Node.js frame, while `isInternalFrame` checks if the frame is internal to the current function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInternalFrame || isExternalFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the frame is internal to the current function or external to the current function, while `isInternalFrame` only checks if the frame is internal to the current function.

DONE.
