  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of a function, which would affect the program's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new function instead of a function from the `Array.prototype`, which would affect the program's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a function that would return the same value as the original function, but with a different name, which would affect the program's execution.

DONE.
