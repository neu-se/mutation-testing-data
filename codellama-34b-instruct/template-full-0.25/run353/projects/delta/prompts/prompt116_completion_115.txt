  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum + curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return a different value, as the new function would sum up the elements of the array instead of returning the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum * curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return a different value, as the new function would multiply the elements of the array instead of returning the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(accum, curr, index) => accum - curr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method would return a different value, as the new function would subtract the elements of the array instead of returning the last element.

DONE.
