 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of using the `op` variable, which could cause the `predicate` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `op` variable with `null`, which could cause the `predicate` function to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `op` variable with a random number, which would cause the `predicate` function to behave unexpectedly or even throw an error.

DONE.
