  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the length of the tokens array as a valid index, which would cause the loop to iterate one extra time. This would lead to an incorrect calculation of the complex number's sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last element of the tokens array, which could be an 'I' or 'i' that is part of the complex number's sign.missing 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < Math.min(tokens.length, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would limit the loop to a maximum of 10 iterations, which could cause the calculation to be incomplete if the complex number has more than 10 parts.

DONE.
