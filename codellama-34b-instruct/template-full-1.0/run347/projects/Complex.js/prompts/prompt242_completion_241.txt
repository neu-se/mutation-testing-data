  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is used instead of the real part, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number is increased by 1, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is decreased by 1, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
