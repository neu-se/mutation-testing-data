  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getAllTimezones` function would return an object with a single key-value pair, where the key is `null` and the value is the result of the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getAllTimezones` function would return an object with a single key-value pair, where the key is `undefined` and the value is the result of the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getAllTimezones` function would return an empty object, whereas the original code fragment returns an object with a single key-value pair.

DONE.
