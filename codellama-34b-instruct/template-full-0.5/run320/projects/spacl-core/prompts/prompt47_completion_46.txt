  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:.+?/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` makes the `+` quantifier non-greedy, meaning it will match as few characters as possible, rather than as many as possible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the negated character class `[^/]` matches any character that is not a forward slash, whereas the `.` matches any character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/:[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` matches any alphanumeric character, underscore, or hyphen, whereas the `.` matches any character.

DONE.
