  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if the `done` function is falsy, while the replacement code fragment uses the identity operator (===) to check if the `done` function is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if the `done` function is falsy, while the replacement code fragment uses the inequality operator (!=) to check if the `done` function is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof done !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator (!) to check if the `done` function is falsy, while the replacement code fragment uses the `typeof` operator to check if the `done` function is not a function.

DONE.
