 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it decrements the loop counter instead of incrementing it, causing the loop to iterate in reverse order or not terminate if the initial value of i is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always increments the loop counter by 1, skipping every other element in the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the length variable, causing the loop to iterate beyond the end of the arguments array and potentially causing an "index out of bounds" error.

DONE.
