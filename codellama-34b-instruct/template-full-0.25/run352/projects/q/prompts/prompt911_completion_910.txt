  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a mutator method that modifies the original array, whereas `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a new array by extracting a section of the original array, whereas `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` is a mutator method that changes the content of the original array by removing or replacing existing elements, whereas `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays.

DONE.
