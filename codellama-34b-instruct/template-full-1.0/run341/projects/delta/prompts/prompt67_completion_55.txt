  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push.apply(this, [newOp]);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.push` is a method, but `this.push.apply` would result in the `apply` method being called on the `push` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push.call(this, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.push.call` would result in the `call` method being called on the `push` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.push.bind(this, newOp)();
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.push.bind` would result in a bound function being created, which when called would push `newOp` onto the `ops` array.

DONE.
