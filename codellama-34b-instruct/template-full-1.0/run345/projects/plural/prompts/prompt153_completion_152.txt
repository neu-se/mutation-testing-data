  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world!", num
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a weakness in the regular expression function that would result in a Type error which the test apparently checks for and a new bug will not be detected until the next code changes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a", num + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a weakness in the of function that would result in the third argument of the function to be called with num + 10 instaed of num.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"b", num - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a weakness in the if statement that would result in the third argument of the function to be called with num - 10 instead of num.

DONE.
