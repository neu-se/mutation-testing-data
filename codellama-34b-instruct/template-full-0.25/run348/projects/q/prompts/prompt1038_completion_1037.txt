  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.defer()` to create a new promise, while this code fragment uses `Q.defer().promise` to create a new promise and immediately resolve it. This could cause the `put` method to resolve the promise immediately, rather than waiting for the `get` method to retrieve the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Q.defer()` to create a new promise, while this code fragment uses `Q.defer().promise.then(function() {})` to create a new promise and immediately resolve it with a value of `undefined`. This could cause the `put` method to resolve the promise immediately with a value of `undefined`, rather than waiting for the `get` method to retrieve the value.
