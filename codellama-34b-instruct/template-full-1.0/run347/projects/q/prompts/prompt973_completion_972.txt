  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.npost.apply(void 0, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.npost` is a different function from `Q`, although both are used for Node-style callbacks and promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.ninvoke
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.ninvoke` is a different function from `Q`, although both are used for Node-style callbacks and promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind(Q.npost, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is a different function from `Q`, although both are used for Node-style callbacks and promises.

DONE.
