  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will return a different array, with the first element of the array being the `name` argument, instead of the `name` argument and the second element being the result of the `array_slice` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function will return a different array, with the first element of the array being the `name` argument, instead of the `name` argument and the second element being the result of the `array_slice` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
