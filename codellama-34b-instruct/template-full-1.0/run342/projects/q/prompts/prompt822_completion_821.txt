  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ }
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, which is truthy, whereas `object` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is falsy, whereas `object` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is falsy, whereas `object` is truthy.

DONE.
