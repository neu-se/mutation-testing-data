  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the base raised to the power of the exponent. In this case, the base is 10 and the exponent is `places || 0`, which means that the result will be 10 raised to the power of `places` if `places` is not 0, and 10 raised to the power of 0 if `places` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(10, places || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function takes two arguments, the base and the exponent, and returns the base raised to the power of the exponent. In this case, the base is 10 and the exponent is `places || 1`, which means that the result will be 10 raised to the power of `places
