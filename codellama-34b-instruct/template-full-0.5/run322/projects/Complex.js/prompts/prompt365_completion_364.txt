  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not the same. While `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not the same. While `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, `tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not the same. While `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, `coth` returns the hyperbolic cotangent.

DONE.
