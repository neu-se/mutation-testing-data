  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!policy.matches
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the boolean not operator, which inverts the result of the `matches()` method, causing the `matches()` method to always return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `matches` property of the `policy` object to `false`, which would cause the `matches()` method to always return `false`, regardless of the actual match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `matches()` method with two different arguments, `path` and `ctx`, instead of the single argument `path` that the original code uses. This would cause the `matches()` method to be called with different arguments, which could potentially return a different result.

DONE.
