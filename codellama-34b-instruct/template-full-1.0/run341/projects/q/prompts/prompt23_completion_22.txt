  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.b()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.b()` is not a function, whereas `domain.enter()` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, whereas `domain.enter()` is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw Error` throws an error, whereas `domain.enter()` does not.

DONE.
