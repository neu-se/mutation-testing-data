  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, while `includes()` returns a boolean indicating whether the specified value exists in the string. Replacing `includes()` with `indexOf()` would cause the code to always return `true` for the `sublevel` type, regardless of the actual relationship between the two URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith()
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith()` checks if the given string starts with the specified value, while `includes()` checks if the given string contains the specified value anywhere. Replacing `includes()` with `startsWith()` would cause the code to always return `false` for the `sublevel` type, regardless of the actual relationship between the two URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match()
```
This would result in different behavior because
