  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet, and it would cause a `ReferenceError` when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` would call the `flush` function with the argument `1`, which is not the same as calling `flush()` without any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(function() {})` would call the `flush` function with an anonymous function as an argument, which is not the same as calling `flush()` without any arguments.

DONE.
