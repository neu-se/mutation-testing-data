  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable 'base' is not defined or has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a concatenation of two string literals. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable 'base' is not defined or has a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the modified code fragment is a concatenation of a string literal and a number. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable 'base' is not defined or has a different value.

DONE.
