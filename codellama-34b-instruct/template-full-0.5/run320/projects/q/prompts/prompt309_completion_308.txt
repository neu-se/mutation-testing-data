  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves the promise, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects the promise. Using `resolve` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw exception` would throw an exception, which would result in the promise being rejected. Using `throw exception` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` would return a value, which would result in the promise being resolved. Using `return` instead of `reject` would cause the promise to be resolved, which would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
