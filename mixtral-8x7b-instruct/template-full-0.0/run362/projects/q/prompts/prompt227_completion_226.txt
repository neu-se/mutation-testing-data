 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would immediately resolve the promise instead of waiting for the `resolve` or `reject` functions to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always resolve the promise, even if the `resolve` or `reject` functions are called later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof messages !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always resolve the promise, even if the `messages` array is empty or not defined.

DONE.
