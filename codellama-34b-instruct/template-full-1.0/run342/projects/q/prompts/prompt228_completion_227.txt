  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushing only the first element of array <code>args</code> to `messages`, but this code fragment pushes the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.unshift(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushing only the first element of array <code>args</code> to `messages`, but this code fragment inserts the entire array at the beginning of `messages`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.splice(2, 0, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushing only the first element of array <code>args</code> to `messages`, but this code fragment inserts the entire array at index 2 in `messages`.

DONE.
