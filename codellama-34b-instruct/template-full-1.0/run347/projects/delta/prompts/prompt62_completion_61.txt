  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of the key-value pairs in the object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(attributes, 'length')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call()` checks whether an object has a property with a specific name, while `Object.keys()` returns an array of all the keys in an object.

DONE.
