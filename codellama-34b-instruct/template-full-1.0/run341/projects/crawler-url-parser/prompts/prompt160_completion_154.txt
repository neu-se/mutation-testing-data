  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^//]*)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the ^ character inside the [] group is escaped, causing it to match any character except a /, whereas in the original code, it is not escaped and matches any character except a \.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^/]*\/)[\/]?$/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the \ character is added to the grouping, causing it to match any character except a /, whereas in the original code, it does not match the \ character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^/]*\/$)/, ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the $ character is added to the grouping, causing it to match any character except a /, whereas in the original code, it does not match the $ character.

DONE.
