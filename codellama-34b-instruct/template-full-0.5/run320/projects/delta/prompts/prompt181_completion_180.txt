  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the `otherIter` iterator by `length` positions, regardless of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the `otherIter` iterator by `length + 1` positions, which could result in skipping over some operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the `otherIter` iterator by `length - 1` positions, which could result in skipping over some operations.

DONE.
