 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^/])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character except '/' instead of '.' or '$'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$]|[+*])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it also matches '+' and '\*' characters in addition to '.' and '$'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't have the global flag (`g`), so it only matches the first occurrence of '.' or '$' in the string.

DONE.
