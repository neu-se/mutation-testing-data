  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so the `when` function would not be called, and the `deferred.reject` function would not be called either, which would cause the promise to never be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so the `when` function would not be called, and the `deferred.reject` function would not be called either, which would cause the promise to never be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, so the `when` function would not be called, and the `deferred.reject` function would not be called either, which would cause the promise to never be rejected.

DONE.
