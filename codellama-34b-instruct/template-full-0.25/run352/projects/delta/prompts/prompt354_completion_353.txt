  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `baseIndex + length` to calculate the new base index, but this replacement code would always return the same value, regardless of the base index or length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `baseIndex + length` to calculate the new base index, but this replacement code would always return a value that is one greater than the base index, regardless of the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return baseIndex - length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was using `baseIndex + length` to calculate the new base index, but this replacement code would always return a value that is the negative of the length, regardless of the base index.

DONE.
