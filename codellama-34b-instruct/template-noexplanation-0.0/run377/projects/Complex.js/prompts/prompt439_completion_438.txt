  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This change will cause the `floor` method to use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, which will result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This change will cause the `floor` method to divide the real part of the complex number by the number of places, which will result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This change will cause the `floor` method to divide the imaginary part of the complex number by the number of places, which will result in a different output.

DONE.
