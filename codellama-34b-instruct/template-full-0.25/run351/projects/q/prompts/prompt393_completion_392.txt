  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `then` method to skip the fulfilled callback and go straight to the rejected callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a fulfilled promise, which would cause the `then` method to skip the rejected callback and go straight to the fulfilled callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a deferred promise, which would cause the `then` method to wait for the deferred promise to be resolved or rejected before proceeding.

DONE.
