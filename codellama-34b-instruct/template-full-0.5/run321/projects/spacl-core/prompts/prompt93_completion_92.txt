  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds an element to the end of the array, while `set` is a method that sets the value of an element at a specific index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of the array, while `set` is a method that sets the value of an element at a specific index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a method that adds an element to the beginning of the array, while `set` is a method that sets the value of an element at a specific index.

DONE.
