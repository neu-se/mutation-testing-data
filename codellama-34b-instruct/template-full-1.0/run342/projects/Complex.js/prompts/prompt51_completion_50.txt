  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite(a)` will return `false` if `a` is NaN or Infinity, while `a['arg'] > 0` will only return `false` if `a['arg']` is NaN or less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(a['arg'] >= 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite(a)` will return `false` if `a` is NaN or Infinity, while `!(a['arg'] >= 0)` will only return `true` if `a['arg']` is NaN or less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite(a)` will return `true` if `a` is NaN or In
