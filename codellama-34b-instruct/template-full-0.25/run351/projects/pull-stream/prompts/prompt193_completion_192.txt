  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `aborted`, so if `aborted` is `true`, the new code would return `false`, and if `aborted` is `false`, the new code would return `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently than the original code, potentially leading to a different outcome in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first operand if it is truthy, and the second operand if the first operand is falsy. If `aborted` is `true`, the new code would return `true`, and if `aborted` is `false`, the new code would return `true` as well. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently than the original code, potentially leading to a different outcome in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
