  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `universalify.fromCallback` function to convert the `fs.writeFile` function to a promise, while the new code fragment directly calls the `fs.writeFileSync` function. This could result in different behavior if the `fs.writeFileSync` function is not properly implemented or if it has different behavior than the `fs.writeFile` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `universalify.fromCallback` function to convert the `fs.writeFile` function to a promise, while the new code fragment directly calls the `fs.writeFile` function. This could result in different behavior if the `fs.writeFile` function is not properly implemented or if it has different behavior than the `fs.writeFileSync` function.
