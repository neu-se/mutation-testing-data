  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an intentional error, whereas the original code would have fulfilled the promise with the result of `Q(object)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Intentional rejection");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an intentional rejection, whereas the original code would have fulfilled the promise with the result of `Q(object)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Intentional resolution");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an intentional resolution, whereas the original code would have fulfilled the promise with the result
