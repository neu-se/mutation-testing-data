  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `size()` is a function and should be called to get the current size of the `_data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an incorrect size for the `_data` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to increment the size of the `_data` object, which would throw an error.

DONE.
