  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwrf' || w === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "dwarf" is incorrectly spelled as "dwrf," causing the test to pass even if the original code fragment is not executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "dwarf" is correctly spelled, but the word "roof" is not, causing the test to fail even if the original code fragment is executed.

DONE.
