Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the column number instead of the line number, which is not the intended value for the function's purpose.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `0` as the line number, which would not reflect the actual line number in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a non-existent index (3) in the `attempt1` array, leading to an `undefined` value instead of the expected line number.

DONE.
