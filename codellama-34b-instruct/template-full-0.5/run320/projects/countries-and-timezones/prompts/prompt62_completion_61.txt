  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"id"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the string "id" instead of the actual identifier.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `undefined` instead of the actual identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `null` instead of the actual identifier.

DONE.
