Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `timeoutId` by adding 1, which is not a valid identifier for clearing the timeout, leading to a failure to clear the correct timeout and potentially causing the promise to reject even if it was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to clear a timeout with an ID of `0`, which is not associated with any active timeout, thus leaving the original timeout intact and causing the promise to reject after the specified timeout period.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to clear a timeout with an ID that is offset by 100, which is not the correct `timeoutId`, leading to the same issue of not clearing the intended timeout and potentially causing the promise to reject incorrectly.

DONE.
