  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the "-" operator would negate the value of `b`, causing the resulting complex number to have a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant factor "2" would multiply the argument of the complex number, causing it to have a different modulus.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant "1" would be added to the argument of the complex number, causing it to have a different modulus.

DONE.
