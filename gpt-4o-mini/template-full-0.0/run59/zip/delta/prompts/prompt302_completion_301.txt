Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it omits the attributes from the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of attributes in the line processing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the attributes of the next operation after the current one, which may not exist, leading to an incorrect index or attributes being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.peek().attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the attributes of the current operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to incorrect processing of the same operation multiple times.

DONE.
