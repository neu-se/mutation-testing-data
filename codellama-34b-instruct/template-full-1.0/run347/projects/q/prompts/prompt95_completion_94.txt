  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `++` operator would be omitted, causing the code to check if the index is equal to the length without incrementing the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index is greater than the length instead of strictly greater than or equal to.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the index is less than or equal to the length instead of strictly greater than or equal to.

DONE.
