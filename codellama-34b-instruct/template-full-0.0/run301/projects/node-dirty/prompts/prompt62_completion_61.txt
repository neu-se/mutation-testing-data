  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Test error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to be destroyed with an error, which would trigger the error handling code in the `_load` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to be ended and then destroyed, which would trigger the `end` and `close` events in the `_flush` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('Test data', () => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the write stream to write some test data and then be destroyed, which would trigger the `write` and `close` events in the `_flush` method.

DONE.
