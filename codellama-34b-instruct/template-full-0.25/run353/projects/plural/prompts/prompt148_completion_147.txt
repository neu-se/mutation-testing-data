  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always capitalize the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the word, regardless of whether it is a noun or not.

DONE.
