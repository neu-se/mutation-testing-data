  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `abortCb` with a different first argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, null, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `abortCb` with a different second argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(abort, onAbort, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `abortCb` with a different third argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
