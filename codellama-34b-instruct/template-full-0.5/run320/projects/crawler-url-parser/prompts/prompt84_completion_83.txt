  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method to get the text content of the link, while this alternative uses the `attr()` method to get the value of the `href` attribute, which may be different from the text content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).find('a').text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the text content of the current link, while this alternative also considers the text content of any nested links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only considers the text content of the current link, while this alternative also considers the text content of the link's parent element.

DONE.
