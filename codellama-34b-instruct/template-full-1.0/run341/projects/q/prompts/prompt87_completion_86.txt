  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function `f` is called with no arguments, while in the modified code, it is called with the value of `arguments` as its only argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function `f` is called with no arguments, while in the modified code, it is called with the value `0` as its only argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the function `f` is called with no arguments, while in the modified code, it is called with the value `1` as its only argument.

DONE.
