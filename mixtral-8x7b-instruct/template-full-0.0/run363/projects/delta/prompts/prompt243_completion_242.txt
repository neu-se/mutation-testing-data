 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0 as the length of the next operation, which may cause the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the type of the next operation instead of its length, causing the `diff()` function to process operations incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the next operation from the iterator and returns it, which may cause the `diff()` function to process operations out of order or skip some operations.

DONE.
