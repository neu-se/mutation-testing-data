  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the result of the `test` function, which means that the `if` statement would be executed even if the `test` function returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is checking if the result of the `test` function is `true` and `false` at the same time, which is always `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is checking if the result of the `test` function is `true` or `true`, which is always `true`.

DONE.
