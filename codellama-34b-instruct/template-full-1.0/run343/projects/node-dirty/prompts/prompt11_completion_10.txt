  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get()` is a method of the `Map` class, while `this._data` is an instance of the `Map` class, so calling `get()` on `this._data` would return the value associated with the given key in the map, rather than the list of callbacks associated with the key in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `size` is a property of the `Map` class, while `this._queue` is an instance of the `Map` class, so calling `size` on `this._queue` would return the number of items in the queue, rather than the list of callbacks associated with the key in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` is a method of the `Map` class,
