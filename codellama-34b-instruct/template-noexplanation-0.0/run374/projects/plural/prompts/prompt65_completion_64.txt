  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacterium'
```
This code fragment will cause the `plural` function to return the same word instead of the correct plural form, resulting in a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteria'
```
This code fragment will cause the `plural` function to return the correct plural form for the word "bacterium", which is "bacteria".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacteriums'
```
This code fragment will cause the `plural` function to return the incorrect plural form for the word "bacterium", which is "bacteriums" instead of "bacteria".

DONE.
