  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` is a different method than `substr`, and it has a different behavior when the end index is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` extracts a different portion of the string than `substr`, and it also has a different behavior when the end index is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `substr`, and it has a different behavior when theend index is negative.

DONE.
