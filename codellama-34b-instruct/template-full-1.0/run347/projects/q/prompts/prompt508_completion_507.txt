  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ui.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" method is not defined on the "ui" object, whereas it is defined on the "value" object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value["apply"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" property is not defined on the "value" object, whereas it is defined as a method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because the "apply" method is not defined on the current object, whereas it is defined as a method on the "value" object.

DONE.
