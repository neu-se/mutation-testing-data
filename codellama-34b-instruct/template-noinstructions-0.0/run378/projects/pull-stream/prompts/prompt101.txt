Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
'use strict'

function id (e) { return e }
var prop = require('../util/prop')
var drain = require('./drain')

module.exports = function find (test, cb) {
  var ended = false
  if(!cb)
    cb = test, test = id
  else
    test = prop(test) || id

  return drain(function (data) {
    if(test(data)) {
      ended = true
      cb(null, data)
    return false
    }
  }, function (err) {
    if(ended) return //already called back
    cb(<PLACEHOLDER>)
  })
}





```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
err === true ? null : err, null
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
