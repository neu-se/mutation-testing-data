  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `zipAFolderOptions` is defined and has a truthy `customWriteStream` property, regardless of the value of `targetFilePath`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && !targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` if `zipAFolderOptions` is defined and has a truthy `customWriteStream` property, regardless of the value of `targetFilePath`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream !== targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` if `zipAFolderOptions` is defined and has a truthy `customWriteStream` property that is not equal to `targetFilePath`, regardless of the value of `targetFile
