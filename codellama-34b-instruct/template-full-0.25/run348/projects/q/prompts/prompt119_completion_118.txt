  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `object_hasOwnProperty` function to be called with the `Object.prototype` object as its context, rather than the `Object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Function.prototype.call)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `call` function to be called with the `Function.prototype` object as its context, rather than the `Function` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis(Array.prototype.slice)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` function to be called with the `Array.prototype` object as its context, rather than the `Array` object.

DONE.
