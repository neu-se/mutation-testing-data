  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, while the replaced code fragment calculates the inverse hyperbolic sine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, while the replaced code fragment calculates the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + Math.sqrt(a * a + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine function, while the replaced code fragment calculates the inverse hyperbolic secant function.

DONE.
