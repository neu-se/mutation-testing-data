  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the accumulator, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the accumulator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the accumulator, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the accumulator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the accumulator by 2, whereas the original code fragment would not modify the accumulator.

DONE.
