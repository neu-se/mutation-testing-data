  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] > 0 && z['im'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['im']` is greater than or equal to 0, but this new code fragment checks if `z['im']` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0 && z['re'] < 0 && z['im'] >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z['re']` is greater than 0, but this new code fragment checks if `z['re']` is less than 0.
