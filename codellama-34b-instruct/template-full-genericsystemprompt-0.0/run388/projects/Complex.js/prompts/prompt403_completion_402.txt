  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the `re` property is the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property is the real part of the complex number, and adding 1 to it would change the value of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property is the imaginary part of the complex number, and multiplying it by 2 would change the value of the expression.

DONE.
