  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0 && this['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and if the real part of the current complex number is zero, which is not the same as checking if the imaginary part of the current complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0 && this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the complex number is zero, and if the imaginary part of the current complex number is not zero, which is not the same as checking if the imaginary part of the current complex number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
