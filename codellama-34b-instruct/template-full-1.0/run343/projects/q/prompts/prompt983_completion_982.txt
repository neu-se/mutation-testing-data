  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("send", [name, nodeArgs]).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because "send" is the name of a different event than "post," which would cause the code to emit a different event when the promise fails.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs]).resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is the name of a different event than "fail," which would cause the code to emit a different event when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("post", [name, nodeArgs, deferred.resolve])
```
This would result in different behavior because "deferred.resolve" is a different argument than "deferred.reject," which would cause the code to resolve the promise with different values.

DONE.
