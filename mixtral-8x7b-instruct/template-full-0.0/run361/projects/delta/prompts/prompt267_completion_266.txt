 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.push('');
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes an empty string to `retDelta`, which is not the same as the original code that pushes an operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element from `retDelta`, which may not be the intended operation, and can lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
retDelta.splice(0, 0, otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts `otherOp` at the beginning of `retDelta`, changing the order of operations and potentially affecting the overall functionality.

DONE.
