  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of the next operation in the iterator, while this replacement checks for the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the type of the next operation in the other iterator, while this replacement checks for the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the length of the next operation in the iterator, while this replacement checks for the length of the current operation.

DONE.
