  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` property would always be initialized with the `id` value, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to always return a country object with a non-empty `current` property, even if the `tz.r` property is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property would always be initialized with the `id` value, instead of an empty array. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to always return a country object with a non-empty `all` property, even if the `tz.r` property is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [id], all: [id] } }
