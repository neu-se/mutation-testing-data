  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy or not, while this new code fragment always sets `end` to `abort` regardless of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy or not, while this new code fragment flips the value of `end` to its opposite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort || end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `end` is truthy or not, while this new code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy or not, and only if it is not truthy, it sets `end` to its original value.

DONE.
