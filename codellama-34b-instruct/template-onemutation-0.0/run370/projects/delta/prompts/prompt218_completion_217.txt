  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1`, which means the `concat` method will concatenate the `other` delta's ops with the current delta's ops starting from index `1`. However, if we replace it with `0`, the method will concatenate the `other` delta's ops with the current delta's ops starting from index `0`, which is the beginning of the delta. This would result in a different behavior because the concatenation would start from a different index.

DONE.
