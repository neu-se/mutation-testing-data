  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function would not be called, and the promise would not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.nonexistentMethod();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonexistentMethod` method does not exist on the `deferred` object, and an error would be thrown instead of resolving or rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve("foo");
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value "foo", instead of the expected behavior where the promise is resolved or rejected based on the result of the `callback` function.

DONE.
