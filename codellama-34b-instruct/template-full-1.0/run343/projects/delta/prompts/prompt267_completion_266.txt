  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.delete` would delete the currently selected text, while `retDelta.push` would insert it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` would retain the currently selected text, while `retDelta.push` would insert it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `retDelta.insert` would insert a new text at the current cursor position, while `retDelta.push` would move the cursor to the end of the line.

DONE.
