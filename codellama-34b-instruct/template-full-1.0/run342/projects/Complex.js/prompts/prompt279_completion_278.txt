  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the `a` value, which means that the negative sine of `a` would be returned instead of the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential function of `b`, which means that the `b` value would be raised to a power of 2, whereas the original code fragment raised `a` to a power of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the maximum value of `a` and `b`, whereas the original code fragment used the addition operator to combine `a` and `b`.

DONE.
