  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the code would always return `true` if `countries[id]` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the code would always return `true` if `countries[id]` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property, so the code would always return `true` if `countries` has the property `id`.

DONE.
