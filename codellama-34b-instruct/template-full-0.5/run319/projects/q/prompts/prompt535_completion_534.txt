  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` and `rejected` parameters would be passed to the `spread` method, which would cause the promise to be rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected, fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` and `fulfilled` parameters would be passed to the `spread` method in reverse order, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of the `rejected` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would be called with two `null` values, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with an empty array.

DONE.
