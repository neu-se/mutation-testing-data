  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `slice` method to return one fewer element than the original code, which could potentially cause the `invert` method to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
