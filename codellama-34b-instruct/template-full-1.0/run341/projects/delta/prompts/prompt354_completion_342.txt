  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```x```
This would result in different behavior because the operator ```!=``` is replaced with a comparison operator ```!==``` which can change the result when the value is the same but the type is different, as it will return true if the value and type are not strictly equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```priority = true```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the variable `priority` to `true`, even when it was previously set to `false`. This can cause the function to execute differently, depending on what code comes before it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```index = index + length```
This would result in different behavior because it always increments the `index` variable by `length`, regardless of the outcome of the `if` statement. This can change the result of the function, depending on the value of `length` and the current index.

DONE.
