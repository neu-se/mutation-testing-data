  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater-than operator, which will evaluate to true if i is greater than max, while the new code fragment uses a less-than operator, which will evaluate to true if i is less than max.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater-than operator, which will evaluate to true if i is greater than max, while the new code fragment uses an assignment operator, which will always evaluate to true and set i to max.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater-than operator, which will evaluate to true if i is greater than max, while the new code fragment uses an equality operator, which will always evaluate to true and check if i is equal to max.

DONE.
