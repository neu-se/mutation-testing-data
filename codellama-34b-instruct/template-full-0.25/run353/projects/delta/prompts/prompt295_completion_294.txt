  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next()` is a function call that returns the next element in the iteration, whereas `iter.next` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(1)` would advance the iteration by one element, whereas `iter.next` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next(2)` would advance the iteration by two elements, whereas `iter.next` would not.

DONE.
