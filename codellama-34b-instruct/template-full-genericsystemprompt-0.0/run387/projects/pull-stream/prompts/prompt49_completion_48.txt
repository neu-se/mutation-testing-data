  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i <= length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code, potentially causing the `read` function to be called with an invalid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last argument, potentially causing the `read` function to be called with an invalid argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i < length + 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than the original code, potentially causing the `read` function to be called with an invalid argument.

DONE.
