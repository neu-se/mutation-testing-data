  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the wrong index, potentially causing the code to skip over important iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one time too many, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the wrong index, potentially causing the code to skip over important iterations.

DONE.
