  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last letter of the word, instead of the last two letters, which would result in incorrect plural form for words that require removing the last two letters to form the plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length, w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra letter to the end of the word, which would result in incorrect plural form for words that require adding a specific letter to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length / 2, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the length of the word by 2, rather than subtracting 2 from the length, which would result in incorrect plural form for words that require subtracting 2 from the length.

DONE.
