 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then.get
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to call the `get` method on the result of the `then` method, which would not have a `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise['get']
