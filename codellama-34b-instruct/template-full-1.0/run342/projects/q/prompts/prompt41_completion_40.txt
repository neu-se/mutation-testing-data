  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("I am a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the program to end abruptly, whereas the original code fragment would simply call the `flush` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("I am a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console, but it would not actually cause any errors or exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to perform an operation on the value `undefined`, which would cause a run-time error.

DONE.
