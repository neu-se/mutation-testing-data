  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the `_queue` map instead of the `_data` map, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the values of the `_data` map instead of the keys, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This change will cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the entries of the `_data` map instead of the keys, which may cause the method to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
