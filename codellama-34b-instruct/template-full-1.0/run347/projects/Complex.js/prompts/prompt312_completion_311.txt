  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a + b` would be evaluated as a sum instead of a linear fraction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a - b` would be evaluated as a difference instead of a linear fraction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2a
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `2a` would be evaluated as twice the value of `a` instead of a linear fraction.

DONE.
