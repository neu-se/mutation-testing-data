  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise["then"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is defined as a method, while `promise["then"]` is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(Q.when)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that takes a promise and returns a new promise that is resolved with the resolved value of the original promise, while `promise.then` is a method that takes a callback function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, Q.when)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid callback function that does nothing, while `Q.when` is a function that takes a promise and returns a new promise that is resolved with the resolved value of the original promise.

DONE.
