  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the BOM removed. By calling `toLowerCase()` on the function, we are effectively changing the function itself, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the BOM removed. By calling `toUpperCase()` on the function, we are effectively changing the function itself, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stripBom.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `stripBom` is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the BOM removed. By calling `substring(
