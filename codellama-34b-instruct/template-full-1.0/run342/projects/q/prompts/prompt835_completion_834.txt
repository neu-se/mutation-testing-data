  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && process.domain.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.domain` may be an object, and `process.domain.constructor` may not be `Function`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.domain && process.domain.prop !== "value"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.domain.prop` may be undefined or null, and `!==` operator will return `true` for these cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.domain === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof process.domain` returns `undefined` if `process.domain` is not defined.

DONE.
