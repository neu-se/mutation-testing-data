 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
require('fs').createWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a potential error due to the incorrect module import syntax, which uses `require` instead of the ES6 import statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createReadStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a readable stream instead of a writable one, causing the archiver to not write any data to the output file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.createWriteStream('', {flags: 'a'})
