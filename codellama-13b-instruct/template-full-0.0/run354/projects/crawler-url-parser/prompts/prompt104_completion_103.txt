  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is used to check if a string includes a substring, while the original code uses the `==` operator to check for equality. This could result in different behavior if the `text` property of the `tmpUrl` object is not a string, or if the `text` property contains a substring that is not equal to the `text` property of the `el` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text === el.text
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used to check for strict equality, while the original code uses the `==` operator to check for equality. This could result in different behavior if the `text` property of the `tmpUrl` object is not a string, or if the `text` property contains a substring that is not equal to the `text` property of the `el` object.
