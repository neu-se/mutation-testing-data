 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the last argument instead of a node resolver function, causing the Node.js-style callback to never resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `resolve` method of the deferred object instead of a node resolver function, causing the Node.js-style callback to always resolve with `undefined`.

DONE.
