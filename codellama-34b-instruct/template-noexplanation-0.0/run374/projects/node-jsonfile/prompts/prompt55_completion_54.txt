  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces + 1
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to add an extra space to the output string, which may cause issues with the code that consumes the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces - 1
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to remove an extra space from the output string, which may cause issues with the code that consumes the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces * 2
```
This change will cause the `stringify` function to double the number of spaces in the output string, which may cause issues with the code that consumes the output.

DONE.
