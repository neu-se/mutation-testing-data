  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be set to `null`, which would cause the `reduce` function to throw an error when it tries to call `cb` with the final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `acc` variable would be set to `null`, which would cause the `reduce` function to throw an error when it tries to call `reducer` with the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reducer = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reducer` function would be set to `null`, which would cause the `reduce` function to throw an error when it tries to call `reducer` with the final result.

DONE.
