  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a different method than `includes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `promise` is in `reportedUnhandledRejections` instead of `unhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.indexOf(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `reason` is in `unhandledReasons` instead of `unhandledRejections`.

DONE.
