  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value of the currentUrl in the map, regardless of whether it already exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the currentUrl exists in the map, and if it doesn't, it would set it as a new value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the currentUrl exists in the map, and if it doesn't, it would set it as a new value.

DONE.
