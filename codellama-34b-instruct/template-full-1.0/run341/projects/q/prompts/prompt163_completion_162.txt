  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/§§/
```
This would result in different behavior because a backslash character is not a valid line feed character. The resulting code would produce a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*LINE-FEED*
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would match any character that is not a line feed. The resulting code would likely produce a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\u2028
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would match any character that is not the Unicode line separator character (U+2028). The resulting code would likely produce a syntax error.

DONE.
