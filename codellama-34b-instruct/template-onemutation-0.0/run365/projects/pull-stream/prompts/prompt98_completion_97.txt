  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with `null` as the second argument when `err` is `true`, while the new code fragment calls the callback with `null` as the first argument regardless of the value of `err`.
