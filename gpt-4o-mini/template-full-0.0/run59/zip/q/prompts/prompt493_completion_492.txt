Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `rejected` would cause the promise to not indicate that it was rejected, potentially leading to unhandled rejections in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `rejected` would incorrectly signal that the promise was successfully handled, which could lead to confusion in the promise's state management.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `this` instead of `rejected` would return the promise itself, which could mislead the caller into thinking the promise was fulfilled rather than rejected.

DONE.
