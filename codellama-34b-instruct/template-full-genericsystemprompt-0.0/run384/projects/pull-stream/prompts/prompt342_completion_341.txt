  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, `!abort` would be `false`, and the `onAbort` callback would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, `abort + 1` would be `2`, and the `onAbort` callback would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate the second operand (`onAbort`) if the first operand (`abort`) is truthy, so if `abort` is `true`, the `onAbort` callback would
