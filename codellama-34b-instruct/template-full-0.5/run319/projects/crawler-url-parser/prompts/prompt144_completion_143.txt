  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match a different set of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would be case-insensitive, meaning it would match URLs with uppercase letters as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match all occurrences of the pattern in the URL, instead of just the first one.

DONE.
