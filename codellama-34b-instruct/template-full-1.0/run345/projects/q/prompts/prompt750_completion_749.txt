  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reject the promise if any of the promises in the array are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reject the promise if all of the promises in the array are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not reject the promise if all of the promises in the array are resolved or rejected.

DONE.
