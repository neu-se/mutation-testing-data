  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   if (this['isZero']("")) {
        return Complex['INFINITY'];
   }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` since the `isZero` method takes no arguments and is comparing a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
   if (this['isZero']()) {
        return Complex['INFINITY'];
   } else {
        return Complex['ZERO'];
   }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would throw an error since it takes no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  if (this['isZero']() === "") {
        return Complex['INFINITY'];
   }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method would always evaluate to `false` since it takes no arguments.

DONE.
