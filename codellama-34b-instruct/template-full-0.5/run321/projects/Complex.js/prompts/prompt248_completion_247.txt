  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1` is a function that returns the value of `e^a - 1`, whereas `Math.exp` is a function that returns the value of `e^a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` is a function that returns the value of `e^a`, whereas `Math.expm1` is a function that returns the value of `e^a - 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` is a function that returns the natural logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.exp` and `Math.expm1` are functions that return the exponential of a number.

DONE.
