  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a dot or a dollar sign, instead of matching any character that is not a dot.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more characters that are not a dot or a dollar sign, instead of matching a single character that is not a dot.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([^.$])*/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match zero or more characters that are not a dot or a dollar sign, instead of matching a single character that is not a dot.

DONE.
