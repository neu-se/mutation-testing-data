  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && window.location.href.indexOf("https") === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the current URL starts with "https", which is a common indicator of a secure connection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && window.location.protocol === "https:"
```
This code fragment checks if the current URL uses the "https" protocol, which is another way to check for a secure connection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "undefined" && window.location.hostname.endsWith(".secure.example.com")
```
This code fragment checks if the current URL ends with a specific domain name, which is a common practice for secure websites.

DONE.
