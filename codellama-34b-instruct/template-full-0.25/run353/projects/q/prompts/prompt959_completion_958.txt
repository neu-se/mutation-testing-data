  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.sort()` would sort the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.splice(0, 1)` would remove the first element of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
