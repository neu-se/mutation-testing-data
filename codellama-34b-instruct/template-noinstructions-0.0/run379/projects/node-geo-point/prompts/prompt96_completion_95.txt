  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the bearing, which takes into account the quadrant of the angle. The replaced code would only calculate the bearing based on the difference in longitude, which would result in incorrect bearings for locations near the 180th meridian.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the bearing, which takes into account the quadrant of the angle. The replaced code would only calculate the bearing based on the difference in longitude and the cosine of the latitude, which would result in incorrect bearings for locations near the poles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * sin(φ1)
```
This would result
