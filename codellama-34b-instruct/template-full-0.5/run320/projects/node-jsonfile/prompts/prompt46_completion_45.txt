  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFile` is a function that asynchronously writes data to a file, whereas `fs.writeFileSync` is a function that synchronously writes data to a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fs.writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fs` is a different file system module than `fs`, and `writeFileSync` is a function that synchronously writes data to a file in the `_fs` module.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
require('fs').writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `require('fs')` loads the `fs` module and returns it, so `require('fs').writeFileSync` is a function that synchronously writes data to a file in the `fs` module.

DONE.
