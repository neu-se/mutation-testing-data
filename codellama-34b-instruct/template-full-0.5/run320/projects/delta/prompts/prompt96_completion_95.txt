  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the newOp at the beginning of the ops array, rather than at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the newOp at the end of the ops array, rather than at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly insert the newOp at any position in the ops array, rather than at the current index.

DONE.
