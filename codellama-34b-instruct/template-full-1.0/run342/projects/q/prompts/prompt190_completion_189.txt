  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[1]` would return the first capture group of the regular expression `/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec(stackLine)`, which is the file name, while `attempt2[2]` would return the second capture group, which is the line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3[2]` would return the second capture group of the regular expression `/.*@(.+):(\d+)$/.exec(stackLine)`, which is the line number, while `attempt2[2]` would return undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"myfilename.js"
```
This would result in different behavior because the filename that is returned would change from the actual filename to the string "myfilename.js".

DONE.
