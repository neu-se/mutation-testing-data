  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and `onAbort + 1` would result in a different function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and `onAbort(null)` would result in a different function being called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and `onAbort.bind(null)` would result in a different function being called with a different `this` context.

DONE.
