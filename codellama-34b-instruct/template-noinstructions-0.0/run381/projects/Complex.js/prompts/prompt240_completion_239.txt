  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * (r + a)`, which is the correct formula for the magnitude of a complex number. Replacing it with `2 * (r - a)` would give an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * (r + a)`, which is the correct formula for the magnitude of a complex number. Replacing it with `2 * (r + b)` would give an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `2 * (r + a)`, which is the correct formula for the magnitude of a complex number. Replacing it with `2 * (r - b)` would give an incorrect result.

DONE.
