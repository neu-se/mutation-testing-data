  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(this.attributes, other.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `diff` method of `AttributeMap` to compare the attributes of the two `Delta` objects, rather than the `diff` method of `Delta` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(other.attributes, this.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `diff` method of `AttributeMap` to compare the attributes of the two `Delta` objects in the opposite order, rather than the `diff` method of `Delta` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
AttributeMap.diff(this.attributes, other.attributes, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `diff` method of `AttributeMap` to compare the attributes of the two `Delta` objects, but with the `priority` argument set to `true`, which would
