  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would unconditionally call `read` with `true` as the first argument, whereas the original code would only call `read` with `true` if `err` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call `cb` with `err` as the first argument, whereas the original code would only call `cb` with `err` if `err` is not `true`.

DONE.
