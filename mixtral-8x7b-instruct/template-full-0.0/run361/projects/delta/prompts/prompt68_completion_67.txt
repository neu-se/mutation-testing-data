 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one more character than intended, potentially causing the resulting string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ delete: Math.floor(length) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always round down when deleting, potentially causing the resulting string to be incorrect if the length is a decimal number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{ delete: length * 2 }
