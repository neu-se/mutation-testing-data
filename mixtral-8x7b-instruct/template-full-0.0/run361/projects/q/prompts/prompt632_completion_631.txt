 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is used instead of the `key` variable, which would cause the `delete` operation to always fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is used instead of the `key` variable, which would cause the `delete` operation to always fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is used instead of the `key` variable, which would cause the `delete` operation to always fail.

DONE.
