  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, and its absence would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function, and calling it as a function would cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function is not the same as the `cb` function, and calling it would not have the same effect as calling `cb`.

DONE.
