Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would not have the '$' character escaped, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath + targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would be a concatenation of the current and target paths, rather than replacing the current path with the target path, potentially leading to incorrect file copying.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath.replace('$', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string would remove all '$' characters from the target path, rather than escaping them, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements or errors if the target path relies on '$' characters for its functionality.

DONE.
