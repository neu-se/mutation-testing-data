Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"An error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of rejecting with the original exception, it would reject with a string message, which may not provide the necessary context for debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because rejecting with `null` would not convey any error information, potentially leading to silent failures where the caller cannot determine what went wrong.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Default rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a new error message regardless of the actual exception that occurred, obscuring the original error context and making it harder to diagnose issues.

DONE.
