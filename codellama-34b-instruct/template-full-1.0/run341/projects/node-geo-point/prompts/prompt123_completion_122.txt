  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` object to be passed as the `point` argument, but instead, it receives a number. This would likely cause an error to be thrown when the method attempts to access the `longitude` property of the `point` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` object to be passed as the `point` argument, but instead, it receives `null`. This would likely cause an error to be thrown when the method attempts to access the `longitude` property of the `point` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(1, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method expects a `GeoPoint` object to be passed as the
