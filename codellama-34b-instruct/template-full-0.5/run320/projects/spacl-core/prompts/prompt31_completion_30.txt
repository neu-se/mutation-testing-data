  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `$$` would be interpreted as a single dollar sign, rather than the end of the string, which could cause the regular expression to match incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `#` would be interpreted as a special character, rather than the end of the string, which could cause the regular expression to match incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `\\` would be interpreted as a single backslash, rather than the end of the string, which could cause the regular expression to match incorrectly.

DONE.
