  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method is used to create a shallow copy of an array, but the `reverse` method is used to reverse the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is used to get the number of elements in the array, but the `array_slice` method is used to create a shallow copy of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method is used to remove the last element from an array, but the `array_slice` method is used to create a shallow copy of an array.

DONE.
