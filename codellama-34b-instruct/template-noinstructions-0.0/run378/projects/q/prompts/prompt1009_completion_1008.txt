  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `nodeArgs` array would have one element, but the replaced code fragment would have zero elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `nodeArgs` array would have one element, but the replaced code fragment would have two elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `1`, which means that the `nodeArgs` array would have one element, but the replaced code fragment would have a negative number of elements.

DONE.
