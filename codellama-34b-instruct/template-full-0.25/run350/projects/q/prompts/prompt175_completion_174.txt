  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the stack trace to be printed in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method returns a new array with all elements except the first one, which would cause the first line of the stack trace to be omitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.filter(function(line) { return line.indexOf("node_modules") === -1; }).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would remove any lines that contain the string "node_modules", which would cause the stack trace to be incomplete.

DONE.
