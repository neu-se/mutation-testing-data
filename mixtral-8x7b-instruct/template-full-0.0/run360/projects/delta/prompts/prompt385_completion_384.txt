 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator instead of the `otherIter` iterator. This could cause the function to behave differently when processing operations in the `other` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses a length of 0, which could cause the function to skip over operations in the `other` delta or process them incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' ? Infinity : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Infinity` as the length when the current operation in the `thisIter` iterator is an insertion. This could cause the function to skip over a large number of operations in the `other` delta or process them incorrectly.

DONE.
