  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of an error object, while the new code fragment would always pass a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of an error object, while the new code fragment would always pass a new error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking for the presence of an error object, while the new code fragment would always pass an undefined value.

DONE.
