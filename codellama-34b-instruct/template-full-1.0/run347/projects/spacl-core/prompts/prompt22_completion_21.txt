  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return super.test(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because `super.test(string)` would call the `test` method on the superclass, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return regex.test(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because `regex.test(string)` would call the `test` method on the `RegExp` object created by the `compile` function, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.regex.test(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.test(string)` would call the `test` method on the `RegExp` object created by the constructor, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
