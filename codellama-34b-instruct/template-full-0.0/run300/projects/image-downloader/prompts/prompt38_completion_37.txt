  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `dest` string with the string `'foo'`, resulting in a different file name than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `dest` string to uppercase, resulting in a different file name than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `dest` string into an array of substrings using the `.` character as the delimiter, and the `[0]` index would select the first element of the array, resulting in a different file name than the original code.

DONE.
