  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `undefined` instead of `null`, which may cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return `0` instead of `null`, which may cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This change will cause the `map` function to return an empty object instead of `null`, which may cause the `asyncMap` function to behave differently.

DONE.
