 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return Infinity when dividing by zero when the dividend is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return Infinity when dividing by zero when the divisor is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isNaN']() || z['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return NaN when dividing by zero, even though the result should be Infinity or Zero.

DONE.
