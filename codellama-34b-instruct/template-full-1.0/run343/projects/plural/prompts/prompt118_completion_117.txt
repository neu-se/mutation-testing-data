  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })

This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the 's' to the end of the word regardless of whether it ends in 'cs' or not, while the new code only adds the 'es' suffix to words that end in 'ics'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w + 'is' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds the 's' to the end of the word regardless of whether it ends in 'cs' or not, while the new code only adds the 'is' suffix to words that end in 'ics'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/ics$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/cs$/i, 'xes') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds
