Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(Op.length(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of deleting the operation, it would incorrectly push the length of the operation onto the inverted Delta, potentially leading to an incorrect representation of the inverted operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more length than intended, which could cause the inverted Delta to incorrectly represent the number of operations, leading to mismatches in the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(Op.length(op) - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete one less than the intended length of the operation, which could result in missing operations in the inverted Delta and thus an incorrect transformation.

DONE.
