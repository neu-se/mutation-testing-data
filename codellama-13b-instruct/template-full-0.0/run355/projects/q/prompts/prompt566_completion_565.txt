  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(result, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function is called with the `result` of the `generator[verb](arg)` expression, which could be a promise or a value. In the original code, the `when` function is called with the `result` of the `generator[verb](arg)` expression, which is always a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function is called with the `result` of the `generator[verb](arg)` expression, which could be a promise or a value. In the original code, the `callback` function is called with the `result` of the `generator[verb](arg)` expression, which is always a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result).then(callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(result
