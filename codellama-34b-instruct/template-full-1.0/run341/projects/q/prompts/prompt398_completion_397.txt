  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `null` as the value to resolve, the `thenResolve` method will return a promise that is rejected, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `undefined` as the value to resolve, the `thenResolve` method will return a promise that is rejected, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because when using `false` as the value to resolve, the `thenResolve` method will return a promise that is rejected, whereas the original code fragment returns a promise that is resolved with the value `value`.

DONE.
