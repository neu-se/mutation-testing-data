  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === 'string' ? thisOp.insert : 'not a string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `thisOp.insert` is equal to the string 'isEqual', but the replacement code checks if it is equal to the string 'not a string', which would never be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === 'string' ? 'not a string' : thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value of `thisOp.insert` is equal to the string 'isEqual', but the replacement code checks if it is not equal to the string 'not a string', which would always be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.insert === 'string' ? thisOp.insert.toUpperCase() : thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks
