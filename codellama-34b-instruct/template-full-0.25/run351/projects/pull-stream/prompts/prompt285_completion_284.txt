  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` calls the callback function with two arguments: `end` and `data`. However, the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the callback function with only one argument: `null` and `data`. This would cause the callback function to be called with a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause it to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
