  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, start
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newline` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `start` variable is not used in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newline` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `0` value is not used in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newline, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newline` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `1` value is not used in the code.

DONE.
