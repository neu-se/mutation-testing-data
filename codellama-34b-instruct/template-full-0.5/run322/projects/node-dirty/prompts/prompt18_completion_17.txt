  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `cbs` array was empty, while the modified code fragment would check if the `cbs` array has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was pushing a new callback function onto the `cbs` array, while the modified code fragment would remove the last callback function from the `cbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was pushing a new callback function onto the `cbs` array, while the modified code fragment would remove the first callback function from the `cbs` array.

DONE.
