  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the value `null`, which is different from the original value `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the value `undefined`, which is different from the original value `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be explicitly rejected with the value `object`, which is different from the original behavior of resolving or rejecting the promise based on the state of `object`.

DONE.
