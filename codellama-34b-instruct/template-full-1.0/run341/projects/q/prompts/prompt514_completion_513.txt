  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a method that returns a new promise, while `defer` is likely undefined in the context of the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred = Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is likely undefined in the context of the code snippet, while `Q.defer()` returns a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise = Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is likely undefined in the context of the code snippet, while `Q.defer()` returns a new promise.
