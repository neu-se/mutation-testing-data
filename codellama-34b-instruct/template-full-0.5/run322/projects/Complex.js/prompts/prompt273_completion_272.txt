  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im']` is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `this['re']` is the real part. Using `this['im']` instead of `this['re']` would cause the `arg` function to return the argument of the imaginary part instead of the real part, which would result in a different angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['re'] + 1` would add 1 to the real part of the complex number, which would change the angle of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['im'] + 1` would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which would change the angle of the number.

DONE.
