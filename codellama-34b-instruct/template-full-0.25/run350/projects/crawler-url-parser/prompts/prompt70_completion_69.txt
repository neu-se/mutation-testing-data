  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `cheerio.parse` is a different function from `cheerio.load` and would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.load
```
This would result in different behavior because `$.load` is a different function from `cheerio.load` and would likely cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$("body").load
```
This would result in different behavior because `$("body").load` is a different function from `cheerio.load` and would likely cause the code to fail.

DONE.
