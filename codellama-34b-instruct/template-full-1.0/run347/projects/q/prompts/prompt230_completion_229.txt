  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "progress" && operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "when" operator, while this option checks for the "progress" operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "progress" || operands[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "when" operator, while this option checks for the "progress" operator or the operand at index 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "progress" && operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the "when" operator, while this option checks for the "progress" operator and the operand at index 2.

DONE.
