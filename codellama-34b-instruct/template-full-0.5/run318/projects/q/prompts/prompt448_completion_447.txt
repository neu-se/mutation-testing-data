  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This change would cause the `trackRejection` function to remove the last unhandled rejection instead of adding a new one, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise library.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This change would cause the `trackRejection` function to remove the first unhandled rejection instead of adding a new one, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the promise library.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy
