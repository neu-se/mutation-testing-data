  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a function that takes an optional `noThrow` argument, and passing `true` would cause it to throw an error if the promise is rejected. In the original code, the error would be caught and passed to the `deferred.reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a function that takes an optional `noThrow` argument, and passing `false` would cause it to not throw an error if the promise is rejected. In the original code, the error would be caught and passed to the `deferred.reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeResolver` is a function that takes an optional `noThrow
