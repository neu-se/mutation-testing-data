  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a comma to separate the glob patterns, while the new code uses a space. This could cause the glob patterns to be misinterpreted and the wrong files to be included in the archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a comma to separate the glob patterns, while the new code uses a semicolon. This could cause the glob patterns to be misinterpreted and the wrong files to be included in the archive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'|'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a comma to separate the glob patterns, while the new code uses a pipe character. This could cause the glob patterns to be misinterpreted and the wrong files to be included in the archive.

DONE.
