  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function as its argument, and passing `null` would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function that takes a single argument, and passing an empty function would not satisfy this requirement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(function (x) {});
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` expects a function that takes a single argument, and passing a function that takes a different number of arguments would not satisfy this requirement.

DONE.
