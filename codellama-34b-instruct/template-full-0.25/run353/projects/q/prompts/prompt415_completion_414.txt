  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isPromise` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `value` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromiseAlike` function checks if the object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method but may not be a true promise. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `value` is not a true promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPending` function checks if the promise is in a pending state, which means it has not been resolved or rejected yet. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if
