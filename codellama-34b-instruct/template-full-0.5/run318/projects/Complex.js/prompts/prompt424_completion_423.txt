  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isFinite` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the `inverse` method to return `Complex.INFINITY` when the input is a finite number, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), whereas `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite. Using `isNaN` instead of `isInfinite` would cause the `inverse` method to return `Complex.INFINITY` when the input is NaN, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imag
