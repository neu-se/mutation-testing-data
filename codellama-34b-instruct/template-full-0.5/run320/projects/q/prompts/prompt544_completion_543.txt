  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code checks if the string "undefined" is undefined, which is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code checks if the string "undefined" is not undefined, which is always true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof StopIteration !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `StopIteration` is undefined, while this new code checks if the typeof `StopIteration` is not undefined, which is always true.

DONE.
