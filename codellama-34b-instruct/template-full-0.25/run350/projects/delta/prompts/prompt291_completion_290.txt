  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) - start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the index of the newline character in the string, rather than the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.length - start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the length of the string, rather than the index of the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const index = thisOp.insert.indexOf(newline, start) + start;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the index of the newline character in the string, and then add the start index to it, rather than subtracting the start index.

DONE.
