  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `null` instead of `abort`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `undefined` instead of `abort`, which may also cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This change will cause the `read` function to be called with `true` instead of `abort`, which may cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
