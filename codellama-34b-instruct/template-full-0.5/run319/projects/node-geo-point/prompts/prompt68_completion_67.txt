  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, but only one is provided, causing the function to return `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, but only one is provided, causing the function to return `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, but only one is provided, causing the function to return `NaN`.

DONE.
