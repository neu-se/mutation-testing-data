 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.load()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.load()` would throw a `TypeError` since the `load` method is not defined as a method on the `Dirty` class. The original `this._load` is a reference to a private method that is defined later in the class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = this._load.bind(this);

This would result in different behavior because it would change the meaning of `this` inside the `_load` method. The original code does not use `bind` because the value of `this` inside `_load` is already correctly set due to the way the method is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const that = this;
this._load = function() {
  // ...
  that.emit('load', 0);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the
