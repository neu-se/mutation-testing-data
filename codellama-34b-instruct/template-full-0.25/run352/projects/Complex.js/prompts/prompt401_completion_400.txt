  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is greater than 0. This would cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['re'] <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the real part of the result is less than or equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is greater than 0. This would cause the function to return a different result for certain inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res['im'] != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part of the result is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if it is not equal to 0. This would cause the function to return
