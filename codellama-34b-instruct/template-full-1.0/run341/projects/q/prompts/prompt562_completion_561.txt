  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop if the function is called with a promise that is not already resolved or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a promise, which could potentially cause issues in code that relies on the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to throw an error instead of returning a promise, which could potentially cause issues in code that relies on the returned promise.

DONE.
