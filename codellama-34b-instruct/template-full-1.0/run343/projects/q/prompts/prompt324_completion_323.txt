  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would propagate the error, while the replaced code would throw a new error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return y;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would throw an error if `x` and `y` are not the same, while the replaced code would return `y` regardless of whether they are the same or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return x;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would throw an error if `x` and `y` are not the same, while the replaced code would return `x` regardless of whether they are the same or not.

DONE.
