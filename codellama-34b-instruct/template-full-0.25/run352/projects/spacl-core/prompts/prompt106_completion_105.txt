  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path, while `matches` is a method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path and context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a method that takes two arguments, `path` and `ctx`, while `matches` is a method that takes three arguments, `name`, `path`, and `ctx`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.match(path, ctx) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path and context, while `matches` returns a boolean value indicating whether the policy matches the given path, context, and name.

DONE.
