  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise, which would change the value of the `error` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, Q.delay(promise, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise after a delay of 1 second.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, Q.timeout(promise, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout()` returns a new promise that is rejected if the original promise is not resolved within a timeout period of 1 second.

DONE.
