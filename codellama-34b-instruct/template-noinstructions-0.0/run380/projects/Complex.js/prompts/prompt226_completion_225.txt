  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` would return the square root of `a`, which is not the same as `Math.sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a^2 + b^2)` would return the square root of the sum of `a^2` and `b^2`, which is not the same as `Math.sqrt(a^2)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a^2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a^2)` would return the square root of `a^2`, which is not the same as `Math.sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`.

DONE.
