  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `{}` object would cause the `stringify` function to fail, as it expects a string as its second argument, not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a `null` value as its second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, 'invalid'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive an invalid value as its second argument, which would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
