 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.slice().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method modifies the original array, so the `props` array will be empty in the `Matcher` constructor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array, but it doesn't copy the elements from the original array, so the `props` array will be empty in the `Matcher` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sort` method sorts the elements of the `props` array in place, potentially changing the order of the elements.

DONE.
