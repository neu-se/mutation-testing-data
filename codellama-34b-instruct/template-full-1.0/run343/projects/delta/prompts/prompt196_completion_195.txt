  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the previous operation instead of the last one, potentially causing the "compose" method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the operation before the previous one, potentially causing the "compose" method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the first operation instead of the last one, potentially causing the "compose" method to behave differently.

DONE.
