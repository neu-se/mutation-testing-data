 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method expects two arguments, `op` and `args`, but it would receive `null` instead. This could cause a `TypeError` or unexpected behavior depending on how `dispatch` handles `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"op", ["args"]
