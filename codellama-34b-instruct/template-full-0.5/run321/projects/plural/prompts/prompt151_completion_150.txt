  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `this` to refer to the original string, while the new code fragment uses `this.toLowerCase()` to refer to the lowercase version of the original string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `word` to refer to the original string, while the new code fragment uses `word.toUpperCase()` to refer to the uppercase version of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `word` to refer to the original string, while the new code fragment uses `word.split('').reverse().join('')` to refer to the reversed version of the original string.

DONE.
