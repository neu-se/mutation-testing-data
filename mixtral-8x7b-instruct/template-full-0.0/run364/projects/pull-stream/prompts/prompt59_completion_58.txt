 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end) {
    return sink.abort()
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbed` variable is always set to true, causing the `while` loop to continue even when the stream has ended. This could lead to the `done` callback being called multiple times or not at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
  if (end) {
    return sink.abort(true)
  }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called with an argument of `true`, even if the `end` variable is `false`. This could cause the `done` callback to be called with an error, even if the stream has not actually failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function (end, data) {
