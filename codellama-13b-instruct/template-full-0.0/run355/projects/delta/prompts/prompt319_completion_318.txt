  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(Op.length(op));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the op, rather than just the retain attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(op.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the retain attribute of the op, rather than just the length of the op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(op.retain, AttributeMap.invert(op.attributes, baseOp.attributes));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the retain attribute of the op, as well as the inverted attributes of the op and the base op.

DONE.
