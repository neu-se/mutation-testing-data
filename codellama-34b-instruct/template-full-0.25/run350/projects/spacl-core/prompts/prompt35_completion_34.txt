  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is removed, causing the parts of the path to be processed in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(0)` method is used instead of `slice(1)`, causing the first part of the path to be processed instead of the last part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1, -1)` method is used instead of `slice(1)`, causing the first and last parts of the path to be excluded from processing.

DONE.
