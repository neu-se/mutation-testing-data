  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This will cause the `adjust` function to always round down to the nearest integer, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This will cause the `adjust` function to always round up to the nearest integer, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This will cause the `adjust` function to round to the nearest integer, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
