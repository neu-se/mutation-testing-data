  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the placeholder is replaced with `null`, which is a valid value for a callback function's `error` parameter, while `undefined` is not a valid value and would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the placeholder is replaced with `null`, which is a valid value for a callback function's `error` parameter, while "Error" is a string and would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error("Test error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the placeholder is replaced with `null`, which is a valid value for a callback function's `error` parameter, while the provided code would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
