  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === -0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true`, even if `b` is not equal to `-0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to only evaluate to `true` if `b` is equal to `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `b`.

DONE.
