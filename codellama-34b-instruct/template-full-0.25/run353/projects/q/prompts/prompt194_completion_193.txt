  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function expects a number as the second element of the array it returns, but `String` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function expects a non-null value as the second element of the array it returns, but `null` is a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function expects a defined value as the second element of the array it returns, but `undefined` is an undefined value.

DONE.
