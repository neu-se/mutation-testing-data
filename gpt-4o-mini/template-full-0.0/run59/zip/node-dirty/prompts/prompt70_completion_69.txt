Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an 'error' event instead of a 'load' event, which would mislead the consumers of this class into thinking an error occurred during loading instead of indicating that the loading process was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load_complete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'load_complete' event, which is not handled in the rest of the code, potentially causing confusion or missed event handling since the expected 'load' event is not emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'loaded'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a 'loaded' event instead of 'load', which may not be recognized by any listeners expecting the 'load' event, leading to a failure in notifying that the loading process has completed.

DONE.
