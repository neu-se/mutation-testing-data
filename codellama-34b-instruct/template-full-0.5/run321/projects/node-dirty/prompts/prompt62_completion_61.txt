  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Forced error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would destroy the write stream with a forced error, causing the `close` event to be emitted with an error, which would not happen in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would end the write stream and then destroy it, which would not happen in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Forced error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would destroy the write stream with a forced error, causing the `close` event to be emitted with an error, which would not happen in the original code.

DONE.
