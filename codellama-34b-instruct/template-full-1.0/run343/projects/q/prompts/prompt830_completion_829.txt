  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and using it as a method name would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument to `then` would cause the promise to be resolved with a value of `null`, rather than the original value of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function() { })
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a function as the first argument to `then` would cause the promise to be resolved with the return value of the function, rather than the original value of `this`.

DONE.
