  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression, so `!isPromise` would return `true` when `isPromise` is `false`, and `false` when `isPromise` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method, but it may not be a true promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` checks if the promise is in a pending state, meaning it has not been resolved or rejected yet.

DONE.
