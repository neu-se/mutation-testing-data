  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out deprecated timezones, while the new code fragment would include them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out deprecated timezones, while the new code fragment would include them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment filters out deprecated timezones, while the new code fragment would include them.

DONE.
