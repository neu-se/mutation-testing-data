  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the array is different, so a different value would be passed to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is not necessarily the same as the index of the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the `pull` function to throw an error, whereas the original code would pass the value of `ref[2]`.

DONE.
