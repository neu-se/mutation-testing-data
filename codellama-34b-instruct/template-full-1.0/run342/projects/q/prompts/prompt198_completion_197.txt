  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable is null or undefined, rather than if it is defined and has a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber.hasOwnProperty("fileName")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable has a property called "fileName".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber && !fileNameAndLineNumber.hasOwnProperty("fileName")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable is defined and has a property called "fileName".

DONE.
