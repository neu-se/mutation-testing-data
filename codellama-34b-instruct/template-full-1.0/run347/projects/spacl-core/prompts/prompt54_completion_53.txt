  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the extracted property name onto the `parts` array, rather than the original code which pushes the compiled regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the replaced part onto the `parts` array, rather than the original code which pushes the compiled regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')+')')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the replaced part plus a closing parentheses onto the `parts` array, rather than the original code which pushes the compiled regular expression.

DONE.
