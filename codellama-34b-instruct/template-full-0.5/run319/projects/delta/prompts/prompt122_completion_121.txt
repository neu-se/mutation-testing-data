  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof elem !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `elem` is an object, while this replacement checks if `elem` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof elem === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `elem` is an object, while this replacement checks if `elem` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof elem === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `elem` is an object, while this replacement checks if `elem` is undefined.

DONE.
