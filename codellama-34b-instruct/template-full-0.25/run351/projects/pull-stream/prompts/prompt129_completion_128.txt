  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new fragment calls it with two arguments. This could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior or cause it to fail if it is not designed to handle multiple arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `i` variable before calling the `cb` function, while this new fragment increments the `i` variable after calling the `cb` function. This could potentially cause issues with the function's behavior or cause it to fail if it is not designed to handle the incremented value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `i` variable before calling the `cb` function, while this new fragment decrements the `i
