Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the variable, which would not match the expected 'RegExp' or 'String' checks, leading to incorrect rule matching.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `rule[0]` is an instance of `Array`, which is not the intended check for determining if `rule[0]` is a `RegExp` or `String`, causing the pluralization logic to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[0]) === 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly classify all objects as valid rules, including those that are not `RegExp` or `String`, potentially leading to incorrect pluralization results.

DONE.
