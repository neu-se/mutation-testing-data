  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is only checking for the letter "I" instead of "i" or "I".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== 'i' && c !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is checking for the opposite condition (i.e., not "i" or "I") instead of "i" or "I".

DONE.
