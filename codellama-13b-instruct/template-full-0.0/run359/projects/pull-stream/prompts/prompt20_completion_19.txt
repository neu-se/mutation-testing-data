  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to `ref[0]` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from `ref[0]` would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by `ref[0]` would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
