  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always replace the first occurrence of the string, regardless of whether it is at the beginning of the content or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all occurrences of the string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/g, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the first occurrence of the string with a space character, rather than an empty string.

DONE.
