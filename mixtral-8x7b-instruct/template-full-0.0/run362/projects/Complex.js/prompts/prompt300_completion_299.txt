 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument of the `Math.cos()` function would always be negative, changing the sign of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, changing the result completely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness in the calculation, making the result unpredictable and inconsistent.

DONE.
