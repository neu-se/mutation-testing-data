 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>super)[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses TypeScript's type checking, allowing any property to be accessed on the super object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.getPrototypeOf(this)[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Object.getPrototypeOf()` to access the prototype of the current object, which may not always reference the same object as `super`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
RegExp.prototype[Symbol.match]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `RegExp.prototype` to access the `[Symbol.match]` method, which may not have the same behavior as the `[Symbol.match]` method of the specific `RegExp` instance created by the `Matcher` constructor.

DONE.
