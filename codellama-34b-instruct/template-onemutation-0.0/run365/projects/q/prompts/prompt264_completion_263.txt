  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value. If the code is replaced with `reject`, the promise will be rejected instead of fulfilled, which could cause the program to behave differently.
