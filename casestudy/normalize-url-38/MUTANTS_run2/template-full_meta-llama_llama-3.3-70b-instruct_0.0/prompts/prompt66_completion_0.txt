Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!opts.stripWWW && /^www\.([a-z\-\d]{2,63})\.([a-z\.]{2,5})$/.test(urlObj.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the condition, so `www.` would be removed when `opts.stripWWW` is `false`, instead of when it's `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opts.stripWWW && /^www\.([a-z\-\d]{1,63})\.([a-z\.]{1,5})$/.test(urlObj.hostname)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now allows for shorter domain name components (minimum length of 1 instead of 2), which could lead to incorrect removal of `www.` from hostnames that don't meet the original criteria.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
opts.stripWWW && urlObj.hostname.startsWith('www.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method checks for a literal prefix, without considering the rest of the hostname,
