  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` would create a new URL object based on the `parsedBaseUrl` and `parsedUrl` instead of parsing the `currentUrlStr` as `URL.parse` would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(parsedBaseUrl.href)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parsedBaseUrl.href` would return the href of the base URL instead of the URL string that was parsed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(URL.resolve(baseUrl, parsedUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` would create a new URL object based on the `baseUrl` and `parsedUrl` instead of parsing the `currentUrlStr` as `URL.parse` would.

DONE.
