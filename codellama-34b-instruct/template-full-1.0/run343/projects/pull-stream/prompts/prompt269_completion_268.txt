  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is a negated version of `end`, which would cause the `if(end)` block to evaluate to `false` even if `end` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `end`, which would cause the `if(end)` block to evaluate to `false` even if `end` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `end`, which would cause the `if(end)` block to evaluate to `false` even if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
