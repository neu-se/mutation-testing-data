  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result if `country` is `undefined` instead of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `undefined`, and the function would return a different result if `country` is `null` instead of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because `!country.timezones` is a different condition than `!country`, and the function would return a different result if `country.timezones` is falsy instead of `country` itself.

DONE.
