  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine, which is different from the sine returned by `Math.sin`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine, which is different from the cosine returned by `Math.cos`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent, which is different from the tangent returned by `Math.tan`. The negative sign in front of `Math.tanh` would also change the sign of the result.

DONE.
