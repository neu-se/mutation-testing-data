  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.retain)
```
This code fragment filters the `ops` array to only include elements that have a `retain` property, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.delete)
```
This code fragment filters the `ops` array to only include elements that have a `delete` property, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter(op => op.insert)
```
This code fragment filters the `ops` array to only include elements that have an `insert` property, which is the opposite of the original code fragment.

DONE.
