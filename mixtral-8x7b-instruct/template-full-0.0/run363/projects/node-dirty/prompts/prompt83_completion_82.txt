 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence. This change could cause issues if there are multiple occurrences of '\n' in the `chunk`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('')
