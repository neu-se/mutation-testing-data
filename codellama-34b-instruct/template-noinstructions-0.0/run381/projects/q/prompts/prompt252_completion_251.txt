  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is used to create a new function that, when called, will have a specific `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is used to call a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promiseDispatch.apply
