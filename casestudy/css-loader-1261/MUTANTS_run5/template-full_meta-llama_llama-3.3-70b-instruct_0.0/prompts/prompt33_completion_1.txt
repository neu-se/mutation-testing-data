Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
encodeURI(normalizedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `encodeURI` is used instead of `decodeURI`, which would change the way special characters are handled in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(normalizedUrl) + "?mutated"
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional query parameter `?mutated` is appended to the URL, which could affect how the URL is processed downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `url` is used instead of the `normalizedUrl`, which could lead to differences in how the URL is decoded and processed.

DONE.
