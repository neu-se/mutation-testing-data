  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is a different property from `options.dest`, and the code is expecting a file path in `options.dest`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting a file path in `options.dest`, but `toLowerCase()` would return a lowercase version of the file path, which could cause issues if the file path contains uppercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(options.dest, '..')
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join()` would return a file path that is one level higher than the original file path in `options.dest`.

DONE.
