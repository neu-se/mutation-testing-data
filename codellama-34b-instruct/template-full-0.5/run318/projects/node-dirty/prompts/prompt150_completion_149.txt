  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object as an argument to the callback function, while the new code fragment passes `null` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object as an argument to the callback function, while the new code fragment passes a different error object as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Different error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a different error object as an argument to the callback function.

DONE.
