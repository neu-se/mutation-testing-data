  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games, illnesses, misc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `tools.concat`, which concatenates the elements of the `tools` array with the elements of the `clothes` array, while the new code fragment concatenates the elements of the `clothes` array with the elements of the `games`, `illnesses`, and `misc` arrays.

DONE.
