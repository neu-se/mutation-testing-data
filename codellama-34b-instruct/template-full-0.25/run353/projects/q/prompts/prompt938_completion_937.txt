  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be sliced starting from the third argument, instead of the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments), 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called on the `arguments` object, which would create a new array with the same elements as `arguments`, and then the `2` would be used as the second argument to `array_slice`, which would return a new array with the first two elements of the original `arguments` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1), 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called on the `arguments` object starting from the second element, and then the `2` would be used as the second argument to `array_slice`, which would return a new array with
