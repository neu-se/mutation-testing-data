Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a value to be passed to `callback.fcall()`, and passing `undefined` would lead to an error when trying to invoke the callback, potentially causing the promise to not resolve as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `callback.fcall()` may not trigger the callback correctly, depending on how `fcall` is implemented, which could lead to unexpected behavior or a failure to execute the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unexpected value"
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like "unexpected value" to `callback.fcall()` may cause the callback to behave incorrectly if it is not designed to handle string inputs, leading to potential errors or incorrect promise resolution.

DONE.
