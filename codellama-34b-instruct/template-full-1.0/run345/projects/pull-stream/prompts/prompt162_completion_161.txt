  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `true` instead of `false` if `value` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would call the callback with `value` as the second argument instead of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Invalid argument'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would call the callback with an error instead of the expected return value.

DONE.
