  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `!abort` will always be `false` if `abort` is `true`, which means the loop will never terminate if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` will always be `true` if `end` is `true`, which means the loop will never terminate if `end` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` will always be `true` if `end` is `false`, which means the loop will never terminate if `end` is `false`.

DONE.
