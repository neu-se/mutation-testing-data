  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the start and end of the text, whereas the modified code fragment uses `split()` to split the text into an array of words, `reverse()` to reverse the order of the words, and `join()` to join the words back together with spaces in between. This would result in the text being reversed, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().replace(/ /g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove whitespace from the start and end of the text, whereas the modified code fragment uses `replace()` to remove all spaces from the text. This would result in the text being condensed into a single word, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
