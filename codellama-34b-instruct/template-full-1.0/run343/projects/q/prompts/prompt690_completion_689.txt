  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` as the value for the first argument, while this code uses `this`, which could potentially refer to a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[promise, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` as the value for the first argument, while this code uses `promise`, which could potentially be a different promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[object, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `void 0` as the value for the first argument, while this code uses `object`, which could potentially be a different object.

DONE.
