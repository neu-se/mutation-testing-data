  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different expression than `a - b`, and it would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a * b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is a different expression than `a - b`, and it would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a / b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `a / b` is a different expression than `a - b`, and it would cause the `parser_exit` function to be called with a different argument.

DONE.
