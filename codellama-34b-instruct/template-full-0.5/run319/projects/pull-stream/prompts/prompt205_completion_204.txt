  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the `end` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `end` variable is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the `end` variable by 1, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a different set of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the `end` variable by 1, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` for a different set of values.

DONE.
