  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let policy;
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` creates a new variable called `policy`, whereas `const` does not. This would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the newly created variable, rather than the original `policies` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (policy of policies.reverse()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the `policies` array, causing the `for...of` loop to iterate over the elements in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (; policy = policies.shift();) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element from the `policies` array, causing the `for...of` loop to iterate over the remaining elements.

DONE.
