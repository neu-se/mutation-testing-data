  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting object would have the same properties as `a`, but with the values of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting object would have no properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting object would have random properties and values.

DONE.
