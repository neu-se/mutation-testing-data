  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0 || !isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `c` is a valid number, then the test expression would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the current values of `plus` and `minus`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1 || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `plus` and `minus` are non-zero, then the test expression would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the current value of `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === Infinity || isNaN(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `plus` and `minus` are infinite, then the test expression would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the current value of `c`.

DONE.
