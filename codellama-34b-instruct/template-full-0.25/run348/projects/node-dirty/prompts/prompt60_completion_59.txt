  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close()` method to destroy the write stream instead of the read stream, which could lead to data loss or corruption.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close()` method to destroy the read stream before it has a chance to finish reading the file, which could lead to incomplete or corrupted data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close()` method to end the write stream before it has a chance to finish writing to the file, which could lead to incomplete or corrupted data.

DONE.
