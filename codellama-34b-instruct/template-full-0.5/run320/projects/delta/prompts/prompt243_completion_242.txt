  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = thisIter.peekLength() - length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the length of the next operation in the iterator, while this replacement code calculates the remaining length of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = otherIter.peekLength() - length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the length of the next operation in the other iterator, while this replacement code calculates the remaining length of the current operation in the other iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const opLength = length - thisIter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the length of the current operation in the iterator, while this replacement code calculates the difference between the length of the current operation and the remaining length of the iterator.

DONE.
