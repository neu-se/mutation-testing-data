  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error when `pull.apply` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, and would not have a `source` property, which is required for the `pull` function to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and would not have a `source` property, which is required for the `pull` function to work correctly.

DONE.
