  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[2]
```
This change will cause the `progressListeners` array to be populated with the wrong value, leading to incorrect behavior when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[0]
```
This change will cause the `progressListeners` array to be populated with the wrong value, leading to incorrect behavior when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === "when" && operands[3]
```
This change will cause the `progressListeners` array to be populated with the wrong value, leading to incorrect behavior when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
