  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `shouldThrow` is `true`. This would cause the `err.message` to be set to `${file}: ${err.message}` and the `err` to be thrown, even if `shouldThrow` is `false`.

DONE.
