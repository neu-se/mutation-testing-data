  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, undefined, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument, which is expected to be the `abort` value, would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument, which is expected to be the `abort` value, would be set to `null`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, true, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument, which is expected to be the `abort` value, would be set to `true`, which would cause the function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
