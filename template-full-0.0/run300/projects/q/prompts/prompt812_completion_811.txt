  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called twice, which would cause the rejection to be thrown twice, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).catch(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used instead of `then`, which would cause the rejection to be caught and handled differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return value;
}).finally(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used instead of `then`, which would cause the rejection to be thrown after
