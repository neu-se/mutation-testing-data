  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` as the first argument instead of `data`, which could potentially cause issues if the code is relying on the return value of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` as the first argument instead of `data`, which could potentially cause issues if the code is relying on the return value of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `data` as the first argument and `null` as the second argument, which could potentially cause issues if the code is relying on the return value of the function.

DONE.
