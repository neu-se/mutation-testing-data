  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 360` would cause the resulting angle to always be positive, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the resulting angle to be twice as large, which would change the direction of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 180` would cause the resulting angle to be 180 degrees different from the original, which would change the direction of the bearing.

DONE.
