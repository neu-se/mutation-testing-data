 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function call is replaced with an immediate resolution, which might not allow the timeout functionality to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function call is replaced with an immediate resolution using the native `Promise.resolve()`, which might not allow the timeout functionality to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` treats its argument as a promise and immediately resolves it, which might not allow the timeout functionality to work correctly.

DONE.
