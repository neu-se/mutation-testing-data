  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at `1`, instead of `0`, and would miss the first element of the `tokens` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would continue indefinitely, because the value of `i` is always incremented by `1`, but never reassigned to `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last element of the `tokens` array, instead of the first, and would iterate over the elements in reverse order.

DONE.
