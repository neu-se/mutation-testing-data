  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with `arguments` as the first argument, which would result in the entire argument list being included in the slice, rather than just the first two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with `arguments` as the first argument, which would result in an empty array being returned, rather than just the first two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would result in an error being thrown, rather than just the first two arguments.

DONE.
