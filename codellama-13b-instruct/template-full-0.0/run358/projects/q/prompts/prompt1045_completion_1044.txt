  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `head` property of the `ends` deferred object, rather than the `tail` property as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `tail` property of the `ends` deferred object, rather than the `head` property as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"head.tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the value of the `tail` property of the `head` property of the `ends` deferred object, rather than the `head` property as in the original code.

DONE.
