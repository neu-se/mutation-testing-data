  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is used to handle the resolution of a promise, while the original code used the `dispatch` method to perform a function call on the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is used to handle the rejection of a promise, while the original code used the `dispatch` method to perform a function call on the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is used to perform a function call on the resolved value, regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected.

DONE.
