  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This change will cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This change will cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['ZERO']` when the divisor is zero, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'] && z['re'] === 0
```
This change will cause the `mul` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero and the real part of the dividend is zero, which is incorrect.

DONE.
