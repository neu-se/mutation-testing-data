  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the accumulator, current value, and current index as arguments, instead of the accumulator, current value, and initial value as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the accumulator and current value as arguments, instead of the accumulator, current value, and initial value as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(accum, curr, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with the accumulator, current value, and current index plus one as arguments, instead of the accumulator, current value, and initial value as in the original code.

DONE.
