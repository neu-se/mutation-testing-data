  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise with the error message "error", regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("progress")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always notify the promise with the progress message "progress", regardless of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the value `null`, regardless of the promise's state.

DONE.
