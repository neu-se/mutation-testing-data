  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 + atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a different value to `λ1`, potentially leading to a wrong calculation of the destination point's longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 - atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract a different value from `λ1`, potentially leading to a wrong calculation of the destination point's longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1 * atan2(y, x);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `λ1` by a different value, potentially leading to a wrong calculation of the destination point's longitude.

DONE.
