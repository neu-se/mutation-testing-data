  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` variable, while the new code fragment resolves to the value `42`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` variable, while the new code fragment resolves to the string `"hello world"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a promise that resolves to the value of the `object` variable, while the new code fragment rejects with the error string `"error"`.

DONE.
