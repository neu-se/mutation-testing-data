 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a null error, indicating successful completion, even if the `map` function encounters an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error(' unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with an unexpected error, even if the `map` function completes successfully.

DONE.
