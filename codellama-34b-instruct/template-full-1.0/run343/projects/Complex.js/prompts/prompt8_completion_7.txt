  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinh` function to always return `0` for any input `x`, which would break the `cosm1` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinh` function to always return `0` for any input `x`, which would break the `cosm1` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinh` function to always return a positive value, which would change the behavior of the `cosm1` function.

DONE.
