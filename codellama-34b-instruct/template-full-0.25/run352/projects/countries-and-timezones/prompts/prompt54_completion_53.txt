  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.filter(t => t.deprecated)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns all timezones, while this new code fragment only returns deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.map(t => t.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values, while this new code fragment returns an array of timezone names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezones.reduce((acc, t) => acc + t.offset, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an object with timezone names as keys and timezone objects as values, while this new code fragment returns the total offset of all timezones.

DONE.
