Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the `next` method to consume only one unit of the operation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the remaining operations in the `other` Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the `thisIter` iterator instead of the `otherIter`, which could lead to unexpected results by consuming operations from the wrong Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because calling `next(0)` may not advance the iterator at all, effectively skipping the operation and potentially causing the composition to miss important changes from the `other` Delta.

DONE.
