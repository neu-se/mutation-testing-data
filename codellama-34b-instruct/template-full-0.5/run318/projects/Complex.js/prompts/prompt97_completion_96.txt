  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(tokens[i + 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would not exit the parser if the next token was a number, but the modified code would exit the parser in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would add the next token to the real part of the complex number, but the modified code would set the real part to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would add the next token to the imaginary part of the complex number, but the modified code would set the imaginary part to zero.

DONE.
