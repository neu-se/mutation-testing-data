  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to remove one extra character from the word, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to add an extra character to the word, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to double the length of the word, potentially resulting in an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
