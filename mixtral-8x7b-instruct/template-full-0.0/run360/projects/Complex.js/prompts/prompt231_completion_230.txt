 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part of the result is flipped, which can cause significant changes in the complex plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the result is always 0, which is incorrect when the input has a non-zero imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the result now has a random component, which is unlikely to be the intended behavior and can cause unpredictable results.

DONE.
