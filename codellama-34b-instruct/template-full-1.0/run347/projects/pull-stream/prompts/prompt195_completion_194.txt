  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting a Error object but now it will receive a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting an Error object but now it will receive null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was expecting an Error object but now it will receive an empty object.

DONE.
