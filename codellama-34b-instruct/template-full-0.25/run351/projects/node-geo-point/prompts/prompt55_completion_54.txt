  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the latitude of the first point, which could result in a different bearing value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ1` is the longitude of the first point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `λ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the bearing calculation to be based on the longitude of the first point, which could result in a different bearing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `λ2` is the longitude of the second point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `λ2` instead of `
