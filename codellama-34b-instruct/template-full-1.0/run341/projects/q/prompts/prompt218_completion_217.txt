  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unexpected error")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Promise to be rejected with the given error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the Promise would be fulfilled with the value `42` instead of the value `14`.

DONE.
