  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezonesMap` is called with the `data` argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment `getTimezonesMap`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezonesMap` is called with two arguments, `data` and `id`, which is not the same as the original code fragment `getTimezonesMap`. This could cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data, id, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getTimezonesMap` is called with three arguments, `data
