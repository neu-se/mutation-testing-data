  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the callback with the data, it will call the callback with the ended flag, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the callback with the data, it will call the callback with the error flag, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the callback with the data, it will call the callback with the doubled data, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
