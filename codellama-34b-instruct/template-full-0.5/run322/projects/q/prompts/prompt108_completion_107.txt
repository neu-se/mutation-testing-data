  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or access out-of-bounds array elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the array, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or access out-of-bounds array elements.

DONE.
