  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `a` is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is incremented by 1, which would change the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is multiplied by 2, which would change the result of the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
