  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.iter.next(other.iter.next(index))
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the same index twice, which could potentially cause the iteration to become stuck in an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.iter.next(other.iter.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the entire length of the other iterator, which could cause the iteration to become stuck on the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.iter.next(other.iter.next(index) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the same index plus one, which could cause the iteration to become stuck on the following element.

DONE.
