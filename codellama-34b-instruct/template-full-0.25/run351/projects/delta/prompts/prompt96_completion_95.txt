  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would insert the new op at the wrong index, causing the operation to be applied to the wrong element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would insert the new op at the wrong index, causing the operation to be applied to the wrong element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would insert the new op at the wrong index, causing the operation to be applied to the wrong element in the array.

DONE.
