  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string "(node.js:", which could be a false positive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` only for stack lines that contain the string "(node.js:)" exactly, which could be a false negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` only for stack lines that contain the string "(node.js:)" exactly, which could be a false negative.

DONE.
