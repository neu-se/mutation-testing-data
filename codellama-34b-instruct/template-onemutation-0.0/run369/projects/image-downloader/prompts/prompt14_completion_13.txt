  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `decodeURIComponent` to decode the basename, but this new code fragment uses `toLowerCase` to convert the decoded basename to lowercase. This could cause the code to behave differently if the basename contains uppercase characters.

DONE.
