  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will create a rejected promise, whereas `Q` will create a resolved promise. This change would cause the `continuer` function to return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, which would propagate the rejection to the `errback` function and potentially cause the generator to throw an error.
