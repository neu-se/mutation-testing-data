 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect()` method would not be called on the promise, and the `promise` object would not be replaced with its resolved value. This could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the resolved values in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise()` check would return false, and the `snapshot` variable would not be assigned. As a result, the `promises[index]` would not be replaced with the resolved value, which could lead to unexpected behavior when processing the resolved values in the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
