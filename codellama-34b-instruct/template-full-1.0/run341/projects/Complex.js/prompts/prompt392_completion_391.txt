  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `b`, while the replaced code fragment logs the negative value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs the value of `b`, while the replaced code fragment logs the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment logs a constant value of `b`, while the replaced code fragment logs a random value generated by the `Math.random()` function.

DONE.
