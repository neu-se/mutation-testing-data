  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be called instead of the original function, which would change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
