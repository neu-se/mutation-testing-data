  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of calculating the bearing, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(x) + Math.abs(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the absolute values of x and y instead of using the arctangent function, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies x and y instead of using the arctangent function, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

DONE.
