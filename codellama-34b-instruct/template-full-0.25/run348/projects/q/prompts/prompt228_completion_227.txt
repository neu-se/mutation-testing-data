  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.push(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `args` array onto the `messages` array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the `args` array as its first argument, rather than the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.concat(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `args` array onto the `messages` array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the concatenated array as its first argument, rather than the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `args` array from the `messages` array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called with the sliced array as its first argument, rather than the `
