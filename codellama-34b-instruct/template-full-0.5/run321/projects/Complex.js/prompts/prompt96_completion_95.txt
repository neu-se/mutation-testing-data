  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would exit the parser immediately, without completing the rest of the parsing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a `NaN` value, which would be interpreted as a invalid or undefined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Invalid input');
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would throw an error, indicating that the input is invalid or unexpected.

DONE.
