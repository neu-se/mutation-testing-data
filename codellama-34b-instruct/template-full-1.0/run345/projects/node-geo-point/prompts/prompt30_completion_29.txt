  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the distance between the two points using the Haversine formula, while this replacement code calculates the distance based on the longitude difference between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes the longitude values are in degrees, while this replacement code assumes they are in radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 0.01745
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code assumes the longitude values are in degrees, while this replacement code assumes they are in degrees multiplied by a constant (0.01745).

DONE.
