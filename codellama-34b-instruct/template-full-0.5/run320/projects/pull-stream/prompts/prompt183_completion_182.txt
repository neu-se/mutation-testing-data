  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this replacement checks if `i` is strictly greater than `array.length`. This means that the replacement would return `true` for one more iteration than the original code, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than 0. This means that the replacement would return `true` for all iterations where `i` is negative, which could result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `array.length`, while this replacement checks
