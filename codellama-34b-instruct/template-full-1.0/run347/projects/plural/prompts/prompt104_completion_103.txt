  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return w + 's'"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original word unchanged, while this new code fragment appends an 's' to the word, resulting in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return w + 'es'"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original word unchanged, while this new code fragment appends an 'es' to the word, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"return w + 'ies'"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original word unchanged, while this new code fragment appends an 'ies' to the word, resulting in a different output.

DONE.
