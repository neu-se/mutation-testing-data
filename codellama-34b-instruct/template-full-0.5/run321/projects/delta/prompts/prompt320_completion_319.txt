  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.delete` would refer to the `delete` property of the `op` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` would refer to the `retain` property of the `op` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` would refer to the `insert` property of the `op` object, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
