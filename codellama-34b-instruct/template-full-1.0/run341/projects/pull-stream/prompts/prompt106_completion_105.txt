  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done()
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` as a function call would execute the `done` callback whereas `done` as a variable references the callback itself. The test may not be able to detect the difference between the two and may not effectively test the `onEnd` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause the `drain` function to throw an error, whereas the original `done` callback is a function and would not cause an error. The test may not be able to detect this difference and may not effectively test the `onEnd` function in the presence of errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not have the same effect as the original `done` callback, and the test may not be able to detect this difference and may not effectively test the `onEnd` function
