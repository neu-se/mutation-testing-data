  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `false`, but this replacement checks for `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `false`, but this replacement checks for any value that is not `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `false`, but this replacement checks for any value that is not truthy.

DONE.
