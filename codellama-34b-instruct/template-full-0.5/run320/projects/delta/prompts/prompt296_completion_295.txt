  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push(otherOp)` would push the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array, whereas the original code `delta.push(otherOp.retain)` would push the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push(thisOp)` would push the `thisOp` object onto the `delta` array, whereas the original code `delta.push(otherOp.retain)` would push the `retain` property of the `otherOp` object onto the `delta` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

delta.push(otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push(otherOp.retain)` would push the `retain
