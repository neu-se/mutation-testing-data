  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the return value of `otherIter.rest()`, which is an array of indexes, to create a new `Delta` object. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with 0 would cause the code to create a new `Delta` object with an empty array, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the return value of `otherIter.rest()`, which is an array of indexes, to create a new `Delta` object. Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with an empty array would cause the code to create a new `Delta` object with no indexes, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...otherIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the return value of `otherIter.rest()`, which is an array of
