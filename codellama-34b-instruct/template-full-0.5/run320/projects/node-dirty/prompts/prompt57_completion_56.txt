  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is not emitted when the queue is empty, so the `close` method would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_close` event is not emitted when the queue is empty, so the `close` method would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_close` event is not emitted when the queue is empty, so the `close` method would not be called.

DONE.
