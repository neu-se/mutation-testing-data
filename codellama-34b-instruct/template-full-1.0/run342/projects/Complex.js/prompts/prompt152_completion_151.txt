  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return Infinity, regardless of whether the base is Infinite or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only return Infinity if the base is greater than 0, instead of if it is Infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to only return Infinity if the base is not Infinite, instead of if it is Infinite.

DONE.
