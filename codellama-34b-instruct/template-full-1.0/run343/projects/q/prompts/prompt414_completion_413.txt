  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value * 2; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function multiplies the input value by 2, rather than checking if it is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function adds 1 to the input value, rather than checking if it is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return !value; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns the logical negation of the input value, rather than checking if it is a promise-like object.

DONE.
