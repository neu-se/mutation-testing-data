  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'people'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "person" to refer to a single individual, while the new code fragment uses the word "people" to refer to multiple individuals.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'humans'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "person" to refer to a single individual, while the new code fragment uses the word "humans" to refer to multiple individuals.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the word "person" to refer to a single individual, while the new code fragment uses the word "individuals" to refer to multiple individuals.

DONE.
