  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejected` function, while the buggy code fragment is a string literal. This would cause the `then` method to throw an error, as it would be trying to call a string as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejected` function, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `Q.rejected` function. This would cause the `then` method to return a rejected promise, as it would be calling the `Q.rejected` function instead of the `rejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.rejected(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `rejected` function, while the
