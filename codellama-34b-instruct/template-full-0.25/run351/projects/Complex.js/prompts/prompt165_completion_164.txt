  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a property access, while this new code fragment is a function call. The function call would return a value, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a property access, while this new code fragment is a function call. The function call would return a value, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.
