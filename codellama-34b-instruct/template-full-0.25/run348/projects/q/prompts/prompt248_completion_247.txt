  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified value, whereas `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, but then subtract 1 from it, which would result in a different slice of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the substring starting from the first occurrence of the specified value, rather than starting from the second occurrence.

DONE.
