 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `==` equality operator instead of the `===` strict equality operator, which may produce false positives due to type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows the base to be zero, which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it requires the base to be strictly greater than zero, which is not the case in the original code fragment.

DONE.
