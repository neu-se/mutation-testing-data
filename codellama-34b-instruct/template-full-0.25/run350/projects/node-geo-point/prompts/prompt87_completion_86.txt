  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation is incorrect. The `sinφ2` calculation should use the `sinδ` value instead of `cosδ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation is incorrect. The `+ 1` term is not necessary and would cause the calculation to be off.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ + sinφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ2` calculation is incorrect. The `sinφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ` term is not necessary and would
