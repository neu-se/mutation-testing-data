  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'], temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause errors in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1, temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, which could cause errors in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * 2, temp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the real part of the complex number, which could cause errors in the subsequent calculations.

DONE.
