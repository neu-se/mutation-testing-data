  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the absolute value of x, while the new code fragment is using the negative value of x.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the absolute value of x, while the new code fragment is using twice the value of x.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the absolute value of x, while the new code fragment is using half the value of x.

DONE.
