Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate, initialValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the initial value by adding 1, which would lead to an incorrect accumulation of values during the reduction process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate, initialValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the initial value by 2, which would skew the final result of the reduction, potentially doubling the expected output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the initial value to 0, which would ignore any previous accumulated values and always start the reduction from zero, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
