  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is accessed at a different index, which could lead to a different value being passed to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is accessed at a different index, which could lead to a different value being passed to the `pull` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element from the `ref` array, which could lead to a different value being passed to the `pull` function.

DONE.
