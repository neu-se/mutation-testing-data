 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `exp` method would be offset by a constant value, which would affect the accuracy of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the `exp` method would be a random value, rather than the exponential of the real part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number would be replaced with the imaginary part, which would affect the accuracy of the result.

DONE.
