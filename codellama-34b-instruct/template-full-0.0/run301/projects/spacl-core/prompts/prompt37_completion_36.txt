  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called on the array returned by `slice()`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than reversing the order of the characters in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join()` method is being called on the array returned by `slice()`, which would concatenate the elements of the array into a single string, rather than reversing the order of the characters in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).map(x => x.split('').reverse().join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method is being called on the array returned by `slice()`, which would apply the function `x => x.split('').reverse().
