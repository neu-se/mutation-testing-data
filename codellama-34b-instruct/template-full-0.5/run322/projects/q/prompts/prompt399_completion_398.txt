  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a new promise that is already resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides methods for creating and manipulating promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a new promise that is already rejected, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides methods for creating and manipulating promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a new promise that resolves when all of the input promises have resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides methods for creating and manipulating promises.

DONE.
