  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === null ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === undefined ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is `true`, but this replacement checks if it's `undefined`.

DONE.
