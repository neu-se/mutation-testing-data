  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect` is a method of the `Promise` class, but it is not called on the `promise` object in the original code fragment. Calling `inspect` on the `promise` object would result in a different value being returned, which would cause the `allSettled` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that returns `undefined`, but the original code fragment does not return `undefined`. The `allSettled` method would behave differently if the `promise` object resolved to a value other than `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) { return value; }, function (reason) { throw reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the
