  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to skip every other line in the document, which may cause issues with the application's functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to start counting lines from 1 instead of 0, which may cause issues with the application's functionality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1
```
This change will cause the `eachLine` method to count lines backwards, which may cause issues with the application's functionality.

DONE.
