  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` when it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` when it is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress).then(function () {
    return promise;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` when it is fulfilled or rejected, and the returned promise would not be the same as the original `promise`.

DONE.
