  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue` is a Map object that stores the key-value pairs to be written to the database, while `this._data` is a Map object that stores the in-memory cache of the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the `this._data` Map object, while `this._data` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the `this._data` Map object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the `this._data` Map object, while `this._data` returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the `this._data` Map object.

DONE.
