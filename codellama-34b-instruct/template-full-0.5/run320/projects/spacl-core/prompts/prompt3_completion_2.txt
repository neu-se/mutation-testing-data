  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match multiple times in the input string, whereas the original regex would only match once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match case-insensitively, whereas the original regex would only match case-sensitively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `s` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match across multiple lines in the input string,
