  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` would return the value of the `input` variable, while `input + 1` would return the value of the `input` variable plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` would return the value of the `input` variable, while `input - 1` would return the value of the `input` variable minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `input` would return the value of the `input` variable, while `input * 2` would return the value of the `input` variable multiplied by 2.

DONE.
