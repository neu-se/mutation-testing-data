  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is used to calculate the `dstOffsetStr` property, which is a string representation of the daylight saving time offset. By adding 1 to the `dstOffset` value, the resulting string would be different, and the test would fail if it relies on the correct calculation of the `dstOffsetStr` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` variable is used to calculate the `dstOffsetStr` property, which is a string representation of the daylight saving time offset. By multiplying the `dstOffset` value by 2, the resulting string would be different, and the test would fail if it relies on the correct calculation of the `dstOffsetStr` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the
