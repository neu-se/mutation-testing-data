Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(a, b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` converts the input to an integer, potentially losing decimal values, while the original `parse` function likely handles floating-point numbers correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z = { re: a, im: b };
```
This would result in different behavior because this code initializes `z` as an object with properties `re` and `im` directly from `a` and `b`, rather than parsing them, which may lead to incorrect initialization of complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z = new Complex(b, a);
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the parameters when creating a new `Complex` object, which would result in the real and imaginary parts being assigned incorrectly.

DONE.
