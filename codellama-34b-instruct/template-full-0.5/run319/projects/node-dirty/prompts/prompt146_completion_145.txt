  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'error'` is a different event than `'drain'`, and it would trigger a different set of callbacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'end'` is a different event than `'drain'`, and it would trigger a different set of callbacks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'close'` is a different event than `'drain'`, and it would trigger a different set of callbacks.

DONE.
