  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key, val)
```
This change will cause the `JSON.stringify` method to be called with two arguments, `key` and `val`, instead of one argument, which is the object to be stringified. This will result in a different string being generated, which may or may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(key)
```
This change will cause the `JSON.stringify` method to be called with only one argument, `key`, instead of two arguments. This will result in a different string being generated, which may or may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(val)
```
This change will cause the `JSON.stringify` method to be called with only one argument, `val`, instead of two arguments. This will result in a different string being generated, which may or may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
