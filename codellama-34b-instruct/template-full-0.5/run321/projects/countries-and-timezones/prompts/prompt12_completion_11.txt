  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.assign()` method would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to a different object being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.assign()` method would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to a different object being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.assign()` method would not be called with the correct arguments, leading to a different object being returned.

DONE.
