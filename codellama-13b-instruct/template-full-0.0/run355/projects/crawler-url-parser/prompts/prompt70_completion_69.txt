  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cheerio.load()` method takes a string as an argument, while the original code fragment takes a DOM element as an argument. This could cause the code to behave differently if the input data is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { decodeEntities: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option is set to `false` in the new code fragment, while it is not set in the original code fragment. This could cause the code to behave differently if the input data contains HTML entities.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.load(data, { xmlMode: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option is set to `true` in the new code fragment, while it is not set in the original code fragment. This could cause
