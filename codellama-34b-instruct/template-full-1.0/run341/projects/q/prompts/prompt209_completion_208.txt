  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
LOGGER.info("Hello World!")
```
This would result in different behavior because `LOGGER.info()` would log a message to the console, but the original code fragment `callback` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys({"key1": "value1"})[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` would return an array of keys in an object, but the original code fragment `callback` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "Hello World!";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a string, but the original code fragment `callback` would not.

DONE.
