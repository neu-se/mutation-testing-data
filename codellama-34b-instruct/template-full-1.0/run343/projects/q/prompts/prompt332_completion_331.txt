  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(deferred.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a circular reference, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("failed");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the reason "failed", instead of resolving it with the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the value, instead of resolving it with the value.

DONE.
