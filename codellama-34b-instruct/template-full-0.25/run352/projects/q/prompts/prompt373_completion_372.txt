  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the `Q.onerror` function from being called, which could potentially cause unhandled errors to be silently ignored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` function with a no-op function, which would prevent any error handling from occurring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` function with a function that throws any errors that occur, which could potentially cause the program to crash.

DONE.
