  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, which would cause the first element of the array to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the array instead of the first, which would cause the first (length - 1) elements to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the array plus 1, which would cause the first (length) elements to be skipped.

DONE.
