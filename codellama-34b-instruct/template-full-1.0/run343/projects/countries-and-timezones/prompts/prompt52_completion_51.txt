  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.countries` and `data.timezones` are different properties in the `data` object, and the code fragment is expecting the latter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the object, while the original code fragment was expecting an object with properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry(id)` is a function that returns a country object based on the given id, while the original code fragment was expecting an object with properties.

DONE.
