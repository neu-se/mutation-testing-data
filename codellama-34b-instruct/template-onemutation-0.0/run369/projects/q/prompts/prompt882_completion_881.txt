  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `fail` is a method that is called when the promise is rejected. Using `done` instead of `fail` would cause the promise to be resolved even if the function passed to `Q.nfapply` throws an error, which would result in a different behavior.

DONE.
