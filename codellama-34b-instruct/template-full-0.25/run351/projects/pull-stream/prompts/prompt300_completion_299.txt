  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is the opposite of `ended`, so the test would pass even if the stream has not ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is always true, so the test would always pass regardless of whether the stream has ended or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is always false, so the test would always fail regardless of whether the stream has ended or not.

DONE.
