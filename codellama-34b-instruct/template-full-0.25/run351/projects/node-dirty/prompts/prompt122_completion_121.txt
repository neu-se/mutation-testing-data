  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, while the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, while the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed, while the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained.

DONE.
