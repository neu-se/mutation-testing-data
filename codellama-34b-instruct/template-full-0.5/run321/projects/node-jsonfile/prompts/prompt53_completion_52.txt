  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, value) => value
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacer function is not being used to modify the JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, value) => value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacer function is modifying the JSON string by adding 1 to every value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(key, value) => value.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacer function is modifying the JSON string by converting every value to uppercase.

DONE.
