Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` modifies the original array and returns the removed elements, while `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array without modifying the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat(other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining `this.ops` and `other.ops`, which may lead to unexpected results if the intention was to only use `this.ops`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, which is unnecessary and could lead to performance issues compared to simply slicing the array.

DONE.
