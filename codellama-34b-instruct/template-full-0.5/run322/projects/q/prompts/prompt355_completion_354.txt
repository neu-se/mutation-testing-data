  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Exception("New exception message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new exception with a different message is thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Exception("New exception message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a new exception with a different message is thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(new Exception("New exception message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new exception with a different message is resolved, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

DONE.
