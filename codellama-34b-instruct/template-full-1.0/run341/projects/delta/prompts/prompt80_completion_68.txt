  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(lastOp != null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if `lastOp` is not null, regardless of the type of `lastOp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(typeof lastOp !== 'undefined')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if `lastOp` is defined, regardless of its type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(lastOp.hasOwnProperty('insert'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true if `lastOp` has an `insert` property, regardless of the value of `lastOp`.

DONE.
