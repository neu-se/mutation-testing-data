  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!end` operator would always return `false` if `end` is a boolean value, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` if `end` is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return the second operand if the first operand is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would return the first operand if the first operand is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return the first operand if the first operand is truthy, whereas the original code fragment would return the second operand if the second operand is truthy.

DONE.
