  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl == "NaN"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this alternative checks if it is literally the string "NaN".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl !== "NaN"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this alternative checks if it is not literally the string "NaN".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `linkurl` is a string, while this alternative checks if it is null.
DONE.
