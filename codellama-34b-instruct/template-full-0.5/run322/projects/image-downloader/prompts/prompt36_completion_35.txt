  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'` instead of the default `'w'`, which means that the file is opened in append mode instead of write mode. This could cause the file to be overwritten instead of appended to, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf16' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf16'` instead of the default `'utf8'`, which means that the file is written using UTF-16 encoding instead of UTF-8. This could cause issues with non-ASCII characters, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { mode: '0777' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` option is
