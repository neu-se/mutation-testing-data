  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments to `then` is reversed, causing the rejection handler to be called instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, onUnhandledError, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `void 0` is added as the first argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError, void 0, void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `void 0` is added as the second argument to `then`, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError` instead of being fulfilled.

DONE.
