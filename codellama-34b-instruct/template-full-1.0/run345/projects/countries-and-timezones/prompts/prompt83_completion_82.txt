  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(c.id, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with the `id` property of the country object, whereas the original code fragment only called `getCountry` with the country object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(c.name, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with the `name` property of the country object, whereas the original code fragment only called `getCountry` with the country object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with the country object and an options object with the `deprecated` property set to `true` (the original code fragment did not include any options object).

DONE.
