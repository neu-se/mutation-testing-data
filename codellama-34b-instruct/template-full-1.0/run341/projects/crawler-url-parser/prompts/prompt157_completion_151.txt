  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/(\/[^\/]+$)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is only matching a single character (`$`) at the end of the path, whereas the original code fragment is matching any number of characters (`*`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is replacing all forward slashes (`/`) in the path with nothing, whereas the original code fragment is only replacing the last forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/\//g, /([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is replacing all forward slashes (`/`) in the path with any number of alphanumeric characters, whereas the original code fragment is only replacing the last forward slash.

DONE.
