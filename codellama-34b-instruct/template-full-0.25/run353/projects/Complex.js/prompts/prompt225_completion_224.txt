  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is equal to 0. This would cause the code to take a different branch in the `if` statement, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if the absolute value of `b` is greater than 0. This would cause the code to
