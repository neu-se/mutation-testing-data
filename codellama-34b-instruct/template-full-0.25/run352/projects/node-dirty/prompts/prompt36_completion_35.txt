  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `this._data` map using the `for...of` loop, which would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the map's keys and values in a different order than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `this._data` map using the `entries()` method, which would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the map's keys and values in a different order than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `this._data` map using the `values()` method, which would cause the `
