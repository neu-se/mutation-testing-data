  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is a different operator than `type`, and would return a string indicating the type of the object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different way of getting the type of an object, and would return a string indicating the type of the object, rather than the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different way of getting the type of an object, and would return a string indicating the type of the object, rather than the object itself.

DONE.
