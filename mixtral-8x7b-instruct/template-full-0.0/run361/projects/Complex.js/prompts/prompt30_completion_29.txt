 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of `b` when it is negative, which can lead to incorrect results or errors in the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root of the absolute value of `b`, which is not the same as taking the absolute value of `b` before calculating the square root. This can lead to incorrect results in the `logHypot` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns `1`, which is not the same as the absolute value of `b`. This can lead to incorrect results or errors in the `logHypot` function.

DONE.
