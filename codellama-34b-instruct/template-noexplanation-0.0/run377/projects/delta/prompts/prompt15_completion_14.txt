  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return `undefined` if `a` is `null` or `undefined`, even if `b` is an object with non-null properties. This change is buggy because it violates the function's contract, which states that it should return an object with the differences between `a` and `b` if they are both objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return `undefined` if `a` is `null`, but not if it is `undefined`. This change is buggy because it violates the function's contract, which states that it should return an object with the differences between `a` and `b` if they are both objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && a !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `diff` function to return `undefined` if `a` is
