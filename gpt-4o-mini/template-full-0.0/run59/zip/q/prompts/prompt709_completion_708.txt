Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the arguments to the `dispatch` method, effectively ignoring any arguments that were intended to be passed, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the function being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the arguments to the `dispatch` method, which is not the same as passing the actual arguments, potentially causing the method to fail or behave incorrectly if it expects an array of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string "invalid" as the arguments to the `dispatch` method, which would not match the expected array format and could lead to errors or incorrect processing of the method being invoked.

DONE.
