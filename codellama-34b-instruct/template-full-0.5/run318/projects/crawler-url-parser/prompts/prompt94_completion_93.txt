  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the string "test" to the end of the URL, which would cause the URL to be invalid and potentially result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the number 1 to the end of the URL, which would cause the URL to be invalid and potentially result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href') + '?test'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the string "?test" to the end of the URL, which would cause the URL to be invalid and potentially result in an error.

DONE.
