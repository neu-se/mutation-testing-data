Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the pathname instead of the hostname for the 'www.' prefix, potentially leading to incorrect removal of 'www.' from the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.hostname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the hostname in a case-sensitive manner, potentially leading to incorrect results if the hostname contains uppercase letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
urlObj.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking the protocol instead of the hostname for the 'www.' prefix, which would always result in a false positive since the protocol does not contain 'www.'.

DONE.
