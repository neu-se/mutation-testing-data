 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete !== undefined && typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if `newOp.delete` is not undefined instead of checking if it is a number. This means that any falsy value other than undefined for `newOp.delete` would satisfy this condition, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' && typeof lastOp.delete === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it now checks if `newOp.delete` is a string, while previously it checked if it was a number. This would cause the condition to be false when `newOp.delete` is a number, which could lead to different execution paths and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' && lastOp.delete !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it now
