  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects a positive integer, but `-` is not a number and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects a finite number, but `NaN` is not a finite number and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects a non-null value, but `null` is a null value and would cause an error.

DONE.
