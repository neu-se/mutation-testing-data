 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the directory to the current one, instead of using the provided `src` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it enables gzip compression when compressing a tar archive, which is not the default behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./' + src
