  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the `end` value, which is a truthy value, while the replaced code fragment checks for the `null` value, which is a falsey value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the `end` value, which is a truthy value, while the replaced code fragment checks for the `undefined` value, which is a falsey value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the `end` value, which is a truthy value, while the replaced code fragment checks for the `true` value, which is a truthy value.

DONE.
