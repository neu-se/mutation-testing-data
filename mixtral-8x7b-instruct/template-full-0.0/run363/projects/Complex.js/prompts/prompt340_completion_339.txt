 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 && b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the abstract equality operator (`==`) instead of the strict equality operator (`===`). This could lead to unexpected results if the values of `a` or `b` are of a type that can be coerced to 0, such as an empty string or an object with a `valueOf()` method that returns 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the product of `a` and `b` is equal to 0, rather than checking if both `a` and `b` are individually equal to 0. This could lead to a failure to detect certain edge cases, such as when `a` is 0 and `b` is a non-zero value that is not a number (e.g. `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string).
