```
This would result in different behavior because `document` is the global object representing the current HTML document, whereas `window` is the global object representing the browser window. Using `document` instead of `window` would cause the code to retrieve the `nextTick` function from the document object, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` is a function that parses a JSON string and returns a JavaScript value. Using `JSON.parse` instead of `window` would cause the code to
