  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior becauseacc will always be set to true, meaning that the callback will never be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not a function and will result in an error if invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a function and will result in an error if invoked.

DONE.
