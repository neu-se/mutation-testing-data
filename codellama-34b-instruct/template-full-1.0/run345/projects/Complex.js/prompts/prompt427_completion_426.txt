  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the fragment `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` would be replaced with `Math.pow(5, places || 0)`, which would cause the `places` parameter to be evaluated to a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100
```
This would result in different behavior because the fragment `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` would be replaced with `Math.pow(100, places || 0)`, which would cause the `places` parameter to be evaluated to a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the fragment `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` would be replaced with `Math.pow(Math.PI, places || 0)`, which would cause the `places` parameter to be evaluated to a different value.

DONE.
