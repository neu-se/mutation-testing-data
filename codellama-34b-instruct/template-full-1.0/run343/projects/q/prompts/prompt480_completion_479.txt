  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element indicated by its index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of the array, whereas `splice()` removes a specific element indicated by its index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0,1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `splice()` removes the specified element from the array.

DONE.
