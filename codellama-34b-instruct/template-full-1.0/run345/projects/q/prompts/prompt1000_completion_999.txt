  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[PLACEHOLDER]
```
This would result in different behavior because using square brackets instead of parentheses may cause a change in the order of operations, potentially resulting in a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a logical NOT operator will negate the boolean value of `deferred.reject`, potentially causing the `deferred.reject` method to be invoked or not, depending on whether it was already truthy or falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because using `deferred.resolve` instead of `deferred.reject` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, potentially causing a different outcome in the surrounding code.

DONE.
