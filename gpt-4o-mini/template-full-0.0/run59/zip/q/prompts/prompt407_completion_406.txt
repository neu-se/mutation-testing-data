Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return true for non-promise objects, leading to the assumption that they are promises when they are not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for all objects, including non-promise objects, thus failing to accurately identify promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if the value is null, which would incorrectly classify null as a promise, while ignoring other non-promise values.

DONE.
