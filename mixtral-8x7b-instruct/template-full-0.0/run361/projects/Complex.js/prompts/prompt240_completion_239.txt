 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the denominator, which can lead to different results when calculating `im`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the denominator by `a`, which can lead to different results when calculating `im`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(r + a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the denominator, which can lead to different results when calculating `im`.

By introducing these changes, the mutated code will have different behavior compared to the original code, which can help to reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite. DONE.
