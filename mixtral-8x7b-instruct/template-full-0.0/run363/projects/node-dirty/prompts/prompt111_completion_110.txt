 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Corrupted row at the end of the db'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error message to exclude the `buffer` content, which might make it harder to diagnose the issue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Corrupted row at the end of the db')
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the error message in an Error object, but without providing any additional information, such as a stack trace, which could make debugging more difficult.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the Error object with a boolean value, causing the error handling code to fail or behave unexpectedly, thus revealing potential gaps in the error handling logic.

DONE.
