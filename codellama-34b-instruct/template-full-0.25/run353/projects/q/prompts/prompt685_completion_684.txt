  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument of the function, which is the object that the method is being called on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments of the function, which are the object that the method is being called on and the name of the method being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first three arguments of the function, which are the object that the method is being called on, the name of the method being called, and the arguments passed to the method.

DONE.
