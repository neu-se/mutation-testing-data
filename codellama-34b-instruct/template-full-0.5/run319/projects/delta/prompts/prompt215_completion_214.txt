  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of an array, while `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds or removes elements from an array, while `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two arrays.

DONE.
