  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, but `data` is a truthy value, so the code inside the if statement would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, but `data` is a truthy value, so the code inside the if statement would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that is never equal to anything, even itself. Therefore, the code inside the if statement would always execute, even if `data` is a truthy value.

DONE.
