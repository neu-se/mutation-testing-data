 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.uncork(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method no longer receives a callback function, which could cause issues if the `write` method calls the callback asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.uncork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method receives `null` as its argument, which might not behave as expected in the `writeStream` implementation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.uncork(this._queue);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method receives the `_queue` object as its argument, which might not be handled correctly in the `writeStream` implementation and could lead to unintended consequences.

DONE.
