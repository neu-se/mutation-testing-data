  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` array as a single argument, rather than passing each element of the array as a separate argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a copy of the `args` array, rather than passing the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenation of the `args` array with an empty array, rather than passing the original array.

DONE.
