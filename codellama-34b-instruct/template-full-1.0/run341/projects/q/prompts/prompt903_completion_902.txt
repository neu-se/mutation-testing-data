  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method returns a rejection reason and a rejection value, which is not desirable in this situation. By replacing it with `deferred.resolve`, the method will return a resolution value instead, which may cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is used to notify the progress of the asynchronous operation, not to reject the promise. By replacing `deferred.reject` with `deferred.notify`, the promise may be resolved before the operation is actually completed, which may cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is used to reject the promise, while `null` is a value that does not affect the promise at all. By replacing `
