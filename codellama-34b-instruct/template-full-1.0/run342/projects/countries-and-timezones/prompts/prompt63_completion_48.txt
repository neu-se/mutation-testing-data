  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, other
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` and `other` are different variables, which would cause the `getCountry` function to retrieve a different country object from the `countries` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, 'id'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `getCountry` function is expected to be the country ID, which is a string. By providing a different string, `getCountry` would retrieve a different country object from the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number between 0 and 1, which would cause `getCountry` to retrieve a different country object from the `countries` object at random.

DONE.
