  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat(["new element"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat(["new element"])` would add a new element to the end of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.filter(function(element) { return element !== "some element"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.filter(function(element) { return element !== "some element"; })` would remove any elements that match the specified condition, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
