  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise || object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isPromise` check would always return true, and the `||` operator would cause the second part of the expression to be evaluated, which would return a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise && object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isPromise` check would always return false, and the `&&` operator would cause the second part of the expression to be evaluated, which would return a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` always returns a string indicating the type of the given expression, so the `state` property would be evaluated regardless of whether `isPromise` returns true or false.

DONE.
