  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number, and `null` is an object, so the comparison will always be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison will always be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a number, and `undefined` is a primitive value, so the comparison will always be true.

DONE.
