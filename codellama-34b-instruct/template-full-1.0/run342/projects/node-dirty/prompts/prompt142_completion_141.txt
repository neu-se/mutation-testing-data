  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `err` argument was null, while the new code fragment would check if the `err` argument was equal to the number 42.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `err` argument was null, while the new code fragment would check if the `err` argument was equal to the string 'foo'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the `err` argument was null, while the new code fragment would always pass the check and go through with the next section of code.

DONE.
