  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```loop !== true```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition is negated, causing the loop to continue even if `loop` is not true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```loop && sync```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition is combined with `sync` instead of being in separate branches. If `sync` is false, the loop will continue even if `loop` is not true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```!loop && !sync```
This would result in different behavior because the loop condition is negated and combined with `sync`. If either `sync` or `loop` is not true, the loop will continue.

DONE.
