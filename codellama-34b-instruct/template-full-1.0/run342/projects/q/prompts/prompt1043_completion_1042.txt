  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"tail"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the tail property of the object instead of the head property, which could lead to unexpected results in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the length of the `ends` array instead of the head property, which could lead to unexpected results in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"NAN"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return a `Not a Number` error instead of the head property, which could lead to unexpected results in the calling code.

DONE.
