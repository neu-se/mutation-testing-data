  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes the starting index as the first argument, and the ending index as the second argument. In the original code, the starting index is `0`, which means the method starts from the beginning of the string. If the starting index is changed to `1`, the method will start from the second character of the string, which will result in a different substring being returned.
