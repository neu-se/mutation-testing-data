  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter is set to `null`, which would cause an error when trying to access the `reviver` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, { reviver: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is set to `null`, which would cause an error when trying to parse the JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, { reviver: () => {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reviver` property is set to a function that returns an empty object, which would cause the JSON string to be parsed as an empty object.

DONE.
