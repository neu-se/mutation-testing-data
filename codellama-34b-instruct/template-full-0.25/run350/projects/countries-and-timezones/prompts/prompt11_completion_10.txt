  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reset the `current` property to an empty array, regardless of whether the `tz.r` property is defined or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reset the `all` property to an empty array, regardless of whether the `tz.r` property is defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = result[country].all;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `current` property to the same value as the `all` property, regardless of whether the `tz.r` property is defined or not.

DONE.
