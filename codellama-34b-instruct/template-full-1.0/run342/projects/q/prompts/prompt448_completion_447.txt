  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the reason object would be pushed to the unhandledRejections array even if the rejection has been handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.push(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be pushed to the unhandledRejections array even if it has been handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be removed from the unhandledRejections array even if it has not been handled.

DONE.
