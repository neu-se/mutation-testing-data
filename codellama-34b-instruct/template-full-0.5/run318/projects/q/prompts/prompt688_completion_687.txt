  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` returns a new function that is bound to the current value of `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(null)` calls the `dispatch` function with a `this` value of `null`, whereas `this.dispatch` calls the function with the current value of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this, [])` calls the `dispatch` function with an empty argument list, whereas `this.dispatch` calls the function with the current value of `this`.

DONE.
