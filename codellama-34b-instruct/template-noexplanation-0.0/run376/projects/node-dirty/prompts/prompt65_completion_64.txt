  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.end()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `end()` method instead of `destroy()`. The `end()` method is used to signal the end of the stream, and it is typically used when the stream is being closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'))
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an error message to the `destroy()` method. This will cause the stream to be destroyed with an error, which may be useful for testing error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => this._writeStream.write('')
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it writes an empty string to the stream instead of the data. This may cause the stream to be closed prematurely, which could be useful for testing error handling.

DONE.
