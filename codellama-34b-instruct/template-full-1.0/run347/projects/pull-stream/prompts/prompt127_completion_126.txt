  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the current value of `i` (i.e., `i++`), while this replacement returns `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i+1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the current value of `i` (i.e., `i++`), while this replacement returns the next value of `i` (i.e., `i+1`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i*2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the current value of `i` (i.e., `i++`), while this replacement returns the current value of `i` multiplied by 2 (i.e., `i*2`).

DONE.
