  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("test")
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of resolving the promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return `undefined` instead of `resolve`, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
