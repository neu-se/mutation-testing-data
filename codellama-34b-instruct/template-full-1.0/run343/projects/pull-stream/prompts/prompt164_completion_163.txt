  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, meaning that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true` and the function would always return `abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is undefined, causing a `ReferenceError` to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `undefined`, meaning that the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false` and the function would always return `cb(null, array[i++])`.

DONE.
