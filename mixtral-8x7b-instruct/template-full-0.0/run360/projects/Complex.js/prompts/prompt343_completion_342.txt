 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2 * Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is a constant value, while the original code fragment is a function call. This change would cause the `sinh` method to return a complex number with a real part always equal to the product of the hyperbolic sine of `a` and `Math.SQRT2`, and an imaginary part always equal to the product of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and `Math.SIN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number. This change would cause the `sinh` method to return a complex number with a real part always positive or zero, and an imaginary part equal to the product of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and the sine of `b`.
