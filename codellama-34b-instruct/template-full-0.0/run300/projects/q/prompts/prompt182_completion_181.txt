  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace after the "@" symbol, which may not include the file name and line number information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(":")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the part of the stack trace before the first colon, which may not include the file name and line number information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack trace, which may not include the file name and line number information.

DONE.
