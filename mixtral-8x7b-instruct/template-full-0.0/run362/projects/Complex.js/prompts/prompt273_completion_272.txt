 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would return the angle based on the imaginary part instead of the real part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would always return 0, regardless of the input complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` method would calculate the angle based on the multiplicative inverse of the real part of the complex number, which is not equivalent to the argument of the complex number.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process aims to reveal potential weaknesses in the test suite for the given code. DONE.
