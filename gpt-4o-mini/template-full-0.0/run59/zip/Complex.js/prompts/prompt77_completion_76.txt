Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next token in the array, potentially causing the parsing logic to miss a number or an imaginary unit, leading to incorrect values for the real and imaginary parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index, causing the loop to re-evaluate the same token, which could lead to an infinite loop or incorrect parsing of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = tokens.length; // Jump to the end of the array
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the loop immediately, preventing any further processing of the tokens, which would result in the complex number being incorrectly parsed or not parsed at all.

DONE.
