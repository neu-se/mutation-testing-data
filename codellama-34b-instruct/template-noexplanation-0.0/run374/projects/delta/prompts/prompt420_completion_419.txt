  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This will cause the code to always return the maximum value between `length` and `index`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This will cause the code to always return the absolute value of the difference between `length` and `index`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This will cause the code to always return the largest integer less than or equal to the difference between `length` and `index`, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
