  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.foo` is undefined, whereas `object` is a reference to the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.bar` is undefined, whereas `object` is a reference to the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.baz` is undefined, whereas `object` is a reference to the object itself.

DONE.
