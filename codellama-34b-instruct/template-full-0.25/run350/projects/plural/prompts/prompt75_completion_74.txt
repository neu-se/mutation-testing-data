  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die" (i.e., "dice"), but the new code fragment `'dice'` would return the plural form of the word "dice" (i.e., "dice").

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which would return the plural form of the word "die" (i.e., "dice"), but the new code fragment `'die' + 's'` would return the plural form of the word "die" followed by the letter "s" (i.e., "dies").

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`,
