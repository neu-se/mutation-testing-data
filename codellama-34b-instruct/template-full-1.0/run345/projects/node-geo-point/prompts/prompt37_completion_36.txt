  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `r` would be multiplied by 2, which would result in a greater than 1 value, causing `acos` to return 0, and the distance to be calculated as 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `r` would be multiplied by -1, which would result in a value greater than 1, causing `acos` to return 0, and the distance to be calculated as 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of `r` would be incremented by π, which would result in a value greater than 1, causing `acos` to return 0, and the distance to be calculated as 0.

DONE.
