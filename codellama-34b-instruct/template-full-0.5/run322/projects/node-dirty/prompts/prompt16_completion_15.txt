  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because `.delete()` removes the key-value pair from the map, whereas `.set()` sets the value at the key. This would cause the test to fail because the key-value pair is no longer present in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, []);
```
This would result in different behavior because `.set()` sets the value at the key to an empty array, whereas the original code sets the value to the callbacks array. This would cause the test to fail because the value is no longer the same as it was before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, cbs.slice());
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the callbacks array, whereas the original code sets the value to the callbacks array itself. This would cause the test to fail
