  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream` is a function that returns a stream, whereas `nextChunk` is a function that returns a chunk of data from the current stream. By replacing `nextChunk` with `nextStream`, the code would attempt to read from the next stream in the sequence, rather than the current one, which could cause unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
