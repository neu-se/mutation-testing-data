  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: stack, configurable: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `configurable` property of the `stack` property would be set to `false`, which would prevent the property from being deleted or modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: stack, writable: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `writable` property of the `stack` property would be set to `false`, which would prevent the property from being modified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{value: stack, enumerable: false}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `enumerable` property of the `stack` property would be set to `false`, which would prevent the property from being enumerated.

DONE.
