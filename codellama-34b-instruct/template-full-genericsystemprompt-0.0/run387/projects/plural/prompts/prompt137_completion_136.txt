  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the match pattern, not the replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is the function to apply the replacement, not the replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[3]` is the function to apply the replacement, not the replacement string.

DONE.
