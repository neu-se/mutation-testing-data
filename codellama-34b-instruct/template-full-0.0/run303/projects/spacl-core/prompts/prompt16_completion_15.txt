  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment matches a string that ends with a slash only if it is not the last character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!\/)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment matches a string that ends with a slash only if it is not followed by another slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/(?!\/|$)/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches a string that ends with a slash, while the new code fragment matches a string that ends with a slash only if it is not followed by another slash or the end of the string.

DONE.
