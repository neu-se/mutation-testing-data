 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value for the arguments of `then`, and the behavior when passing `null` instead of `undefined` is not consistent across all implementations. It may cause some tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true, true, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value, but it is not equivalent to `undefined`. This change would cause the `progress` method to behave differently, which may cause some tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this, this, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `then` method refers to the promise object, not the `progressed` function. This change would cause the `progress` method to behave differently, which may cause some tests to fail.

DONE.
