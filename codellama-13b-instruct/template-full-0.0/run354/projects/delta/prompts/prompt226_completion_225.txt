  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length >= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is now compared to 0 using the greater than or equal to operator, which would include the case where `length` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is now compared to 0 using the less than operator, which would exclude the case where `length` is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` variable is now compared to 0 using the strict equality operator, which would only be true when `length` is exactly 0.

DONE.
