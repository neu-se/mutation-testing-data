  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use the latitude value instead of the longitude value, which will result in incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 180
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a longitude value that is 180 degrees greater than the original value, which will result in incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This change will cause the `calculateDestination` method to use a longitude value that is twice the original value, which will result in incorrect calculations and potentially cause the method to return incorrect values.

DONE.
