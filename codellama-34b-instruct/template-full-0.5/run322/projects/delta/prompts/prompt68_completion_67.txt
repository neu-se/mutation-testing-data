  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ retain: length }
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `delete` are different operations, and the `retain` operation would result in the text being retained, rather than deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would delete one more character than the original code, resulting in a different number of deleted characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ delete: length - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` operation would delete one fewer character than the original code, resulting in a different number of deleted characters.

DONE.
