  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips over the current operation and advances the iterator to the next one, potentially missing the opportunity to consider the current operation in the transformation calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.back()
```
This would result in different behavior because it moves the iterator back to the previous operation, potentially repeating the same operation twice and leading to duplication in the transformed Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it moves the other iterator instead of this iterator, potentially missing the opportunity to consider the current operation in the transformation calculation.

DONE.
