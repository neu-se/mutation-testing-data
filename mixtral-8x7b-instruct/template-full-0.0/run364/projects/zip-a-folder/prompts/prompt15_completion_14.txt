 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src, fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the access check would require both write and read permissions, instead of just read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.resolve(src), fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` would be resolved to an absolute path, potentially changing the behavior if the original `src` was a relative path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
src, fs.constants.X_OK
