  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `cb` to be a function, but by replacing it with `null`, it would cause an error when trying to call the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `cb` to be a function, but by replacing it with `undefined`, it would cause an error when trying to call the function. Additionally, `undefined` is a falsy value, so it would also cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, potentially causing the code to take a different path than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error('error') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `cb` to be a function, but by replacing it with a function that throws an error, it would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call the function. This could potentially cause the
