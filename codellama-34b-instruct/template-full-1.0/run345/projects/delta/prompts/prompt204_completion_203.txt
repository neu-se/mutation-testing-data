  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concat(other.ops.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the first element of the `other` delta's operations array with the `this` delta's operations array, instead of concatenating the entire `other` delta's operations array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concat(other.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other` delta's operations array starting from the second operation, instead of concatenating the entire `other` delta's operations array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concat(other.ops.filter((op) => op !== other.ops[0]))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other` delta's operations array after removing the first operation, instead of concatenating the entire `other` delta's operations array.

DONE.
