  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `inspect` property of the `promise` object, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `inspect` property of the `deferred` object, which is not defined in the provided code snippet.

DONE.
