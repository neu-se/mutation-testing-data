Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the starting index from `0` to `1` would cause the function to skip the first character of the word, leading to incorrect pluralization for words that should have their last two characters replaced.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `-1` as the starting index would cause the function to start from the end of the string, effectively removing the last character instead of the last two characters, which would yield incorrect plural forms.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the starting index to `2` would cause the function to remove the first two characters of the word instead of the last two, resulting in incorrect pluralization for words that require the last two characters to be modified.

DONE.
