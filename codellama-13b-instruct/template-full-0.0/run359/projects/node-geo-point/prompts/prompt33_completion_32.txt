  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the longitude value would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the longitude value would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value of the second point would be used instead of the longitude value of the first point, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to be off by 1 degree.

DONE.
