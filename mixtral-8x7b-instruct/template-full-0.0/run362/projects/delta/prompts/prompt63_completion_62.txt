 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 ? attributes : {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an object, even when `attributes` is null or undefined. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the logical OR operator to return an empty object when `attributes` is null or undefined. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<any>attributes) || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses type casting to treat `attributes` as an any type, and then returns an empty object when it is null or undefined. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this value, especially if there are type checks further down the line.

DONE.
