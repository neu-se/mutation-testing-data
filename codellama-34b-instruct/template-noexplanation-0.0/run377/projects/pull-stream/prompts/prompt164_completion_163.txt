  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This change will cause the function to always return `true` when `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `onAbort`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This change will cause the function to always return `false` when `abort` is truthy, regardless of the value of `onAbort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This change will cause the function to always return the opposite of `abort`, regardless of the value of `onAbort`.

DONE.
