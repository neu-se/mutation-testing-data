  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!seen[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the expression, so the `seen` object would be checked for the opposite of what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `seen` object would be updated to have a `false` value for the `key` property, which would cause the `filter` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `seen` object would be updated to have an `undefined` value for the `key` property, which would cause the `filter` function to behave differently.

DONE.
