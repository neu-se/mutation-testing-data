  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the `retain` property of `thisOp` is a string, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the `retain` property of `thisOp` is an object, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would check if the `retain` property of `thisOp` is a function, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
