  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ReturnValue` variable is defined, while this replacement checks if it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ReturnValue` variable is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `ReturnValue` variable is a function, while this replacement checks if it is not a function.

DONE.
