 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value of the returned promise would be `null` instead of the original array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value of the returned promise would be an empty array, whereas the original code resolves to an array of the input promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value of the returned promise would be a shallow copy of the input array, instead of the original array itself. This could cause issues if the original array is modified after the promise is created, as the shallow copy would not reflect those changes.

DONE.
