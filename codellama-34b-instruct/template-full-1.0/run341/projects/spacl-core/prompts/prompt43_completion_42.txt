  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would not be called with the `final` parameter set to `true`, which would cause the regex parts to be concatenated in a different order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called with the `final` parameter set to `true`, which would cause the regex parts to be concatenated in a different order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function would be called without the `final` parameter, which would cause the regex parts to be concatenated in a different order.

DONE.
