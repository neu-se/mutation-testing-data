  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part would be inverted, which would change the overall result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '' : '-') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part would be inverted, which would change the overall result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '*' : '/') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the imaginary part would be inverted, which would change the overall result of the calculation.

DONE.
