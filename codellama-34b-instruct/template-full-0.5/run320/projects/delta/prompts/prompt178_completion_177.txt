  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to iterate one less time than it should, potentially resulting in incorrect output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to iterate twice as many times as it should, potentially resulting in an infinite loop or incorrect output.

DONE.
