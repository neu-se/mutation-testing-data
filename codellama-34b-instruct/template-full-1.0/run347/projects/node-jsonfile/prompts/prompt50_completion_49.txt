  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `encoding` property from the `options` object, which may be different from the original behavior which used the `options` object directly as the third argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the encoding `'utf8'`, regardless of the `options` object passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, Object.keys(options)[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the first key from the `options` object as the encoding, which may not be the same as the original behavior which used the `options` object directly as the third argument.

DONE.
