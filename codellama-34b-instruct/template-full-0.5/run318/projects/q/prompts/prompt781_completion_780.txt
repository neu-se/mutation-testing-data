  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    throw new Error("test error");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `regardless` is a function that returns a value, while the new code fragment throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return "test value";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `regardless` is a function that returns a value, while the new code fragment returns a different value, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {
    return Q.reject("test rejection");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `regardless` is a function that returns a promise, while the new code fragment returns a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
