  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace(/^\//,'')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the leading '/' character from the src string, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently if the src string is expected to contain a leading '/' character.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace("a/b","c/d")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the substring "a/b" in the src string with the substring "c/d", which would potentially alter the program's behavior if the program relies on finding or manipulating the src string in some way.  

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src+='extra code'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'extra code' to the end of the src string, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently if the program relies on the length or contents of the src string in some way.
