  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input values, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` returns a random number between 0 and 1, which would cause the `Complex` constructor to return a different value each time it is called.

DONE.
