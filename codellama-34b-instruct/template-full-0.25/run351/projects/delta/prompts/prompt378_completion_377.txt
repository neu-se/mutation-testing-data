  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `otherIter.next()` instead of `otherIter.next(length)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `otherIter.next()` instead of `otherIter.next(length)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `otherIter.next()` instead of `otherIter.next(length)`.

DONE.
