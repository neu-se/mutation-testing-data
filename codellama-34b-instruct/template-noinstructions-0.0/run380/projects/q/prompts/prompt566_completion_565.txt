  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value after a delay, whereas `when` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a promise that is rejected with the given value, whereas `when` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, whereas `when` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value immediately.

DONE.
