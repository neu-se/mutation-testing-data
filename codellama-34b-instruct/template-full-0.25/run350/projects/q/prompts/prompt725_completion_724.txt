  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.value` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
