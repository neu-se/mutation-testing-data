  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `flushing`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`. This would cause the `nextTick` function to always run the `flush` function, even if `flushing` is already `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextTick` function to never run the `flush` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing && !flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, causing the `nextTick` function to never run the `flush` function.

DONE.
