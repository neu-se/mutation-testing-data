  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is a function that returns the opposite of `ses.ok`, so if `ses.ok` returns `true`, `ses.notOk` would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.maybeOk` is a function that returns `true` if `ses.ok` returns `true`, but it also returns `true` if `ses.ok` returns `false` and the current date is a Saturday or Sunday.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk && ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `false` if `ses.notOk` returns `false` or if `ses.maybeOk` returns `false`.

DONE.
