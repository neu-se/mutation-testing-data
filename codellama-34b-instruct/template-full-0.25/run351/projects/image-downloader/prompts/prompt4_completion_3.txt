  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is strictly equal to `undefined`. If `options.dest` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or an empty string), the original code would still evaluate to `true`, while this new code would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest || options.dest.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.dest` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `options.dest` is either falsy or an empty string. If `options.dest` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or an empty array), the original code would still evaluate to `true`, while this new code would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
