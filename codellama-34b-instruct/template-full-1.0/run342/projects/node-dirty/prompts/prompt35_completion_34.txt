  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined`. The original code expects a value to be deleted, while the new code will update the value to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`key, '', cb`
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is not the same as `undefined`. The original code expects a value to be deleted, while the new code will update the value to an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, {}, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is not the same as `undefined`. The original code expects a value to be deleted, while the new code will update the value to an empty object.

DONE.
