Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is not `undefined`, which would allow for cases where `thisOp.retain` is explicitly set to `null` to be treated differently than the original code, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is strictly equal to `false`, which would ignore cases where `thisOp.retain` is `null` or any other falsy value, thus altering the logic for how operations are composed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain == true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is loosely equal to `true`, which would incorrectly allow for any truthy value to pass through, potentially leading to unintended compositions of operations that should not occur.

DONE.
