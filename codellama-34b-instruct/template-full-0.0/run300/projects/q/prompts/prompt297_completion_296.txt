  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to always return `x`, regardless of whether `x` and `y` are the same or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to return `y + 1` if `x` and `y` are the same, and a rejection otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `join` method to return `x + y` if `x` and `y` are the same, and a rejection otherwise.

DONE.
