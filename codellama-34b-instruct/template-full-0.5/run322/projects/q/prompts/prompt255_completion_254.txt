  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` variable is not defined in the current scope, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the second argument to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
