  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.bind(this)` is a bound function, which would return a different object when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function that takes no arguments, and `this.inspect(1)` would pass an argument to the function, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.inspect` is a function, and `this.inspect.call(this)` would call the function with a different `this` value, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
