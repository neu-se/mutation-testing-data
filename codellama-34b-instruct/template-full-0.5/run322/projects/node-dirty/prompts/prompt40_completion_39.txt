  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key !== val
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `val` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks whether `key` is not equal to `val`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key !== 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `val` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks whether `key` is not equal to the string `'key'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== 'val'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `val` is undefined, while this new code fragment checks whether `val` is not equal to the string `'val'`.

DONE.
