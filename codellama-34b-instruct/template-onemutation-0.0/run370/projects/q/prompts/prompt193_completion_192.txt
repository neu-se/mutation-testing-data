  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt3[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attempt3` is an array, and `attempt3[1]` would return the second element of the array, which is not a function. In the original code, `attempt3` is a function that is called with `stackLine` as an argument.
