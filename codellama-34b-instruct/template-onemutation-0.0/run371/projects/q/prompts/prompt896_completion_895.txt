  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while the modified code fragment passes `null` as the context to the `defer` function, which would cause the promise to be resolved immediately with a value of `null`.
