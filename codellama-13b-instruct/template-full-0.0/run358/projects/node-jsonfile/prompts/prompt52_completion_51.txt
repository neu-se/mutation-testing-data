  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `obj` object, which could potentially return a different string than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toJSON()` method is called on the `obj` object, which could potentially return a different JSON string than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify()` method is called with different parameters than the original code, which could potentially return a different JSON string than the original code.

DONE.
