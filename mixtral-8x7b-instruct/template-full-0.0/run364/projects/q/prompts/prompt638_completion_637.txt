 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method is expecting the `key` to be passed as an argument, not the `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method is expecting a value to be passed as an argument, and `null` is a valid value. However, this would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently because it is expecting an array with the method name and arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method is expecting a value to be passed as an argument, and `Promise.resolve()` returns a promise object. This would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently because it is expecting an array with the method name and arguments.

DONE.
