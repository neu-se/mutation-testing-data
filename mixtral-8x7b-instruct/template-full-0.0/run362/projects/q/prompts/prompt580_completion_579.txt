 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return continuer; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would not be called directly, but rather a new function that returns `continuer` would be called, causing the `continuer` function to be called in the next turn instead of immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.continuer
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` now refers to the global object, so `this.continuer` would be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `continuer` function would always be called with the "throw" verb, causing any arguments passed to `continuer` to be treated as exceptions.

DONE.
