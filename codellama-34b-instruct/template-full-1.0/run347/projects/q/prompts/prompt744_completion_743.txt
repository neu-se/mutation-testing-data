  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onRejected` function is called instead of `onFulfilled` when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because the `any` function is called instead of `onFulfilled` when the promise is resolved, and it returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise, or a rejected promise if all promises are rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `allSettled` function is called instead of `onFulfilled` when the promise is resolved, and it returns a promise that is fulfilled with the value of the first resolved promise, or a rejected promise if all promises are rejected.

DONE.
