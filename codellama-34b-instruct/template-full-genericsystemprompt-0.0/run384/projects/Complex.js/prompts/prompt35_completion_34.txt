  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a` is `0`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `b` is `1`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `a` and `b` are both `0`, regardless of their individual values.

DONE.
