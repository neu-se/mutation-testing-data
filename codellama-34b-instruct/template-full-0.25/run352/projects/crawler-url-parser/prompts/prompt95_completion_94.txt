  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the base URL string to lowercase, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and normalization logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the base URL string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as the delimiter, and then return the first element of the array. This could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and normalization logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http://` or `https://` protocol from the base URL string, which could potentially cause issues with the URL parsing and normalization logic.

DONE.
