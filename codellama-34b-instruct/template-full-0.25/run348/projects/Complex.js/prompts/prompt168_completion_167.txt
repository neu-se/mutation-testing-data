  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if `z` is not a `Complex` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if `z` is not a `Complex` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if `z` is not a `Complex` object.

DONE.
