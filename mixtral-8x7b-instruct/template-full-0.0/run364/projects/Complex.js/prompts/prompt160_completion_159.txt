 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks for a specific infinite real part, rather than checking if the number is infinite in any direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number is zero, rather than checking if it is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.isInfinite.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `isInfinite` method from the Object prototype, which would always return `false` for complex numbers.

DONE.
