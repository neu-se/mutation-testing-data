  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the next `length + 1` elements instead of only the next `length` elements, which would affect the end result of the transformation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the next `length - 1` elements instead of only the next `length` elements, which would affect the end result of the transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always skip the next `length * 2` elements instead of only the next `length` elements, which would affect the end result of the transformation.

DONE.
