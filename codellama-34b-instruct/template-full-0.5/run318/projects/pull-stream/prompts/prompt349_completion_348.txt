  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the input data, while `data + 1` would be a reference to the input data plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the input data, while `data - 1` would be a reference to the input data minus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a reference to the input data, while `data * 2` would be a reference to the input data multiplied by 2.

DONE.
