  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment uses `closed.resolve(error)`, which would resolve the promise with the given error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the new code fragment uses `closed.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))`, which would reject the promise with a new error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(Q.reject(error));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `closed.reject(error)`, which would reject the promise with the given error
