  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_b` has a different value than `_a`, which would affect the calculation of the logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a + _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a + _b` has a different value than `_a`, which would affect the calculation of the logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a - _b
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a - _b` has a different value than `_a`, which would affect the calculation of the logarithm.

DONE.
