  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` would convert the string to a number, while the new code fragment `"0"` would simply return the string "0".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` would convert the string to a number, while the new code fragment `null` would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Number` would convert the string to a number, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return undefined.

DONE.
