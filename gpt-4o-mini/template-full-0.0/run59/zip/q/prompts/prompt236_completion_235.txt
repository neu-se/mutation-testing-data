Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to `promiseDispatch`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the operation and operands.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `resolvedPromise` with `null`, which would cause the promise dispatch to fail since it would not have a valid promise to operate on.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the second argument instead of `args`, which would disrupt the expected operation and operands for the promise dispatch, potentially leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
