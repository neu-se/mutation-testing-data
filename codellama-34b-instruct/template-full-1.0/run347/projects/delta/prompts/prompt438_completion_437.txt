  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the `retain` property as a string, even if it is a number, which could lead to unexpected results in the `retain` property's logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the `retain` property as undefined, even if it is defined, which could lead to unexpected results in the `retain` property's logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the `retain` property as an object, even if it is a number or a string, which could lead to unexpected results in the `retain` property's logic.

DONE.
