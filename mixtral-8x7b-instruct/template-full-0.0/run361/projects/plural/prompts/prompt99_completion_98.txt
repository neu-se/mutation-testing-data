 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/[a-z]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any lowercase letter, not just 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^a$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches the string 'a', not words ending in 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character at the end of a string, not just 'a'.

DONE.
