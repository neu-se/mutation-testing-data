  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the key value by 1, which would result in a different object property being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the key value, which would result in a different object property being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key value to a string, which would result in a different object property being accessed.

DONE.
