  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus` and `minus` variables would be treated as booleans, and the expression would evaluate to `true` if either variable is `true`, regardless of their values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus` and `minus` variables would be treated as integers, and the expression would evaluate to `true` if the sum of the variables is equal to 2, regardless of their values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus` and `minus` variables would be treated as strings, and the expression would evaluate to `true` if the concatenation of the variables is equal to the string "foo", regardless of their values.

DONE.
