  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the tab character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the space character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the newline character, while the new code fragment splits the buffer into rows based on the literal string '\n'.

DONE.
