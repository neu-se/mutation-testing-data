  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] * z['re'], this['im'] * z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to add the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, while this replacement uses the `*` operator to multiply them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] / z['re'], this['im'] / z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to add the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, while this replacement uses the `/` operator to divide them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(this['re'] - z['re'], this['im'] - z['im']);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to add the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers, while this
