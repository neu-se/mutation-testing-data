Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving to the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `next(1)` advances the iterator by one operation but does not return the operation itself, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation's attributes and length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because advancing the iterator by two operations instead of one could skip over an operation entirely, leading to incorrect transformations and potentially losing important data in the delta.

DONE.
