  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined" && typeof self === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `window` or `self` is defined, while this code checks if both are undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object" || typeof self !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `window` or `self` is an object, while this code checks if both are not objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "function" || typeof self !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `window` or `self` is a function, while this code checks if both are not functions.

DONE.
