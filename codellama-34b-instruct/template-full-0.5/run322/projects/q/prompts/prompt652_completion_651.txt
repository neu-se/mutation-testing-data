  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument of the `post` method, which is the name of the method to invoke.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two arguments of the `post` method, which are the object and the name of the method to invoke.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first three arguments of the `post` method, which are the object, the name of the method to invoke, and the arguments to pass to the method.

DONE.
