  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `oses` function would return a different value due to the negation of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `oses` function would return a different value due to the changing of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `oses` function would return a different value due to the `null` input.

DONE.
