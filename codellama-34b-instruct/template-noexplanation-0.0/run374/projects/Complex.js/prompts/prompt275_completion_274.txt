  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This will cause the `sin` function to be replaced with the `cos` function, which will produce different results and potentially reveal errors in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This will cause the `sin` function to be replaced with the `tan` function, which will also produce different results and potentially reveal errors in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This will cause the `sin` function to be replaced with the `asin` function, which will also produce different results and potentially reveal errors in the test suite.

DONE.
