  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function and return its result, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `inspect` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the `this` context of the current object, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `inspect` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` function with the `this` context of the current object and the `arguments` object as its arguments, whereas the original code fragment simply returns the `inspect` function itself.

DONE.
