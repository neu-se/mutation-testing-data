  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This change will cause the `reject` method to be called instead of `resolve`, which will result in the promise being rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This change will cause the `reject` method to be called instead of `notify`, which will result in the promise being rejected instead of notified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This change will cause the `reject` method to be called with a new error object, which will result in the promise being rejected with the specified error.

DONE.
