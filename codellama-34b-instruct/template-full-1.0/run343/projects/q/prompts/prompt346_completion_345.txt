  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(inspected)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is called with the object returned by `inspect`, which contains information about the promise's state and value, whereas `reject` is typically called with a string indicating the reason for the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(inspect())
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is called with the return value of `inspect`, which is an object containing information about the promise's state and value, whereas `resolve` is typically called with the promise's fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw inspected
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is called with the object returned by `inspect`, which causes an exception to be thrown, whereas `reject` is typically called to indicate a rejection.

DONE.
