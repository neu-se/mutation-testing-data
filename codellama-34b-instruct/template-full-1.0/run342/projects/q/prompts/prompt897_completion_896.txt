  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because `return this` would return the current promise object, whereas the original code fragment would return the result of `deferred.promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `return deferred.reject(error)` would reject the promise with the given error, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the given error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return deferred.promise.throw(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because `return deferred.promise.throw(error)` would throw an error, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the given error.

DONE.
