  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to invert the `insert` property of the `baseOp` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to invert the `retain` property of the `baseOp` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to invert the `delete` property of the `baseOp` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
