  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x0000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null character (U+0000) instead of a placeholder character (U+FFFC).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x0001)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a start of heading (SOH) character (U+0001) instead of a placeholder character (U+FFFC).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0x0002)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a start of text (STX) character (U+0002) instead of a placeholder character (U+FFFC).

DONE.
