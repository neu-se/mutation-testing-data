  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype()` function uses strict equality (`===`), while comparing with `NaN` would return `false`.
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const value = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype()` function uses strict equality (`===`), while comparing with an empty string (`''`) would return `false`.
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let object = {valueOf: function() {return 'a'}};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gettype()` function uses the `valueOf()` method of the object, which would return a different value than the original `currentUrl` object.
DONE.
