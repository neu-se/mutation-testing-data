  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in a different implementation of the `cos` function, as it would calculate the cosine of `b` instead of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + b)
```
This would result in a different implementation of the `cos` function, as it would calculate the sine of `a + b` instead of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + b) + 1
```
This would result in a different implementation of the `cos` function, as it would calculate the cosine of `a + b` and add 1 to it, instead of just calculating the cosine of `a`.

DONE.
