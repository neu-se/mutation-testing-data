  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [null, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method with `null` as the context object, instead of `void 0` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "call" method with the arguments passed directly, instead of passing an array of arguments as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [undefined, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "apply" method with `undefined` as the context object, instead of `void 0` as in the original code.

DONE.
