  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `has()` returns a boolean indicating whether the map has the specified key, whereas `get()` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + '_mod'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the key passed to the `get()` method, potentially causing the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key => this._data.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value returned by `get()`, potentially causing the method to return a different value.

DONE.
