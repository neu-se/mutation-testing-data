  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the first argument to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the first argument to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"foo"` would be passed as the first argument to `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
