  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key of object
```
This would result in different behavior because `of` is used to iterate over the values of an object, whereas `in` is used to check for the existence of a property in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = object.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` is a method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, whereas `in` is used to check for the existence of a property in an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Object.keys(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` is a method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names, whereas `in` is used to check for the existence of a property in an object.

DONE.
