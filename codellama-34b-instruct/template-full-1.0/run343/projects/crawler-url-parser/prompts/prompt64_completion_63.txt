  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host, {hierarchy: true});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hierarchy` option would provide a different set of results than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host, {augmentDot: true});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `augmentDot` option would provide a different set of results than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse(ret.host, {ignore: 'all'});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ignore` option would provide a different set of results than the original code.

DONE.
