  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(array)` would always return `true` if `array` is an array, regardless of its length. In contrast, `!Array.isArray(array)` would return `true` if `array` is not an array, and `false` if it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length === 0` would check if the length of the array is equal to 0, while `!Array.isArray(array)` would check if the variable `array` is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof array !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof array !== 'object'` would check if the variable `array` is not an object, while `!Array.isArray(array)` would check if the
