 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delta` to push `otherOp` when the current operation is a non-deletion, instead of only pushing when the current operation is a deletion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delta` to push `otherOp` when the current operation is an insertion, instead of only pushing when the current operation is a deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek().delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delta` to push `otherOp` when the next operation in the current delta is a deletion, instead of only pushing when the current operation in the `otherIter` is a deletion.

DONE.
