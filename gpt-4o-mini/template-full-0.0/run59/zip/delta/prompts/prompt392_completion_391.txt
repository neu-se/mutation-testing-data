Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter.next()` method to consume one extra operation than intended, potentially skipping an operation and altering the resulting `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter.next()` method to consume one less operation than intended, which could lead to incorrect transformations and loss of data in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the next operation plus one, which could lead to an attempt to consume more operations than available, potentially resulting in an error or unexpected behavior in the transformation process.

DONE.
