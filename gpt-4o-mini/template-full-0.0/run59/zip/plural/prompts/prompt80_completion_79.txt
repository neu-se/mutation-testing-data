Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because "gooses" is not the correct plural form of "goose," which should be "geese."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because returning "goose" would imply that the plural form is the same as the singular, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geesees'
```
This would result in different behavior because "geesees" is a nonsensical plural form that does not exist in English, thus failing to provide the correct pluralization.

DONE.
