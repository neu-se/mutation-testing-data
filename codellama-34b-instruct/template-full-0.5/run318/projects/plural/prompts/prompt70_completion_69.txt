  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a call to the `addRule` function with two arguments, but the new code fragment is a call to the `addRule` function with a single argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a call to the `addRule` function with two arguments, but the new code fragment is a call to the `addRule` function with only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello'.repeat(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a call to the `addRule` function with two arguments, but the new code fragment is a call to the `addRule` function with two arguments, but the second argument is a repeated string.

DONE.
