  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would not be called if it is not a function, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback && typeof callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would be called even if it is not a function, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would not be called if it is not a function, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

DONE.
