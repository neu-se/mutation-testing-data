  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the code to block until the file is read, rather than returning a promise that resolves when the file is read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null, file)` is a bound version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the code to read the file at the specified path, but it would not return a promise that resolves when the file is read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile.bind(null, file, options)` is a bound version of `fs.readFile`, and it would cause the code
