  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical AND operator (`&&`) always returns the second operand if the first operand is truthy, and `0` is falsy, so the expression would always evaluate to `0`. In contrast, the original code uses the OR operator (`||`), which returns the first operand if it is truthy, and the second operand otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : places
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator (`?:`) is used to conditionally return `0` if `places` is truthy, or `places` if it is falsy. In contrast, the original code uses the OR operator (`||`) to return `0` if `places` is falsy, or `places` otherwise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(places, 0)
```
