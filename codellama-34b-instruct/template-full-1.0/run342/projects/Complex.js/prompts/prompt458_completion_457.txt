  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isFinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (this['isFinite']())` would check if the number is finite, whereas `if (this['isInfinite']())` would check if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!this['isNaN']())
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (!this['isNaN']())` would check if the number is not NaN, whereas `if (this['isInfinite']())` would check if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isFinite']() && !this['isNaN']())
```
This would result in different behavior because `if (this['isFinite']() && !this['isNaN']())` would check if the number is both finite and not NaN, whereas `if (this['isInfinite']())` would check only if the number
