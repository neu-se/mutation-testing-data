  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM *= 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `im` property is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = !noIM;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable would be negated, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if the `im` property is not equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noIM = noIM * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noIM` variable would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if the `im` property is not equal to 0.

DONE.
