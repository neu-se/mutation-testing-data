  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the post-decrement operator would decrement the value of `i` before it is used in the loop, whereas the original code fragment would increment the value of `i` after it is used in the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `i` would be incremented by 2 after each iteration of the loop, whereas the original code fragment would increment the value of `i` by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `i` would be multiplied by 2 after each iteration of the loop, whereas the original code fragment would increment the value of `i` by 1.

DONE.
