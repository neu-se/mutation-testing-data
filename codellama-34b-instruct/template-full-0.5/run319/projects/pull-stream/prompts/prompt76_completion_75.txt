  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is now always `false`, which means that the `read` function will never be called with `abort` set to `true`. This could cause the `drain` function to behave differently than expected, especially if the `read` function is designed to handle the `abort` parameter in a specific way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` variable is now always `true`, which means that the `read` function will never be called with `done` set to `false`. This could cause the `drain` function to behave differently than expected, especially if the `read` function is designed to handle the `done` parameter in a specific way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true, done || function (err) {
