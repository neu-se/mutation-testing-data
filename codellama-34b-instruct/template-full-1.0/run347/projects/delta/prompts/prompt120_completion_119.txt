  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (elem.delete < 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `typeof` to check if `elem.delete` is a number. Changing the condition to `elem.delete < 1` will result in a different branch of the `if` statement being executed, which may cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (elem.delete <= 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `typeof` to check if `elem.delete` is a number. Changing the condition to `elem.delete <= 0` will result in a different branch of the `if` statement being executed, which may cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof lastOp.delete === 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `typeof` to check if `elem.delete` is
