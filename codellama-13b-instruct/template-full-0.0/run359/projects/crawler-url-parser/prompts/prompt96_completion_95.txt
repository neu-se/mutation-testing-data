```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of `href` and `baseUrlStr` would create a new string that is not the same as the original `href` variable. This could cause issues in the `gettype` function, which relies on the `href` variable being a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `href` variable to lowercase, which could cause issues in the `gettype` function, which relies on the `href` variable being a valid URL.

```
href.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove the `http` or `https` protocol from the `href` variable, which could cause issues in the `gettype` function, which re
