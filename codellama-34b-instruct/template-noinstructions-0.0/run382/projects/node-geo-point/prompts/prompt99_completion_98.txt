  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which could cause issues when using the resulting GeoPoint object in calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which could cause issues when using the resulting GeoPoint object in calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the coordinates is reversed, which could cause issues when using the resulting GeoPoint object in calculations.

DONE.
