  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of `read` by 1, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the value of `read` by 1, which would also change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `read`, which would also change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
