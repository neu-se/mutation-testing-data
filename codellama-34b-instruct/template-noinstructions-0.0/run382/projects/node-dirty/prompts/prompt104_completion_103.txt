  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the key from the data, whereas `set` would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` would remove all key-value pairs from the data, whereas `set` would update the value associated with a specific key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set` with `undefined` as the value would remove the key from the data, whereas `delete` would remove the key from the data.

DONE.
