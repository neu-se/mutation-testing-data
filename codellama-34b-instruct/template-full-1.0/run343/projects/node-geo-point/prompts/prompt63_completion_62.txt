  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` and `φ2` are different values, and using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation to return an incorrect bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI / 2 - φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI / 2 - φ2` is the same as `φ1`, but using this expression instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation to return an incorrect bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ2 * 2` is twice the value of `φ2`, and using this expression instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation to return an incorrect bearing.

DONE.
