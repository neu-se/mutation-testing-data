 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b > 0 && a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to check if `b` is greater than 0 instead of checking if `b` is equal to 0. This would cause the function to return a different result when the input has a non-zero imaginary part and a positive real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(b) < Number.EPSILON && a > 0
