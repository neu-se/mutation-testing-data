  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first element of the `promises` array is equal to 0, rather than checking if the length of the array is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `promises` array is less than 0, which is always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the `promises` array is equal to its own length, which is always true.

DONE.
