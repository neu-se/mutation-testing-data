  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the negated value would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`, and vice versa, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
