 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isFinite(this['re']*10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part multiplied by 10 is finite, instead of checking if both the real and imaginary parts are finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns false, assuming the imaginary part is not exactly equal to 1, regardless of the real part's value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the sum of the real and imaginary parts, instead of checking if the complex number is not at the infinity pole of the Riemann sphere.

DONE.
