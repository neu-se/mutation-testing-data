  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property of the `newOp` object is not a string, but a number. This would cause the `insert` method to fail and return `this` instead of the modified `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` property of the `newOp` object is not a number, but a string. This would cause the `delete` method to fail and return `this` instead of the modified `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property of the `newOp` object is not a number, but a string. This would cause the `retain` method to fail and return `this` instead of the modified `Delta` object.

DONE.
