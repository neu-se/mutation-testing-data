 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(function() { self.reject(error); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be rejected asynchronously, instead of synchronously as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
self.resolve(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw error;
```
This would result in different behavior because an exception would be thrown, causing the current execution context to terminate, instead of rejecting the promise.

DONE.
