  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an exception if the `rejected` callback is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a rejection if the `rejected` callback is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns a rejection if the `rejected` callback is not a function, and the rejection reason is the original exception, not a new error object.

DONE.
