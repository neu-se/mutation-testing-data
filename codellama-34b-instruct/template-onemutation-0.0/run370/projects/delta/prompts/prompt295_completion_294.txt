  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.next` is a function that returns the next value in the iteration, while `iter.next()` is a function call that returns the result of the function. In this case, the function call would return `undefined` instead of the expected value.
