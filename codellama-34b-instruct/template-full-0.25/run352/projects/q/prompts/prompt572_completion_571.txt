  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `this`, and it would likely cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `this`, and it would likely cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string, and it would likely cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly, as it is not a valid value for the `this` keyword.

DONE.
