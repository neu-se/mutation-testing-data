  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `err` is truthy, `abortCb` would be called with `aborted`, instead of `err` as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!err) abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `err` is falsy, `abortCb` would be called with `aborted`, instead of `err` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err) cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `err` is truthy, `cb` would be called with `err`, instead of `aborted` as in the original code.

DONE.
