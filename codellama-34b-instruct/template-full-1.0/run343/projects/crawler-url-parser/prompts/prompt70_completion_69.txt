  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.load(data, { xmlMode: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `xmlMode` option is set to `true`, which would parse the data as XML instead of HTML. This would affect the selector engine, attribute handling, and other parsing behavior, leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.load(data, { decodeEntities: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `decodeEntities` option is set to `false`, which would not decode HTML entities in the data. This would cause the selector engine to not recognize certain entities, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$.load(data, { withCredentials: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `withCredentials` option is set to `true`, which would send cookies and authorization headers with the request. This would allow the loaded data to access external resources based on the user's authentication status, potentially leading
