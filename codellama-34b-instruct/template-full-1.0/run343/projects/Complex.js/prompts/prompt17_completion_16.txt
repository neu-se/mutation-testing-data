  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `x` and `y` instead of using the absolute value of `x` as the first argument to `Math.abs`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x ** y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would raise `x` to the power of `y` instead of using the absolute value of `x` as the first argument to `Math.abs`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / y
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide `x` by `y` instead of using the absolute value of `x` as the first argument to `Math.abs`.

DONE.
