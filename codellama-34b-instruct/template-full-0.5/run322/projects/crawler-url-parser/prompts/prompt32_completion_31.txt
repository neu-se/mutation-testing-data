  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http://` protocol would be replaced with `https://`, which could cause issues if the website does not support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http://` protocol would be replaced with `ftp://`, which is a different protocol and could cause issues if the website does not support FTP.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'//'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `http://` protocol would be replaced with `//`, which is a valid protocol-relative URL, but could cause issues if the website does not support protocol-relative URLs.

DONE.
