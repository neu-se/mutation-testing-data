  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row: ${this.kv.get(rowStr)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to get the value of the corrupted row from the cache, which would not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row: ${rowStr.val}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to get the value of the corrupted row from the row object, which would not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row: ${this.emit.get(rowStr)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to get the value of the corrupted row from the `emit` function, which would not exist.

DONE.
