  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `object` function instead of accessing its `inspect` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method of the `object` function instead of accessing its `inspect` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect = function () { return "buggy"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `inspect` property of the `object` function to always return the string "buggy".

DONE.
