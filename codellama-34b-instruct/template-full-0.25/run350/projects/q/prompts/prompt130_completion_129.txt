  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property at the given index, rather than the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the property, rather than the key itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index].key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the property at the given index, rather than the key itself.

DONE.
