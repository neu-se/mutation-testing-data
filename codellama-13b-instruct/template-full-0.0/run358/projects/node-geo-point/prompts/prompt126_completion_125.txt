  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the sum of the latitude and longitude values, which is not the correct way to calculate the distance between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude - this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the difference between the latitude and longitude values, which is not the correct way to calculate the distance between two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(this.longitude, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points, which is the correct way to calculate the distance between two points.

DONE.
