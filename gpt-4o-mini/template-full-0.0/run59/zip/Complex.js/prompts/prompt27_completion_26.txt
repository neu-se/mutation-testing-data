Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Argument'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message returned would change from 'Invalid Param' to 'Invalid Argument', potentially affecting how the error is handled or displayed in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Error: Invalid Parameter'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would now include the prefix 'Error: ', which may change how the error is logged or displayed, and could affect any error handling logic that relies on specific message formats.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Input'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would change to 'Invalid Input', which may not be recognized by existing error handling mechanisms that expect the original message 'Invalid Param', leading to different responses in the application.

DONE.
