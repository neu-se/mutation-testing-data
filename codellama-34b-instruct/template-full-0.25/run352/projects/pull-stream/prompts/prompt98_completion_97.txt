  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the callback with `null` as the second argument when `err` was `true`, but this new code fragment would call the callback with `null` as the second argument regardless of the value of `err`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called the callback with `null` as the first argument when `err` was `true`, but this new code fragment would call the callback with `err` as the first argument regardless of the value of `err`.
