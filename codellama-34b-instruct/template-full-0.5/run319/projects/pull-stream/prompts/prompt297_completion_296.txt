  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` function as an argument, while this replacement code fragment calls the `cb` function directly with `null` and `data` as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` function as an argument, while this replacement code fragment calls the `cb` function directly with `ended` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `terminate(cb)` calls the `terminate` function with the `cb` function as an argument, while this replacement code fragment calls the `cb` function directly with `null` and `data` as
