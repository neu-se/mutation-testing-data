  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` creates a new object with the specified prototype, while `null` is a primitive value that does not have a prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` creates a new object with the specified prototype, while `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have a prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create` creates a new object with the specified prototype, while `{}` is an empty object literal that does not have a prototype.

DONE.
