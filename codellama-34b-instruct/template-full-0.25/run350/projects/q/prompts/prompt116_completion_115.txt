  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the index variable to access the array element, but by adding 1 to the index, the code would be accessing the next element in the array, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the index variable to access the array element, but by subtracting 1 from the index, the code would be accessing the previous element in the array, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the index variable to access the array element, but by multiplying the index by 2, the code would be accessing the element at twice the index, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
