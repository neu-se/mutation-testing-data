  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the 'quy' rule, which was previously handled by a separate rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
