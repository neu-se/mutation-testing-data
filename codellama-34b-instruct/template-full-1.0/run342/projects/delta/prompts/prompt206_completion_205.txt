  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is not a method of the `Delta` class, and it would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push();
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` without any arguments would push `undefined` onto the `ops` array, which is not a valid operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` expects a number as its first argument, and passing in an `otherOp` object would cause a type error.

DONE.
