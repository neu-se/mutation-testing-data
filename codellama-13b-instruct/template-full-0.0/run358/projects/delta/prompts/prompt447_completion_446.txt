  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the `ops` array instead of the current element. This could cause the `next()` method to return a different value than expected, potentially leading to bugs in the code that relies on the `Iterator` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the `ops` array instead of the current element. This could cause the `next()` method to return a different value than expected, potentially leading to bugs in the code that relies on the `Iterator` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the current element in the `ops` array instead of accessing it directly. This could cause the `
