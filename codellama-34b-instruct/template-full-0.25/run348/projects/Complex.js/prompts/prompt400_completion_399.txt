  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + Math.sqrt(1 + c * c)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sqrt(c * c + 1)`, which is a more accurate calculation of the square root of `c * c + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sqrt(c * c + 1)`, which is a more accurate calculation of the square root of `c * c + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * c - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `Math.sqrt(c * c + 1)`, which is a more accurate calculation of the square root of `c * c + 1`.

DONE.
