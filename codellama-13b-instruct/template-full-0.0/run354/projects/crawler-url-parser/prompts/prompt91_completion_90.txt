  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive. This would cause the regular expression to match URLs with different cases, such as `JavaScript` or `MAILTO:`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/g.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it global. This would cause the regular expression to match all occurrences of the URL in the input string, rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/m.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it multiline. This would cause the regular expression to match URLs that span
