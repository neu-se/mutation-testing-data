  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator, which returns `true` if its operand is falsy and `false` otherwise. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT operator, which returns `true` if its operand is truthy and `false` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND operator, which returns the first falsy operand or the last operand if all operands are truthy. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT operator, which returns `true` if its operand is truthy and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
