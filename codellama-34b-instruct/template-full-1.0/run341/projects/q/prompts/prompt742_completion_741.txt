  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` would be called with an invalid argument, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.when
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not a promise, and does not have a `when` method, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise` is not a promise, and `Q.when` would be called with an invalid argument, causing an error.

DONE.
