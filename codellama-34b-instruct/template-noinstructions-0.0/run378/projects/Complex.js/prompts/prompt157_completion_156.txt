  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero, while the new code fragment only checks if `this` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) || z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero, while the new code fragment checks if either `this` or `z` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are zero, while the new code fragment checks if `this` is
