  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[verb].apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb` is not a method of `result`, so calling `result[verb].apply` would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
generator[verb].apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb` is not a method of `generator`, so calling `generator[verb].apply` would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
makeGenerator[verb].apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `verb` is not a method of `makeGenerator`, so calling `makeGenerator[verb].apply` would throw an error.

DONE.
