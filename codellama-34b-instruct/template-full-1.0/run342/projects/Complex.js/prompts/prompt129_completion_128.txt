  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return NaN, regardless of the values of the two complex numbers being added.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return Infinity, regardless of the values of the two complex numbers being added.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (parseFloat(a) < parseFloat(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different result than the original code, depending on the values of the two complex numbers being added.

DONE.
