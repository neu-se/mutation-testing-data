  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` to refer to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` refers to the real part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the `cosh` function to operate on the wrong value, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` to refer to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b * 2` would refer to twice the imaginary part. Using `b * 2` instead of `b` would cause the `cosh` function to operate on a different value, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `b` to refer to the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a + b`
