 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'INFINITY' when 'z' is infinite, while the original code fragment returns 'NAN' when both 'this' and 'z' are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'NAN' when 'z' is zero, while the original code fragment returns the correct result in other cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'INFINITY' when 'z' has a non-zero imaginary part, while the original code fragment returns the correct result in other cases.

DONE.
