  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i--` operator will decrement the value of `i` by 1, whereas the original code fragment `cb(null, i++)` will increment the value of `i` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i * 2` expression will double the value of `i`, whereas the original code fragment `cb(null, i++)` will increment the value of `i` by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i + 1` expression will add 1 to the value of `i`, whereas the original code fragment `cb(null, i++)` will increment the value of `i` by 1.

DONE.
