  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if it is not an object. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `lastOp.insert` is undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp.insert` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this new code fragment checks if `lastOp.delete` is undefined. This would cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp.delete` is undefined.
