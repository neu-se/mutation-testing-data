  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a different URL than the one in the original code, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com/path/to/resource"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a URL with a different path than the one in the original code, which could cause it to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com?query=param"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would receive a URL with a different query parameter than the one in the original code, which could cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
