  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, even if `process` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `process` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, even if `process.emit` is an object.

DONE.
