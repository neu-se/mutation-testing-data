  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is not a valid event listener, and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not handle the error, and would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.on('error', (err) => { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
