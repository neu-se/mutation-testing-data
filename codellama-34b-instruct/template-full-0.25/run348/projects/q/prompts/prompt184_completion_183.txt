  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "1" instead of a number, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return null instead of a number, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return undefined instead of a number, which could cause issues in the surrounding code.

DONE.
