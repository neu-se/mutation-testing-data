  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the newline character with a carriage return character, which would cause the string to be formatted differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the newline character with an empty string, which would cause the string to be formatted differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the newline character with a space character, which would cause the string to be formatted differently.

DONE.
