  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined && match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `prop` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== match[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `prop` is not equal to `match[index + 1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `match[index + 1]` is not equal to
