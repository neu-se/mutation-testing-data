  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any policies with a falsy name, instead of mapping over the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with all but the first element of the original array, instead of mapping over the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the elements in the opposite order of the original array, instead of mapping over the entire array.

DONE.
