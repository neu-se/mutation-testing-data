 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'INFINITY' when 'z' is infinite, while the original code correctly checks if only one of the operands is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'NAN' when the divisor is zero, while the original code handles the case where both the dividend and divisor are zero separately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly calculate the real part of the result when the divisor is complex. The original code calculates the real part correctly using the formula (a^2 - b^2) / (c^2 + d^2).

DONE.
