  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function. Instead, the `end + 1` expression would be passed, which could result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function. Instead, the `end - 1` expression would be passed, which could result in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the `cb` function. Instead, the `end * 2` expression would be passed, which could result in a different value being returned.

DONE.
