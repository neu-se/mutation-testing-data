  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `a`, making the final result different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the result of `b`, making the final result different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply `a` by `b`, making the final result different.

DONE.
