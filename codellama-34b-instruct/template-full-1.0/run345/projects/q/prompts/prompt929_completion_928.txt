  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.nbind(/* ...args*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls a different function than the original code fragment, which could cause the application to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(/* ...args*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the arguments to the existing arguments, rather than prepending them, which could cause the function to receive a different set of arguments than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(/* ...args*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a subset of the arguments, rather than the full set, which could cause the function to receive a different set of arguments than expected.

DONE.
