  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allResolved"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it does not return a promise for an array of states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it does not return a promise for an array of states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"all"
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different method than `allSettled`, and it does not return a promise for an array of states.

DONE.
