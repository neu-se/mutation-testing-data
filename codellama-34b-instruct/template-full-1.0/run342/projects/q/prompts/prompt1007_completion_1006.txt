  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice` is a built-in method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `-1` is a negative number that could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice` is a built-in method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `undefined` is a primitive value that could cause an error or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array_slice` is a built-in method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `hello world` is a string constant that would cause an error or unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
