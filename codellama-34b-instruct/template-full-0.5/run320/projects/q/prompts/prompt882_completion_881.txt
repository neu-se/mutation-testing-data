  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that resolves the promise, whereas `fail` is a method that rejects the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a new promise, whereas `fail` is a method that rejects the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that handles errors, whereas `fail` is a method that rejects the promise.

DONE.
