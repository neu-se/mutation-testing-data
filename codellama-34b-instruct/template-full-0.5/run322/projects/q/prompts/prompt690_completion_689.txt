  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, whereas `void 0` is a more explicit way of representing undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `void 0`, and could potentially cause errors if the code relies on the value of `this` being undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined, array_slice(arguments)]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `void 0`, and could potentially cause errors if the code relies on the value of `this` being undefined.

DONE.
