  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `array` is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `array` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if `array` is empty.

DONE.
