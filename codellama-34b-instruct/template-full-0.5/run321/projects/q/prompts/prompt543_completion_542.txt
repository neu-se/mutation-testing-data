  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive `array` as the `this` value, rather than `void 0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive `null` as the `this` value, rather than `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would receive `undefined` as the `this` value, rather than `void 0`.

DONE.
