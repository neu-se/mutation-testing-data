  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData, baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData, opData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `invert` method to return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
