  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the word as it is, while this replacement checks the word after converting it to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the word as it is, while this replacement checks the length of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking the word as it is, while this replacement checks the first character of the word.

DONE.
