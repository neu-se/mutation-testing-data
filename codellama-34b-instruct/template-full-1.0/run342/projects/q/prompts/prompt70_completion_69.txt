  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload would now be `1` instead of `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload would now be `null` instead of `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the message payload would now be `Infinity` instead of `0`.

DONE.
