  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method without an argument returns the next op in the iterator, while the `next(2)` method returns the next 2 ops in the iterator. This would cause the code to skip over one op, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next op in the iterator, while the `next()` method returns the next op. This would cause the code to skip over one op, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength() * 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length
