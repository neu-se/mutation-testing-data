Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it increases the length used for the operation by 1, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation when trying to access elements in `otherIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the length used for the operation by 1, which may lead to missing an operation in `otherIter` if the length is originally 0 or 1, resulting in incorrect delta calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length used for the operation, which could lead to attempting to access more elements than are available in `otherIter`, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in the delta processing.

DONE.
