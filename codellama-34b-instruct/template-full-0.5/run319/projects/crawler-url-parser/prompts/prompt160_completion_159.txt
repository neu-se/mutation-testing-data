  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the URL, including any trailing slashes, instead of removing the last part of the URL and any trailing slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the URL and any trailing slashes, but would also remove any backslashes that may be present in the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last part of the URL and any trailing slashes, but would also remove any dot characters that may be present in the URL.

DONE.
