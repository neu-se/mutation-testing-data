  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.concat()` concatenates two `Delta` objects, resulting in a new `Delta` object with the same delta, whereas `delta.chop()` returns the same `Delta` object with a reduced length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.truncate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.truncate()` returns a new `Delta` object with no padding, whereas `delta.chop()` reduces the length of the existing `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the `Delta` object, whereas `delta.chop()` reduces the length of the `Delta` object without removing any elements.

DONE.
