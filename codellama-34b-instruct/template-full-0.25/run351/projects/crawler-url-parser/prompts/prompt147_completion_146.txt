  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using every character in the string as a separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ").filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the separator, while the new code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using every character in the string as a separator, and then filters out any empty strings from the resulting array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(" ").filter(function(elem) { return elem.length > 0; })
