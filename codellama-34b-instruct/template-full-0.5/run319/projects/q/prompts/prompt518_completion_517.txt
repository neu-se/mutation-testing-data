  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the progress of the promise instead of rejecting it, which would cause the promise to be in a pending state instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject("error")` would reject the promise with a specific error message, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a specific error instead of being rejected without a specific error.

DONE.
