Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_push(messages, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of adding the arguments to the existing `messages` array, it would create a new array with each call, leading to a loss of the original message order and potentially causing issues when resolving the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take the first argument passed to `promise.promiseDispatch`, ignoring any additional arguments that may be necessary for the operation, which could lead to incorrect promise handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(function(arg) { return arg; }, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with the same elements as `arguments`, but the use of `array_map` is unnecessary and could introduce performance overhead, while also potentially altering the expected structure of the `messages` array.

DONE.
