  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point as the radius, which would result in an incorrect calculation for the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the radius of the second point, which would result in an incorrect calculation for the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the radii of the two points, which would result in an incorrect calculation for the bearing.

DONE.
