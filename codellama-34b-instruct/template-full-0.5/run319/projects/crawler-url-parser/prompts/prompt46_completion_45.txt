  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.format` returns a string representing the URL, while `URL.parse` returns an object representing the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` returns a string representing the resolved URL, while `URL.format` returns a string representing the formatted URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.href` returns a string representing the URL, while `URL.format` returns a string representing the formatted URL.

DONE.
