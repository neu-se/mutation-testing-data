  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function expects a positive integer as its first argument, and passing `0` would cause the promise to be immediately rejected with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function expects a positive integer as its first argument, and passing a negative integer would cause the promise to be immediately rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function expects a positive integer as its first argument, and passing `NaN` would cause the promise to be immediately rejected with an error.

DONE.
