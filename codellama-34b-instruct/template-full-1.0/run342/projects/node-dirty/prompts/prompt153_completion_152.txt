  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` would cause the write stream to close, unlike `uncork()` which would resume writing after being paused. This would likely cause errors in the application that relies on the write stream being open.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write('Dummy data' + '\n');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write dummy data to the write stream, whereas the original code fragment would only write data that was actually read from the read stream. This could cause the application to behave differently, such as by generating different output files or overwriting existing data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would write `null` to the write stream, whereas the original code fragment would only write non-null values. This could cause the application to behave differently, such as by generating
