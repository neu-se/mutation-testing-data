  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is negated, which would flip the result of the `test` function. If `test` returns `true`, `!data` would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `data`. This would cause the `test` function to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the test to pass or fail incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"something_else"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value of `data` with a string. This would cause the `test` function to evaluate to a different value, potentially causing the test to pass or fail incorrectly.

DONE.
