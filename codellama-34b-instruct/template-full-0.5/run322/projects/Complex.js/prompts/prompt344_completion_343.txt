  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `-b` returns the negative value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `b+1` returns the value of `b` plus 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` returns the value of the variable `b`, while the modified code fragment `2*b` returns the value of `b` multiplied by 2.

DONE.
