  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would save one less character than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would save two less characters than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code would use the `slice()` method instead of subtracting one from the length.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
