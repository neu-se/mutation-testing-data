  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections.push(promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `trackUnhandledRejections` was not defined in the original code, and this replacement would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `untrackRejection` was not defined in the original code, and this replacement would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections.push(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `trackUnhandledRejections` was not defined in the original code, and this replacement would cause a reference error.

DONE.
