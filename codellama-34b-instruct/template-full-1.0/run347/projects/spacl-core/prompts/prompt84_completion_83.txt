  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` will return a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` will return a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the `clone` method is expecting a new policy with a deep copy of the underlying rules, and changing the function to `filter` would result in a different copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` will return a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `map` will return a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the `clone` method is expecting a new policy with a deep copy of the underlying rules, and changing the function to `slice` would result in a different copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
