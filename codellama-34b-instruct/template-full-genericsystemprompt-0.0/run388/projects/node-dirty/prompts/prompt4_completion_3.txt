  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, while `delete` only removes the element at the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with `undefined` as the value would set the value at the specified key to `undefined`, while `delete` would remove the element at the specified key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` would remove the element at the specified key, while `set()` with `undefined` as the value would set the value at the specified key to `undefined`.

DONE.
