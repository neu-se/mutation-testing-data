 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledReasons` array slice would receive an integer as the second argument instead of `1`, causing it to slice the array from the index of the removed rejection up to the specified number of elements, instead of slicing just one element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.splice` would remove all elements from the index until the end of the array, instead of removing just one element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.splice` would remove no elements, leaving the `unhandledReasons` array with an extra element referring to the reason of the unhandled rejection.

DONE.
