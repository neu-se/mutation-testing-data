  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment is a reference to a function that returns a function. This change would result in different behavior when the `next` function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment is null. This change would result in different behavior when the `next` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the new code fragment is undefined. This change would result in different behavior when the `next` function is called.

DONE.
