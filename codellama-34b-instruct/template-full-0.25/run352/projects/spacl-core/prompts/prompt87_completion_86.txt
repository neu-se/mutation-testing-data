  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive a `null` argument, which would cause it to throw an error instead of returning a cloned rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive an `undefined` argument, which would cause it to return a cloned rule with an `undefined` name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(rule.name + '1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would receive a different name argument, which would cause it to return a cloned rule with a different name.

DONE.
