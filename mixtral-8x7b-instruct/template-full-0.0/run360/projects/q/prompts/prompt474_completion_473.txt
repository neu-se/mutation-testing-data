 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reportedUnhandledRejections.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array is not properly updated, causing incorrect handling of rejection events.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop` method removes the last element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, causing the loss of information about the handled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reportedUnhandledRejections.push(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array is modified with an unrelated value, causing inconsistent tracking of handled rejections.

DONE.
