  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an additional line break to be inserted into the stack trace, which could potentially affect the parsing of the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a tab character to be inserted into the stack trace, which could potentially affect the parsing of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the stack trace to be empty, which could potentially cause errors in the code that relies on the stack trace.

DONE.
