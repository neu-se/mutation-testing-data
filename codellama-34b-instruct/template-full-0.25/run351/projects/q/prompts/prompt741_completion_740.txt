  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be passed to the `deferred.reject` method, which would reject the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be passed to the `deferred.resolve` method, which would fulfill the promise with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be passed to the `deferred.notify` method, which would notify the promise with the rejection reason.

DONE.
