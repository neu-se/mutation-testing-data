  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the backslash character is not a path separator, so the pattern would not match any path with a backslash in it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the double backslash would result in a single backslash, which is not a valid path separator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/_'
```
This would result in different behavior because the underscore character is not a path separator, so the pattern would not match any path with an underscore in it.

DONE.
