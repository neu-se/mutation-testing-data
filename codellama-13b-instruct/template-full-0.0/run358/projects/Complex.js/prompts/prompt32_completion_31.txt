This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to true, causing the function to always return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to false, causing the function to always return 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to false, causing the function to always return 1.

DONE.
