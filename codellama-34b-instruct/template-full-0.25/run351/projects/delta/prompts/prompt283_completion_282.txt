  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if a substring is present in a string, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastIndexOf` returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring in a string, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, while `indexOf` returns the index of the first match.

DONE.
