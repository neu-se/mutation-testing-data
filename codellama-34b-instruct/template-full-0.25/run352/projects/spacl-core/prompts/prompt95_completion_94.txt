  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would attempt to set the value of the `policy` property to `null`, which would cause an error if the `policy` property is not nullable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would attempt to set the value of the `policy` property to `undefined`, which would cause an error if the `policy` property is not nullable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would attempt to set the value of the `policy` property to the name of the `policy` object, which would cause an error if the `policy` property is not a string.

DONE.
