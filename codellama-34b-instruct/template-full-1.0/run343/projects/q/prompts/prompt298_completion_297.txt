  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.join(that, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `join` method is only called on `x` and `y`, but in this modified code, it is called on `x`, `y`, and `promise`. This could potentially lead to a different output or behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.join(that, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `join` is called as a method on `x` and `y`, but in this modified code, it is called as a method on `promise`. This could potentially lead to a different output or behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
that.join(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `join` is called on `x` and `y`, but in this modified code, it is called on `
