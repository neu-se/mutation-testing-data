  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearer(reject(reason))
```
This would result in different behavior because `nearer` is a function that returns a promise, and `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise. In the original code, `nearerValue` is assigned the result of `nearer(resolvedPromise)`, which is a promise. By replacing it with `nearer(reject(reason))`, the code would now be assigning the result of `nearer` to `nearerValue`, which is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `nearerValue` is assigned the result of `nearer(resolvedPromise)`, which is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill` is a function that returns a ful
