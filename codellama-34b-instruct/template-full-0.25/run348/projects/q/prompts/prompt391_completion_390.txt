  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, while the new code fragment `function () {}` is a function that does nothing, so it would not have the same effect on the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { return value + 1; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, while the new code fragment `function (value) { return value + 1; }` is a function that returns the progress value plus 1, so it would have a different effect on the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) { throw new Error("test"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, while the new code fragment `function
