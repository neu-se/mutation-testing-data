  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (inspection) {
    return inspection.value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise, rather than the inspection object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (inspection) {
    return inspection.state;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise, rather than the inspection object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.then(function (inspection) {
    return inspection.reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason for the promise's rejection, rather than the inspection object.

DONE.
