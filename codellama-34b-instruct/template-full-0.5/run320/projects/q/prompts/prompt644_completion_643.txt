  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` creates a fulfilled promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a deferred promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a pending promise instead of a fulfilled or rejected one.

DONE.
