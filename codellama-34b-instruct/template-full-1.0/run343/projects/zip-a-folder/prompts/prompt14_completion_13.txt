  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because R_OK (read) permission is being checked, while W_OK (write) permission is being checked instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because R_OK (read) permission is being checked, while X_OK (execute) permission is being checked instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because R_OK (read) permission is being checked, while F_OK (file exists) permission is being checked instead.

DONE.
