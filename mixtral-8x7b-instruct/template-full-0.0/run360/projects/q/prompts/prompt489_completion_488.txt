 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would always execute its first statement, setting `trackUnhandledRejections` to `true`, even if it was passed a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'trackUnhandledRejections'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would attempt to set the `length` property of a string, which is not allowed and would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resetUnhandledRejections` function would attempt to set the `length` property of a function, which is not allowed and would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
