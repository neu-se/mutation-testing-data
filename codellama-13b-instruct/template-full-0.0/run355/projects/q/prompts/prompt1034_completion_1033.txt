  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the current line number, while the buggy code fragment does not. This could cause issues with stack traces and debugging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
qEndingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the current line number, while the buggy code fragment captures the line number of the `qEndingLine` variable. This could cause issues with stack traces and debugging.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment captures the current line number, while the buggy code fragment does not. This could cause issues with stack traces and debugging.

DONE.
