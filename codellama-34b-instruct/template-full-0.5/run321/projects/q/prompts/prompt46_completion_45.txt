  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit(1)` would terminate the Node.js process, whereas the original code would continue executing the next tick.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown synchronously, whereas the original code would throw the error asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Test log");
```
This would result in different behavior because the log message would be printed synchronously, whereas the original code would print the message asynchronously.

DONE.
