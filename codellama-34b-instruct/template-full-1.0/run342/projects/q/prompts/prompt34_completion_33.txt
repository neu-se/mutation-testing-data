  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function, and adding 1 to a function will result in a different value than simply calling the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task()
```
This would result in different behavior because `task` is a function, and calling the function will execute the code within the function, which may have different behavior than simply returning the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of any other value, and returning `undefined` would indicate that the task is not defined, which may cause errors in the code that uses the return value.

DONE.
