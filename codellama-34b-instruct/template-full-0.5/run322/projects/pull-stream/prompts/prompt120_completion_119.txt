  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`. In the original code, `null` is used to indicate that the data is not available, while `undefined` means that the value is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : ''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is not the same as `null`. In the original code, `null` is used to indicate that the data is not available, while `''` is an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end === true ? null : NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not the same as `null`. In the original code, `null` is used to indicate that the data is not available, while `NaN` is a special value used to represent "not a number".

DONE.
