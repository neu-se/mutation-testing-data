  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args === undefined` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `args` is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would always be `0` if `args` is an empty array, regardless of whether it is `null` or `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` would always be `undefined` if `args` is an empty array, regardless of whether it is `null` or `undefined`.

DONE.
