  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.freeze
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.freeze` freezes an object and its properties, making them unable to be changed, while `Object.keys` returns an array of the object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.

DONE.
