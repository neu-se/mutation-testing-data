  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number plus one instead of just the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the imaginary and real parts of the complex number instead of just the imaginary part.

DONE.
