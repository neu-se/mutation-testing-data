Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the addition of an infinite complex number to zero, which should normally return infinity, but instead would return a finite result if `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check if the current complex number is not infinite, potentially allowing an operation that should return infinity to return a finite result instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return infinity if both the current complex number is zero and the other is infinite, which is a more restrictive condition than the original check, leading to incorrect results in cases where one of the numbers is infinite.

DONE.
