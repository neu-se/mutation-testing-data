  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `reason`, instead of using the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() { return reason; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `reason`, instead of using the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `undefined`, instead of using the original promise.

DONE.
