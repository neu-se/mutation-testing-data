  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.id
```
This would result in different behavior because `c.id` is a string, while `c` is an object. The `getCountry` function expects an object as its first argument, so passing a string would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `c.name` is a string, while `c` is an object. The `getCountry` function expects an object as its first argument, so passing a string would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c.timezones[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `c.timezones[0]` is an object, while `c` is an object. The `getCountry` function expects an object as its first argument, so passing an object would cause an error.

DONE.
