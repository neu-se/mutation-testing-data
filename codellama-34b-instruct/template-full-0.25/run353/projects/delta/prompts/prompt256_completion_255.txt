  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check for equality of attributes, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) || thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the insert values are equal or if the attributes are not equal, which is not the same as checking if the insert values are equal and the attributes are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the insert values are equal and the attributes are not equal, which is not the same as checking if the insert values are equal and the attributes are equal.
