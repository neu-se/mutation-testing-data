  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object. In the original code, `exception` is passed to `isStopIteration`, which checks if it is an instance of `QReturnValue`. However, if `exception.message` is passed instead, it will not be an instance of `QReturnValue`, and the function will return `false`, even if `exception` is actually an instance of `QReturnValue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.stack` is a string, while `exception` is an object. In the original code, `exception` is passed to `isStopIteration`, which checks if it is an instance of `QReturnValue`. However, if `exception.stack` is passed instead, it will not be an instance of `QReturnValue`, and the function will return `false`, even if `exception` is actually an instance of `Q
