 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the stack trace to a string, losing the ability to filter out unwanted frames.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `promise.stack` property, which might not exist or contain the desired information in different environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error().stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Error object and gets its stack property, which would not be related to the original error or promise.

DONE.
