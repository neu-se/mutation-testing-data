  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b[key]` returns the value stored in the `key` property of the `b` object, while the modified code fragment `b[key] + 1` returns the value stored in the `key` property of the `b` object plus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b[key]` returns the value stored in the `key` property of the `b` object, while the modified code fragment `b[key] * 2` returns the value stored in the `key` property of the `b` object multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b[key]` returns the value stored in the `key`
