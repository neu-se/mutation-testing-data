  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')`, which adds a rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria". However, the new code fragment `addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')` would result in the word "bacterium" being pluralized as "bacterium" instead, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')`, which adds a rule for the word "bacterium" to be pluralized as "bacteria". However, the new code fragment `addRule('bacterium', 'bacteriums')` would result in the word "bacterium" being pluralized as "bacteriums
