  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the resulting pluralization would be incorrect for words that end with "o" but not "ouy".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the resulting pluralization would be incorrect for words that end with "o" but not "ouy".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(fe?)$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/e?$/, 'es') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and the resulting pluralization would be incorrect for words that end with
