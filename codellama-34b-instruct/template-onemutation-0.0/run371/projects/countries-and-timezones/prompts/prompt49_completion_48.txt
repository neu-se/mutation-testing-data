  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `forEach` simply calls the provided function on every element in the calling array. In this case, the function passed to `map` is `getTimezone`, which returns a timezone object if it exists, and `null` otherwise. Therefore, the `map` method will return an array of timezone objects, while the `forEach` method will simply call the `getTimezone` function on each element in the `data.timezones` array, but will not return anything.

DONE.
