  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data.timezones[name])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with a different argument, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data.timezones[name].name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with a different argument, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data.timezones[name].country)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezone` function with a different argument, which could potentially return a different result.

DONE.
