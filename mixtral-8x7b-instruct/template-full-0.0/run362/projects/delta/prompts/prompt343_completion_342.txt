 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.getPrototypeOf(Delta).getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the handler from the prototype of the Delta class, which might not have the desired effect if the handler is overridden in the class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.getHandler
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `getHandler` method from the `delta` object, which might not exist or have the same behavior as the original `Delta.getHandler`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random().toString().slice(2, 7).padEnd(10, '0').concat('.getHandler')
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random string and concatenates it with '.getHandler', which would lead to a non-existent method being called, causing an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
