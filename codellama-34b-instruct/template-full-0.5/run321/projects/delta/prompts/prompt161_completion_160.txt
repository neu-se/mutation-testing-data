  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other` iterator with a specific length, which may not be the same as the length of the `this` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the `other` iterator in the opposite direction, which may not be the same as the direction of the `this` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.seek(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would seek to a specific position in the `other` iterator, which may not be the same as the position of the `this` iterator.

DONE.
