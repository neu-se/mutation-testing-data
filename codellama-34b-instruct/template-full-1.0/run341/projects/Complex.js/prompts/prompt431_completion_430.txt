  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (this['re'] * places)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the reciprocal of the expression, which would produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['re'] + this['im']) * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number before multiplying by `places`.

DONE.
