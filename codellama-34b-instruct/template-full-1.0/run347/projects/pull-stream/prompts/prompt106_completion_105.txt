  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(new Error("Simulated error"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is called with an error, which would be detected by the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, "Hello");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is called with different arguments, which would be detected by the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done("Hello");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` callback is called with different arguments, which would be detected by the test suite.

DONE.
