 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / (end || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is falsy, it would now throw a division-by-zero error instead of continuing execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because if `end` is not a string, it would now return `undefined` instead of the original value of `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would now reference a global variable called `end`, instead of the `end` parameter of the inner function.

DONE.
