  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(1)` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `1`, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with no value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfill(new Error())` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with an error value, whereas `fulfill` would cause it to be fulfilled with no value.

DONE.
