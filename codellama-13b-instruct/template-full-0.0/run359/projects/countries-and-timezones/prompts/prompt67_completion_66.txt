  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the country object with the given ID, while the modified code fragment returns the country object with the given ID and the options object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the country object with the given ID, while the modified code fragment returns the name of the country with the given ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id].timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the country object with the given ID, while the modified code fragment returns the timezones of the country with the given ID.

DONE.
