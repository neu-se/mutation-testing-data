  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let verb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would declare a new `verb` variable within the function scope, rather than using the `verb` argument passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb = 'GET'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the value of `verb` to `'GET'`, regardless of the actual value passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `verb` property from the `verbs` object, rather than setting it to `true` or `false` as expected.

DONE.
