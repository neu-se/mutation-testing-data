  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```options.encoding```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and it is only used in the `fromCallback` function. By passing `options.encoding` as the encoding parameter, the `fromCallback` function will not be able to determine the proper encoding for the file, which could result in incorrect data being read or written.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```void 0```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to represent `undefined` in JavaScript. By passing `void 0` as the encoding parameter, the `fromCallback` function will assume that the file is binary and will not attempt to decode it as text. This could result in incorrect data being read or written.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```null```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a way to represent a null pointer or a non-existent value in JavaScript. By passing `null` as
