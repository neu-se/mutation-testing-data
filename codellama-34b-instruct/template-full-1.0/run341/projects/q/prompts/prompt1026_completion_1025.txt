  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical not operator `!` would return the opposite boolean value of `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `object` would be incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `object` would be converted to a string.

DONE.
