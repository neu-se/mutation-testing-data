 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error or true value from the read callback to the last callback, while this change would always pass false to the last callback, potentially hiding errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
