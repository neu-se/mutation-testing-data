  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!==
```
This would result in different behavior because when `Array.prototype.split()` is called with a search value of `==` or `===`, it would return an array with a single element, the original string, because the search value would not match any part of the string. By replacing `==` with `!==`, the search value would match the string, and the array returned would be empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
,
```
This would result in different behavior because when `String.prototype.includes()` is called with a search string that is a single character, such as `=`, it would search for the character in the string, and return `true` if the character is found, or `false` if it is not. By replacing the search string with `,`, which is a comma, the function would search for the comma in the string, and return `true` if it is found, or `false` if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
