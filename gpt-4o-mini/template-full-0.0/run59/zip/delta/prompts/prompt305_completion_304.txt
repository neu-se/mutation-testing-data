Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the predicate function when the line is empty, which is the opposite of the original intent that only calls the predicate when there is content in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number of operations in the line is greater than one, potentially skipping the predicate call when there is exactly one operation, which may lead to missing important processing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.ops.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an invalid condition (length cannot be negative), which would always evaluate to false, thus preventing the predicate from being called regardless of the content of the line.

DONE.
