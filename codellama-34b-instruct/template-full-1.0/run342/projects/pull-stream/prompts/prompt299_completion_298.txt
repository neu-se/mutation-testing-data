  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if the callback (`cb`) is truthy before calling it, while the mutated code is checking if it is falsy before calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is passing only one argument to the callback, while the mutated code is passing two arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is passing a different value to the callback, while the mutated code is passing the value of the `ended` variable.

DONE.
