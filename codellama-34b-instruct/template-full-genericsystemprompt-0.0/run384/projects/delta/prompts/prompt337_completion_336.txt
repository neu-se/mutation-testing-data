  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a slice of the base delta that excludes the last element, which would cause the algorithm to miss the last element in the base delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a slice of the base delta that includes one more element than the original code, which would cause the algorithm to include an extra element in the transformed delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would return a slice of the base delta that starts one element after the original code, which would cause the algorithm to skip the first element in the base delta.

DONE.
