  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` is the absolute value of `a`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`. In the original code, `_b` is used to compute the logarithm of the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs `a` and `b`, while `_a` is used to compute the logarithm of the opposite side. Replacing `_b` with `_a` would cause the function to compute the logarithm of the wrong side, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
