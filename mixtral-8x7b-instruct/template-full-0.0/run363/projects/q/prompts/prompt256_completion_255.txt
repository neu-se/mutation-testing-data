 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` function would immediately return instead of resolving the promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(value)` call inside the `become` function would treat the `null` value as a rejection reason, causing the promise to be rejected instead of being resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q(value)` call inside the `become` function would treat the `deferred` object as a rejection reason, causing the promise to be rejected instead of being resolved.

DONE.
