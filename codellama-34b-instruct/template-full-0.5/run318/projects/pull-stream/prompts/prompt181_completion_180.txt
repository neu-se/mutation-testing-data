  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment simply referred to the function without calling it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` is a method that calls a function, and it would execute the function with the current value of `this` as the context, whereas the original code fragment simply referred to the function without calling it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply()` is a method that calls a function, and it would execute the function with the current value of `this` as the context, and it would also allow passing arguments to the function, whereas the original code fragment simply referred to the function without calling it.

DONE.
