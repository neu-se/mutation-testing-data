 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` object would not be resolved, causing the `get` method to hang and not propagate errors correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Unexpected closure'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the `end` object with a different error message, causing the `get` method to throw an unexpected error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{head: Q.resolve(), tail: Q.resolve()}
