 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the entire fragment part of the URL (starting with '#'), instead of just the part after '#'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace(/\#.*/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a regex literal with a backslash before '#', which would not treat '#' as a special character. This would result in the entire fragment part of the URL being preserved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr.replace('##', '');
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the literal string '##' with an empty string, instead of removing the fragment part of the URL.

DONE.
