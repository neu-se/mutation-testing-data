  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would trigger the progress notification of the deferred, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.observe
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.observe` would observe the deferred and trigger the progress notification, whereas `deferred.reject` would reject the promise with the given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(reason + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a different reason, causing the promise's behavior to be different from the original code.

DONE.
