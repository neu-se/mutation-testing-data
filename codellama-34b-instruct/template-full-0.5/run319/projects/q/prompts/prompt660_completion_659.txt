  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `resolve` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
