Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split(",")
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the delimiter from "/" to ",", which would lead to incorrect parsing of the URL path, resulting in an entirely different array of parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("").filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because it splits the path into individual characters instead of segments, leading to an array of single-character strings rather than meaningful path segments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/").map(part => part.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts each segment of the path to uppercase, which could affect subsequent comparisons and logic that rely on case sensitivity.

DONE.
