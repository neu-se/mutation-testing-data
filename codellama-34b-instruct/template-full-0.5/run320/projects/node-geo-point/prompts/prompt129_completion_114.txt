  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a `Tile` object, while the new code returns `null`. This change would cause any code that relies on the return value of `toTile` to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(0, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a `Tile` object with non-zero coordinates, while the new code returns a `Tile` object with zero coordinates. This change would cause any code that relies on the coordinates of the returned `Tile` object to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Tile(1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a `Tile` object with non-zero coordinates, while the new code returns a `Tile` object with coordinates that are one unit away from the origin. This change would cause any
