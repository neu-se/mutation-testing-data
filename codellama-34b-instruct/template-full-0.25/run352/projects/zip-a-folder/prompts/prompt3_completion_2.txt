  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the format is changed from 'tar' to 'zip', which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level is changed from the default 'high' to 'uncompressed', which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {customWriteStream: fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath)}}
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom write stream is used instead of the default write stream, which could
