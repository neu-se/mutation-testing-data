  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 1; index <= count; index++
```
This change will cause the loop to start at 1 instead of 0, which may cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count - 1; index++
```
This change will cause the loop to end at the second-to-last element in the array instead of the last element, which may cause the loop to skip the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let index = 0; index < count; index += 2
```
This change will cause the loop to skip every other element in the array, which may cause the loop to miss certain elements.

DONE.
