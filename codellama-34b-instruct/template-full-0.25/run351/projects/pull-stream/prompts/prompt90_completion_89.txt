  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, so if the `test` function returned `true`, the `!test(data)` expression would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression `test(data) && false` would first evaluate `test(data)` and then evaluate `false`, resulting in `false` regardless of the result of `test(data)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the expression `test(data) || true` would first evaluate `test(data)` and then evaluate `true`,
