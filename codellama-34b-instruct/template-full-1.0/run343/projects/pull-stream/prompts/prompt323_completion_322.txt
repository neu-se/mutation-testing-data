  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always calls the `onEnd` callback with `true`, whereas the original code only calls it with `true` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition for calling the `onEnd` callback, whereas the original code only calls it if `onEnd` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd ? abort : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `onEnd` callback with `abort` if `onEnd` is falsy, whereas the original code calls it with `null` if `onEnd` is falsy.

DONE.
