  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method to send a message to the object, while "get" would retrieve a property value from the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"send"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method to send a message to the object, while "send" would send a message to the object without expecting a response.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "post" method to send a message to the object, while "apply" would apply a function to a set of arguments, without sending a message to the object.

DONE.
