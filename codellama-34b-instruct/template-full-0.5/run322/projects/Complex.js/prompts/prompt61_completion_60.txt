  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isFinite` will always return `true` when the input is a number, whereas `Number.isFinite` will return `false` when the input is `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` will always return `false` when the input is a number, whereas `!Number.isFinite` will return `true` when the input is `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === b` will always return `false` when the input is a number, whereas `Number.isFinite` and `!Number.isFinite` will return `true` when the input is `NaN`.

DONE.
