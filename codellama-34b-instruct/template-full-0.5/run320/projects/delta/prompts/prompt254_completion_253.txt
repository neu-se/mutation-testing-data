  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance by `opLength` elements, which may not be the correct number of elements to advance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance by `length` elements, which may not be the correct number of elements to advance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration to advance by one fewer element than the correct number of elements to advance.

DONE.
