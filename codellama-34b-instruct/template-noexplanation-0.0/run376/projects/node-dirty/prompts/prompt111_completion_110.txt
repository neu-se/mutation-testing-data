  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it removes the last character of the `buffer` before creating the error message. This could potentially cause the error message to be different than the original, which could reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it converts the `buffer` to uppercase before creating the error message. This could potentially cause the error message to be different than the original, which could reveal a weakness in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original
