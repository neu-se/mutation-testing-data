Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context in which `hasOwnProperty` is called, potentially leading to incorrect results when checking for properties on objects that do not inherit from `Object.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable
```
This would result in different behavior because `propertyIsEnumerable` checks if a property is enumerable, which is not the same as checking if a property exists, leading to false negatives for non-enumerable properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` does not check for property existence but instead returns a string representation of the object, which would not fulfill the intended purpose of checking if an object has a specific property.

DONE.
