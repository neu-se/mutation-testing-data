  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object, while `typeof b !== 'undefined'` checks if `b` is not undefined. If `b` is undefined, the original code would return an empty object, while the modified code would return `undefined`.

DONE.
