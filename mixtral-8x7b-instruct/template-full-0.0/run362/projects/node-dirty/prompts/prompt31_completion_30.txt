 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback `cb` will not be called when the key is removed, unlike the original implementation that calls the callback when the value is set to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rm` method will not remove the key-value pair from the `_data` map, unlike the original implementation that uses `this._data.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.set('dummy', cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new key-value pair to the `_queue` map, which is not the intended behavior of the `rm` method. The original implementation uses `this._queue.get(key)` to retrieve the list of callbacks associated with the given key and then removes the key if the list is empty.
