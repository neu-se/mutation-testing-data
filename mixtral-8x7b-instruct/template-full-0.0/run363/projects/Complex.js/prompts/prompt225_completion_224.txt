 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is an abstract equality comparison that allows type coercion, while `===` is a strict equality comparison that does not allow type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1/b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the reciprocal of `b` is equal to 0, which is not the same as checking if `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.is(b, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.is()` is a stricter comparison than `===`, which checks for both value and type equality, but also considers `-0` and `0` as not equal, and `NaN` as equal to itself.

DONE.
