 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables tracking of unhandled rejections, which is different from the original `resetUnhandledRejections` function that resets the state of unhandled rejections and allows tracking to be enabled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackUnhandledRejections = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable to `undefined` instead of resetting it to `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete trackUnhandledRejections;
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable instead of resetting it to `true`, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the unhandled rejection tracking mechanism.

DONE
