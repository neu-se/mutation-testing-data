 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the input object, which may not have the same behavior as the original object if mutations occur.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
