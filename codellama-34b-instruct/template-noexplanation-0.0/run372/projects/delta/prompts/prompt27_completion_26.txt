  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length
```
This code fragment is a valid replacement for the PLACEHOLDER, as it returns the number of keys in the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This code fragment is also a valid replacement for the PLACEHOLDER, as it checks if the number of keys in the `attributes` object is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes).length === 0
```
This code fragment is a valid replacement for the PLACEHOLDER, as it checks if the number of keys in the `attributes` object is equal to 0.

DONE.
