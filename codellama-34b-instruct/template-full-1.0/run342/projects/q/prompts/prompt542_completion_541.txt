  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` variable is not defined in the function, so it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is not an array, but a map-like object, so the `apply` method would fail to work correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array, so the `apply` method would fail to work correctly.

DONE.
