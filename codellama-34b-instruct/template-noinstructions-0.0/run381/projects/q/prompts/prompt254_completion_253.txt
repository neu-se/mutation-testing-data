  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first element of the `message` array to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all but the first element of the `message` array to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.concat(message)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a concatenated version of the `message` array to `newPromise.promiseDispatch`, instead of passing the original array.

DONE.
