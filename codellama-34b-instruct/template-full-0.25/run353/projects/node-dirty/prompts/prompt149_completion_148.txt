  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the callbacks would be called in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(1)` method returns a new array with all elements except the first one, so the first callback would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== cbs[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, so the first callback would not be called if it is the same as the first element in the `cbs` array.

DONE.
