  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property is not checked in the original code, so the `currentUrl` object would be evaluated as truthy even if it doesn't have a `protocol` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` property is not checked in the original code, so the `currentUrl` object would be evaluated as truthy even if it doesn't have a `host` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property is not checked in the original code, so the `currentUrl` object would be evaluated as truthy even if it doesn't have a `path` property.

DONE.
