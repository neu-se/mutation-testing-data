  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that is not bound to the current object, so it would not have access to the correct `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that is not called with the correct `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that is not applied with the correct `this` context.

DONE.
