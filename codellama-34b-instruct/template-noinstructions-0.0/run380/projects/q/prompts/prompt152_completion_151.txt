  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.split("\n")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first line of the stack trace, which may not be the line that contains the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.split("\n")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second line of the stack trace, which may not be the line that contains the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack.split("\n")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third line of the stack trace, which may not be the line that contains the error.

DONE.
