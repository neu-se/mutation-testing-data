  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` is called with the same arguments as the original code fragment, which would result in the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(pageurl, linkurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` is called with the arguments in a different order, which would result in a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` is called with an additional argument, which would result in a different return value.

DONE.
