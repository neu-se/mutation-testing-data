  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match a backslash instead of a forward slash, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match a forward slash, which is the same as the original code fragment. This change will not cause any significant changes in the code's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\/'
```
This change will cause the regular expression to match a backslash followed by a forward slash, which may cause the code to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
