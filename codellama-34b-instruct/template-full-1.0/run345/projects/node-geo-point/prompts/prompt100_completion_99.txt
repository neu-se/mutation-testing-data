  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return rad2deg(φ2) + 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is not defined anywhere in the code snippet, and the angle would be converted to degrees instead of being wrapped around 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deg2rad(φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is not defined anywhere in the code snippet, and the angle would not be wrapped around 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return φ2 * 180 / Math.PI;
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle would not be converted to degrees, and the multiplication by 180/π would result in a different value.

DONE.
