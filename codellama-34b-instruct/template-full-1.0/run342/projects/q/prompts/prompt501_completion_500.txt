  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `prototype` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `prototype` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access its `prototype` property.

DONE.
