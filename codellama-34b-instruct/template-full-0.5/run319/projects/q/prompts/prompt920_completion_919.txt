  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with `exception` as an argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with that exception, rather than the original code which would have called `deferred.reject` with no arguments.

```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would be called with `value` as an argument, which would cause the promise to be notified with that value, rather than the original code which would have called `de
