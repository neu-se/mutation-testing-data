  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed && !cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!cbed` is checking if `cbed` is false, while the replacement code fragment `cbed && !cbed` is checking if `cbed` is false and then negating it, which would always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!cbed` is checking if `cbed` is false, while the replacement code fragment `cbed || true` is checking if `cbed` is true or if `true` is true, which would always evaluate to true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed ^ true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `!cbed` is checking if `cbed` is false, while the replacement code fragment `cbed ^ true` is performing a bitwise XOR operation on
