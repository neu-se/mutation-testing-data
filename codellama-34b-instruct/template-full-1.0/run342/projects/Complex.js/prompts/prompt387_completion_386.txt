  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` is the function for hyperbolic sine, whereas `cosh` is the function for hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` is the function for hyperbolic sine in the `Math` object, whereas `cosh` is a user-defined function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a => Math.sinh(a) + Math.cosh(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a function that returns the sum of the hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine of the input, whereas `cosh` is a function that returns the hyperbolic cosine of the input.

DONE.
