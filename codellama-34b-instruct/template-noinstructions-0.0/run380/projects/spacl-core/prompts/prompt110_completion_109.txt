  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first verb in the `verbs` array, rather than all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[verbs.length - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last verb in the `verbs` array, rather than all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb = verbs[Math.floor(Math.random() * verbs.length)];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a verb from the `verbs` array, rather than considering all of them.

DONE.
