  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method is now starting from the third element instead of the second, which would cause the `reverse` method to operate on a different set of elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method is now being called on the reversed array, which would cause the resulting string to be concatenated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(x => x.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is now being called on the reversed array, which would cause the resulting array to contain uppercase versions of the original elements.

DONE.
