  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).noop().trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `noop` method is a no-op (no operation) function that does nothing, so the trim method would never be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).context().trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `context` method returns the DOM element that the jQuery object wraps, so the trim method would be called on the element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).getText().trim
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getText` method returns the text content of the element, so the trim method would be called on the text.

DONE.
