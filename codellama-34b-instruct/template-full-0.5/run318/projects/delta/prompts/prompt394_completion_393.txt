  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return 0, regardless of the input, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return one more than the input length, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return one less than the input length, which is not the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
