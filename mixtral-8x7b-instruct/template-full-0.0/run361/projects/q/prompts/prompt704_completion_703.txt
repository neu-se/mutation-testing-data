 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a built-in object that provides access to the arguments passed to a function, while `array_slice` is a custom function for slicing arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the slice method of an empty array, which would not work as expected for slicing the arguments object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Function.prototype.call.bind([].slice)
