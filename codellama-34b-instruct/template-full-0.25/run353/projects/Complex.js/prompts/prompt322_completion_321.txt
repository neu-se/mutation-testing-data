  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `a` as the variable for the real part of the complex number, while the replacement code fragment uses `b` as the variable for the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the product of `a` and `b` as the argument for the `cos` function, while the replacement code fragment uses the sum of `a` and `b` as the argument for the `cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the product of `a` and `b` as the argument for the `cos` function, while the replacement code fragment uses the difference of `a` and `b` as the argument for the `cos` function.

DONE.
