  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `pageurl_path` string to lowercase, which could affect the comparison with the `linkurl_path` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/^\/|\/$/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would remove any leading or trailing slashes from the `pageurl_path` string, which could affect the comparison with the `linkurl_path` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `pageurl_path` string into an array of substrings, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could affect the comparison with the `linkurl_path` string.
