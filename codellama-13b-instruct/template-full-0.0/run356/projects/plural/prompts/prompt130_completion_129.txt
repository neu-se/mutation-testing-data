  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1; i < rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the second element of the `rules` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i <= rules.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would include the last element of the `rules` array, which could cause an error if the last element is not a valid rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < rules.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element of the `rules` array, which could cause the last rule to be ignored.

DONE.
