  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(new Error('error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a new Error object, which would cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a new Error object, which would cause the program to crash or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', 'error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a string message, which would not be handled by the error event listener.

DONE.
