Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` as the replacer will cause `JSON.stringify` to omit all properties of the object, resulting in an empty string instead of the expected JSON representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => null
```
This would result in different behavior because using a function that always returns `null` as the replacer will cause all properties of the object to be replaced with `null`, leading to a JSON string that represents the object as `null` instead of its actual structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'nonexistentProperty'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a string that does not correspond to any property of the object will cause `JSON.stringify` to ignore the object entirely, potentially resulting in a string that does not represent the object as intended.

DONE.
