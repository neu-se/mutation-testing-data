  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would behave as if `busy` was always `false`, even if it was previously `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add `1` to the value of `busy`, so the code would behave as if `busy` was always one greater than its actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would multiply the value of `busy` by `2`, so the code would behave as if `busy` was always twice its actual value.

DONE.
