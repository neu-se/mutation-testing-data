  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` and `fail` are different methods in the Q promise library. `then` is used to handle the resolution of a promise, while `fail` is used to handle the rejection of a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).done
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a method that is used to handle the resolution of a promise, while `fail` is used to handle the rejection of a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that is used to handle the rejection of a promise, while `fail` is used to handle the rejection of a promise.

DONE.
