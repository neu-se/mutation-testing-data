  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/e/, 'a') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is reversed, so "man" would become "maan" instead of "men".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is the same as the original code, so "man" would become "men" again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'o') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is different from the original code, so "man" would become "mon" instead of "men".

DONE.
