 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses a longitude of 0, instead of the actual longitude of point2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the longitude of the current object (point1) instead of point2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a random number instead of the longitude of point2, causing unpredictable results.

DONE.
