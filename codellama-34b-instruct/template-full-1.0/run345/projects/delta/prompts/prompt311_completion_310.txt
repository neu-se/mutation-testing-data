  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would be checking for the value of `i`, but the code would be incrementing `i` before the check. The test case would pass, even though the code is not working as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would be checking for the value of `i`, but the code would be decrementing `i` before the check. The test case would fail, even though the code is working as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * i
```
This would result in different behavior because the test case would be checking for the value of `i`, but the code would be doubling `i` before the check. The test case would fail, even though the code is working as intended.

DONE.
