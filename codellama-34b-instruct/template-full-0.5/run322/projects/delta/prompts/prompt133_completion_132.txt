  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method is being called on the `Op` class, which would return the length of the `Op` object, and adding 1 to it would result in an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method is being called on the `Op` class, which would return the length of the `Op` object, and subtracting 1 from it would result in an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` method is being called on the `Op` class, which would return the length of the `Op` object, and multiplying it by 2 would result in an incorrect value.

DONE.
