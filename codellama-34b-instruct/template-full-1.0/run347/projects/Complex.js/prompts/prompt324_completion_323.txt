  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that represents a complex number, and `-a` would simply negate the value of `a`. In the original code, `a` is used to calculate the complex arcus sinus, and `-a` would calculate the complex arcus sinus of the negated argument, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a variable that represents a different complex number than `a`. In the original code, `a` is used to calculate the complex arcus sinus, and `b` is used to calculate the complex arcus cosinus. If `b` is used instead of `a`, the results would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*a
```
This would result in different behavior because `2*a` is different from `a`. In the original code, `a`
