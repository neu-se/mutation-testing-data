  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would be passed as an argument to `then` instead of `undefined`, which could lead to a different code path being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript, and it would be treated as a truthy value in a conditional statement, which could lead to a different code path being executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript, and it would be treated as a truthy value in a conditional statement, which could lead to a different code path being executed.

DONE.
