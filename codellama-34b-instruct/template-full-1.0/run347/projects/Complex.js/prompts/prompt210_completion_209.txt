  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 <a + b>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `a`, which is not necessarily the same as `a + b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<a * b>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `a`, which is not necessarily the same as `a * b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<a ^ b>
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the absolute value of `a`, which is not necessarily the same as `a ^ b`.

DONE.
