  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the word with "s" to make it plural, but this replacement code fragment would always append "s" to the word, even if it is already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(0, -1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the last letter of the word and replace it with "ies" to make it plural, but this replacement code fragment would always remove the last letter of the word and append "ies" to make it plural, even if the word is already plural.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the last letter of the word and replace it with "ies" to make it plural,
