Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join(targetPath, path.basename(file.name))
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the way the target path is constructed, potentially leading to incorrect file paths and affecting the overall file copying process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be copied to the source directory instead of the target directory, effectively overwriting the original files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname(targetPath)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the file to be copied to the parent directory of the target path, potentially leading to incorrect file paths and affecting the overall file copying process.

DONE.
