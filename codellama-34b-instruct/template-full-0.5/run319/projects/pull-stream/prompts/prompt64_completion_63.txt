  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `done`, so if `done` is `true`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `false`, and if `done` is `false`, the new code fragment would evaluate to `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to execute the opposite branch than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than `==`, so the new code fragment would first evaluate `done && false`, which would result in `false`, regardless of the value of `done`. This would cause the `if` statement to always execute the branch that is after the `&&` operator, which is the branch that throws an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher
