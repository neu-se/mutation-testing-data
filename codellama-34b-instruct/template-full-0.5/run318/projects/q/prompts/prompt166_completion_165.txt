  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the `i` variable instead of incrementing it, leading to a different set of values being passed to the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other iteration, leading to a different set of values being passed to the `isInternalFrame` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over every other value, leading to a different set of values being passed to the `isInternalFrame` function.

DONE.
