  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `unhandledRejections` array would be compared to the `promise` object, rather than the `promise` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method would return the index of the `promise` object in the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than comparing the `promise` object to the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isRejected()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` method would return a boolean indicating whether the `promise` object is rejected, rather than comparing the `promise` object to the `unhandledRejections` array.

DONE
