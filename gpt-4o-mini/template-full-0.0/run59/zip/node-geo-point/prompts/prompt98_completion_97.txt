Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the longitude, potentially leading to incorrect destination coordinates, as it uses the cosine of the bearing instead of the correct tangent calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses the sine of the initial latitude instead of the correct variable, which would lead to an erroneous calculation of the destination longitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would effectively ignore the calculation of the change in longitude and return the original longitude, resulting in an incorrect destination point that does not account for the bearing and distance.

DONE.
