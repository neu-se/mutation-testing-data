  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the length of the subdomain of the link URL is less than the length of the subdomain of the page URL, while the new code fragment checks if the length of the subdomain of the link URL is greater than the length of the subdomain of the page URL. This change in the comparison operator would cause the function to return a different value for the type of the link URL.

DONE.
