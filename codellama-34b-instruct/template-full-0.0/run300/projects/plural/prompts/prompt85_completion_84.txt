  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule for the word "mouse" to the list of rules, while this code fragment would add a new rule for the word "mice" to the list of rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mouse', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule for the word "mouse" to the list of rules, while this code fragment would add a new rule for the word "mouses" to the list of rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule for the word "mouse" to the list of rules, while this code fragment would add a new rule for the word "mice" to the list of rules.

DONE.
