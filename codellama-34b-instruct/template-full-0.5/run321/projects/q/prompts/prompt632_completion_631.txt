  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, "wrong_key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would attempt to delete a different key than the one intended, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["wrong_key"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would attempt to delete a different key than the one intended, which could cause unintended side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `del` method would attempt to delete the same key twice, which could cause unintended side effects.

DONE.
