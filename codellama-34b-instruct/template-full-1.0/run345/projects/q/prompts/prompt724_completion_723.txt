  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){return null;})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to always resolve to `null`, regardless of its original resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){throw "error";})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to always be rejected with the error message "error", regardless of its original resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(){return undefined;})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to always resolve to `undefined`, regardless of its original resolution.

DONE.
