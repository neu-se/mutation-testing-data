Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the file extension of the URL instead of the destination path, which may lead to incorrect handling of the destination filename.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest + '.jpg'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a '.jpg' extension to the destination path, regardless of the actual file type, potentially causing issues when saving files with different formats.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.filename
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a non-existent `filename` property on the `options` object, which would always evaluate to `undefined`, leading to incorrect filename extraction logic.

DONE.
