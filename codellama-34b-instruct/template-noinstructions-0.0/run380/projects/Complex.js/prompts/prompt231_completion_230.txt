  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is always positive, while `b` can be negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` and `-b` have opposite signs, which would change the result of the `Math.sqrt` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b*b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b*b` is always positive, while `b` can be negative.

DONE.
