  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.push` is a method that adds elements to the end of an array, whereas `args.concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas `args.concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.splice` is a method that adds/removes elements from an array, whereas `args.concat` is a method that creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays.

DONE.
