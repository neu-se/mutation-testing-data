  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(bound)` will create a new promise that resolves with the value of `bound`, but the original code `Q(bound).fapply` will call the `fapply` method on the `bound` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs)` will call the `fapply` method on the `bound` function with the `nodeArgs` array, but the original code `Q(bound).fapply` will not pass any arguments to `fapply`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(deferred)` will create a new promise that resolves with the value of `deferred`, but the original code `Q(bound).fapply` will call the `fapply
