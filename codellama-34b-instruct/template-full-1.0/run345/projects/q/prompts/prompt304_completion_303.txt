  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would cause the loop to only execute when `i` is greater than `len`, which would never happen.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would cause the loop to execute until `i` is less than or equal to `len`, which would execute the loop an additional time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += len
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would cause `i` to be incremented by `len` each time the loop is executed, which would cause the loop to execute an additional `len` times.

DONE.
