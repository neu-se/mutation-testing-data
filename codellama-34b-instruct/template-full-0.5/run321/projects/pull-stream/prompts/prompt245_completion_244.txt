  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function would be called unconditionally, even if `err` is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function would only be called if `err` is truthy, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err && abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function would only be called if `err` is falsy, which is the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
