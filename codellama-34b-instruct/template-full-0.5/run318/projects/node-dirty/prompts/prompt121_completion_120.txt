  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'hello');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument `'hello'`, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument than the original code, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different argument than the original code, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
