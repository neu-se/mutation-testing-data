 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the square root of the sum of `a` and 1, instead of just `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(a, 0.5)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the power function with a base of `a` and an exponent of 0.5, instead of the square root function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the reciprocal of the square root of `a`, instead of just the square root of `a`.

DONE.
