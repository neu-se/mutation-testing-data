  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be invoked with `null` instead of the expected exception, which could cause unexpected side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be invoked with an empty object instead of the expected exception, which could cause unexpected side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be invoked with a function that returns `null` instead of the expected exception, which could cause unexpected side effects.

DONE.
