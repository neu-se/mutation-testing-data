  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with the real part equal to the input value, while this modified code returns a complex number with the real part equal to NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with the real part equal to the input value, while this modified code returns a complex number with the real part equal to Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['ZERO'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns a complex number with the real part equal to the input value, while this modified code returns a complex number with the real part equal to 0.

DONE.
