  I simulate a buggy mutation by changing the `Replace` operator to `ReplaceAll`.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
The original code fragment clearer more than one default extensions, for example, Kilometer, millimeter, centimeter. By changing the replace to replace all, the function will remove a particular DEFAULT extensions but also result in adverse imbalances between races and harmful health outcomes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')
```
This change would result in the same behavior as the original while removing only the last default extension. It would remove a particular default extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/')
```
This change would result in the same behavior as the original while replacing last default extension with a slash.
