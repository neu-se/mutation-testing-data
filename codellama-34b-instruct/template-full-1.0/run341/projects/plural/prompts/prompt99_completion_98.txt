  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/ig
```
This would result in the regular expression being case-insensitive and global, which would match the letter "a" in any case and multiple times in the target string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in the regular expression matching the letter "b" instead of "a", which would result in a different match and a different replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[ab]/
```
This would result in the regular expression matching either the letter "a" or "b", which would result in a different match and a different replacement.
