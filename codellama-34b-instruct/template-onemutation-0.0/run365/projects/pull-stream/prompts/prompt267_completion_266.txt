  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` and the `nextStream` function to be called, even if the `end` value is `false`. This would cause the function to enter an infinite loop, as the `nextStream` function would continue to be called without any way to exit.

DONE.
