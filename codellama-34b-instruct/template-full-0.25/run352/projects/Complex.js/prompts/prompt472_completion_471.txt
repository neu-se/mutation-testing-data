  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isInfinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if a value is infinite, whereas `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number, whereas `isNaN(this['im'])` checks if the imaginary part of the complex number is not a number.

DONE.
