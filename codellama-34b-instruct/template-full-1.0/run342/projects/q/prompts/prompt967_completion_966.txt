  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"new fake argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passed a new fake argument instead of the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be passed the string "hello world" instead of the original arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return "something unexpected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than expected, causing the test results to fail.

DONE.
