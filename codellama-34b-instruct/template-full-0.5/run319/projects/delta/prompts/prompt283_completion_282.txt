  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `indexOf`, and it would not be able to find the same substring in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is a different method than `indexOf`, and it would not be able to find the same substring in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `indexOf`, and it would not be able to find the same substring in the string.

DONE.
