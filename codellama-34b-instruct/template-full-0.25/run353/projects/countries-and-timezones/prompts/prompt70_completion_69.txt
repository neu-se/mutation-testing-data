  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a `null` argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with an `undefined` argument, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function would be called with a different argument than the original code, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
