  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
7
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the substring starting from the 7th character instead of the 8th, which could cause incorrect pluralization of some words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the substring starting from the 9th character instead of the 8th, which could cause incorrect pluralization of some words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the substring starting from the letter "h" instead of the 8th character, which could cause incorrect pluralization of some words.

DONE.
