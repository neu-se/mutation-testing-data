  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err && true` always returns `true` if `err` is truthy, which is not what we want. The original code fragment `err || true` will only return `true` if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `err !== true` checks if `err` is not strictly equal to `true`, which is not what we want. The original code fragment `err || true` will pass if `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false
```
This would result in different behavior because `err === false` checks if `err` is strictly equal to `false`, which is not what we want. The original code fragment `err || true` will pass if `err` is falsy.

DONE.
