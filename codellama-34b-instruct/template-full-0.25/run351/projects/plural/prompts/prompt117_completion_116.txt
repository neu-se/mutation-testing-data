This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be included in the array, which would cause the `addRule` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `length` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
clothes, games, illnesses, misc, function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function() {}` function would be included in the array, which would cause the `addRule` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `length` property of the
