  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return at least 1, even if the `places` parameter is not provided, whereas the original code would return 0 in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the value of `places`, whereas the original code would return the value of `places` if it is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the value of `places`, whereas the original code would not modify the value of `places`.

DONE.
