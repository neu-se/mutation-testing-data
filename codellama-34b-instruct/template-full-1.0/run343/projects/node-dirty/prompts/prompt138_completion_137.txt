  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this._data[key];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the key to retrieve the value from the `_data` object, while the new code fragment is deleting the key from the `_data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the key to retrieve the value from the `_data` object, while the new code fragment is setting the value of the key in the `_data` object to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key]++;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the key to retrieve the value from the `_data` object and is attempting to access the property `val` of the returned object, while the new code fragment is incremeting the value of the key in the `_data` object and is attempting to access the same property `
