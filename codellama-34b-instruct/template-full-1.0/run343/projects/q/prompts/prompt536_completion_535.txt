  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Q.all()` method to wait for all promises to be resolved, while the new code fragment is using the `Q.resolve()` method to instantly resolve the promise with a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Q.all()` method to wait for all promises to be resolved, while the new code fragment is using the `Q.resolve()` method to instantly resolve the promise with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Q.all()` method to wait for all promises to be resolved, while the new code fragment is using the `Q.resolve()` method to instantly resolve the promise with an undefined value.

DONE.
