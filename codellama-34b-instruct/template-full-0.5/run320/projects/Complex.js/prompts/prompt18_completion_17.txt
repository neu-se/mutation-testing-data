  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.abs` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * a` and `Math.abs` have different outputs for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt(a)` and `Math.abs` have different outputs for the same input.

DONE.
