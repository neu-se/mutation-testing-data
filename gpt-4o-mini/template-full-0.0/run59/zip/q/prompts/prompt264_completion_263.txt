Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the provided value instead of being fulfilled, which changes the intended outcome of the `fulfill` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would fulfill the promise with a resolved value of `null`, which may not be the intended value that the caller expects, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in promise consumers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value + " modified")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value being fulfilled by appending " modified" to it, which changes the actual value that the promise resolves to, potentially affecting any subsequent operations that depend on the original value.

DONE.
