  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a number. This change could cause the code to behave differently for certain inputs, depending on the specific behavior of the `Delta.getHandler` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is a function. This change could cause the code to behave differently for certain inputs, depending on the specific behavior of the `Delta.getHandler` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is undefined. This change could cause
