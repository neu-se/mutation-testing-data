  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code fragment only checks if `this` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (z['isInfinite']() && this['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are infinite, while the new code fragment only checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `this` and `z` are
