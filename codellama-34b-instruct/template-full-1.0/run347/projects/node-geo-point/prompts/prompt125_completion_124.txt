  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this.longitude, this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude arguments are swapped, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this.longitude * 2, this.latitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude and latitude values are multiplied by 2, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDistance(this.longitude + 10, this.latitude + 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because 10 is added to the longitude and latitude values, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the distance.

DONE.
