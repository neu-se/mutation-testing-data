  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `noneTask;` The replacement code is `noneTask`, which is a function that does nothing, it will result in different behavior because it will continuously running `noneTask` instead of the intended task, causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `falseTask;` The replacement code is `falseTask`, which is a function that immediately returns `flase`, it will result in different behavior because it will exit the loop early, and may not execute all the tasks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `undefinedTask;` The replacement code is `undefinedTask`, which is a function that immediately returns `undefined`, it will result in different behavior because it will exit the loop early, and may not execute all the tasks in the queue.

DONE.
