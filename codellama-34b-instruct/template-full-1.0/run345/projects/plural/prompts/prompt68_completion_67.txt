  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because "memos" is the correct plural form of "memo", but "memo" is not the correct plural form of "memo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memories'
```
This would result in different behavior because "memories" is not the correct plural form of "memo", but "memos" is the correct plural form of "memo".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'micro'
```
This would result in different behavior because "micro" is not the correct plural form of "memo", but "memos" is the correct plural form of "memo".

DONE.
