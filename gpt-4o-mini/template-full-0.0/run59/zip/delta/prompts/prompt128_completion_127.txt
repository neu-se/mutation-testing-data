Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds the `index` to `start`, potentially causing the `nextOp` to be fetched from an incorrect position in the operations array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies `start` by 2, which would lead to skipping over operations and potentially fetching an out-of-bounds operation or an unintended operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always fetches the first operation regardless of the `start` value, which could lead to incorrect processing of the operations in the slice.

DONE.
