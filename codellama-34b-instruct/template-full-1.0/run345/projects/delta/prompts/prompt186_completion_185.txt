  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object and null is a literal value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp[retain] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp` is an object and `retain` is a variable that has not been declared or initialized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is an object and null is a literal value.

DONE.
