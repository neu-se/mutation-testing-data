  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Number` function to convert the `bearing` variable to a number, but this code fragment multiplies the `bearing` variable by `Math.PI / 180`, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Number` function to convert the `bearing` variable to a number, but this code fragment adds 180 to the `bearing` variable, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Number` function to convert the `bearing` variable to a number, but this code fragment multiplies the `
