  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and `data`, while the new code fragment `cb(data)` calls the `cb` function with only one argument, `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(null, data)` calls the `cb` function with two arguments, `null` and `data`, while the new code fragment `cb(err, null)` calls the `cb` function with two arguments, `err` and `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
