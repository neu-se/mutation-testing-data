 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
`./${globPart}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend `./` to the `globPart`, which might not be desired and could lead to unexpected results when using the `zipArchive.glob()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globPart.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the `globPart`, which might not be desired and could lead to unexpected results when using the `zipArchive.glob()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globPart.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `globPart` to uppercase, which might not match the expected file or directory names and could lead to missing files or directories in the output archive.

DONE.
