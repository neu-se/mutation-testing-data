  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail.get("tail");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return a promise that resolves to the tail of the queue, rather than the head.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = end.tail.get("head");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return a promise that resolves to the head of the queue, rather than the tail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end.tail = Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `get` method to return a rejected promise with the specified error message, rather than a resolved promise with the value of the queue.

DONE.
