  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'goose'`, which is a valid word, but `'goos'` is not a valid word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'goose'`, which is a valid word, but `'goose' + 's'` is not a valid word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'goose'`, which is a valid word, but `'goose' + 'es'` is not a valid word.

DONE.
