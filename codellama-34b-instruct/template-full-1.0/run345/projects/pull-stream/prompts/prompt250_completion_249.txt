  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abortErr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different argument than the original code fragment, which called it with `null` or `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different argument than the original code fragment, which called it with `null` or `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abort` function with a different argument than the original code fragment, which called it with `abort` or `cb`.

DONE.
