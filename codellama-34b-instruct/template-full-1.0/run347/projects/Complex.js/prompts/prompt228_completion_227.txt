  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` is the cube root function, while `Math.sqrt` is the square root function. Using `Math.cbrt` instead of `Math.sqrt` would produce a different result for the same input, and would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` is the absolute value function, while `Math.sqrt` is the square root function. Using `Math.abs` instead of `Math.sqrt` would produce a different result for the same input, and would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the larger of two values, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a value. Using `Math.max` instead of `Math.sqrt
