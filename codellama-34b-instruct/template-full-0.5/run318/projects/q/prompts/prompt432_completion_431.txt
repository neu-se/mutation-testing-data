  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Q.isRejected(object) {

This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return `false`, even if the promise is rejected.

```
Q.isRejected(object) {
    return isPromise(object) && object.inspect().state === "pending";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would always return `false`, even if the promise
