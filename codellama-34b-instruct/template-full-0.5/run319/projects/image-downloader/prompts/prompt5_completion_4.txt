  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject('Error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with no error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error('Error message'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `Promise.reject` returns a rejected promise with no error message.

DONE.
