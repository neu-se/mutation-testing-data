Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for slicing the arguments from the second argument to the first, potentially omitting the first argument and altering the expected behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for slicing the arguments from the second argument to the second, which would include the first argument in the `nodeArgs` array, leading to incorrect argument handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the total number of arguments as the starting index for slicing, which would result in an empty array for `nodeArgs`, causing the function to fail when trying to call the method with no arguments.

DONE.
