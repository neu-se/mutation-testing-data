  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& false` would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if `define['amd']` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& 0` would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if `define['amd']` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof define === 'function' && define['amd'] && null
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional `&& null` would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false`, even if `define['amd']` is `true`.

DONE.
