  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `when` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a function in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a method in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise, but it is not being used as a function in the original code fragment.

DONE.
