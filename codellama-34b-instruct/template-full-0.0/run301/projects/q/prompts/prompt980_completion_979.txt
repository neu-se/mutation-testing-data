  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method is called with `undefined` as an argument, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver()` method is called with `null` as an argument, which may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
