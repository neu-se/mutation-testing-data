  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with two arguments, `null` and `data`. This would cause the test to fail if it is expecting only one argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function with one argument, `ended`. This would cause the test to fail if it is expecting no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with two arguments, `null` and `data`, while this code fragment calls the callback function with three arguments, `null`, `data`, and `ended`. This would cause the test to fail if it is expecting only two arguments
