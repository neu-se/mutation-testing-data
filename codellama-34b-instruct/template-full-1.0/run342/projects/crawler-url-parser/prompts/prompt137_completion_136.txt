  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with a whitespace instead of a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with a "#" instead of a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last occurrence of "/index.[a-z]+$" with a "$" instead of a forward slash.

DONE.
