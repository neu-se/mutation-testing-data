  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.startsWith("http://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this code fragment uses the `startsWith()` method to check if the URL starts with the string "http://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf("http://") === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this code fragment uses the `indexOf()` method to check if the URL starts with the string "http://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.substr(0, 7) === "http://"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to check if the URL starts with a protocol, while this code fragment uses the `substr()` method to check if the first 7 characters of the URL are
