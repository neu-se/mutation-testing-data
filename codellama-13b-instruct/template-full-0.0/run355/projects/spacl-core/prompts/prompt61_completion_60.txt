  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any string that contains at least one character that is not a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/[^/]+/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any string that contains at least one character that is not a forward slash, followed by a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/[^/]+/[^/]+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any string that contains at least one character that is not a forward slash, followed by at least one character that is not a forward slash.

DONE.
