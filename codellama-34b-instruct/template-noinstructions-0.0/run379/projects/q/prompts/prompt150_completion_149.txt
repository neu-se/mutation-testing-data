  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` creates a shallow copy of the `stack` array, which would cause the `stackCounter` property to be different from the original `stack` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `stack` array and an empty array, which would cause the `stackCounter` property to be different from the original `stack` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` creates a shallow copy of the `stack` array starting from the second element, which would cause the `stackCounter` property to be different from the original `stack` array.

DONE.
