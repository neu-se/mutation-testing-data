  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.reverse` is a method that returns the opposite of a URL, whereas `URL.resolve` is a method that resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.normalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.normalize` is a method that normalizes a URL by removing unnecessary components such as trailing slashes, whereas `URL.resolve` is a method that resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` is a method that parses a URL and returns an object containing the URL components, whereas `URL.resolve` is a method that resolves a relative URL to an absolute URL.

DONE.
