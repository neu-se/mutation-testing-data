  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "8s" instead of "8" when the input is 8.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
9
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "9s" instead of "9" when the input is 9.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return the string "10s" instead of "10" when the input is 10.

DONE.
