  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - start)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the iterator to return a different value.

DONE.
