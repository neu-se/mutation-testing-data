  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"buggy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected with the value "buggy" instead of "promise".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected with the value "rejected" instead of "promise".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would now be rejected with the value "error" instead of "promise".

DONE.
