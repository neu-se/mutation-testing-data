  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a character access operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a property access operation.

DONE.
