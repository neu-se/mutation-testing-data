  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as `undefined` is not a valid key in the `PolicyMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as `null` is not a valid key in the `PolicyMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This change will cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, as an empty string is not a valid key in the `PolicyMap`.

DONE.
