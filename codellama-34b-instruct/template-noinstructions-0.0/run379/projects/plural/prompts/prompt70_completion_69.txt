  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cello')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this code fragment would replace an existing rule with the same name, resulting in a different set of rules being applied to the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('cello', 'cellos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the list of rules, but this code fragment would add a new rule with the same name, resulting in a different set of rules being applied to the input word.
