  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2) + 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function would be applied to `λ2` before adding `540`, which would cause the resulting longitude value to be off by `540` degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2) - 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function would be applied to `λ2` before subtracting `540`, which would cause the resulting longitude value to be off by `-540` degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2) * 540
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function would be applied to `λ2` before multiplying by `540`, which would cause the resulting longitude value to be off by a factor of `540`.
