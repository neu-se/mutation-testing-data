  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncork` is called on every iteration of the loop, which is not the case with the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because `cork` is never called in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is called on every iteration of the loop, which is not the case with the original code.

DONE.
