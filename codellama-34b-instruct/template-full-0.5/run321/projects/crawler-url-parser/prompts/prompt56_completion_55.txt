  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different set of properties, including the `search` property, which is used in the code to check for query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different set of properties, including the `pathname` property, which is used in the code to check for the presence of a path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse` method would return a different set of properties, including the `port` property, which is used in the code to check for the presence of a port number.

DONE.
