  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Math.random() * 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random bearing value instead of the actual bearing between two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) + 360) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 360 to the bearing value before taking the modulo 360, which would cause the bearing to be in the range of 0 to 720 instead of 0 to 360.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return (rad2deg(θ) + 180) % 360;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 to the bearing value before taking the modulo 360, which would cause the bearing to be in the range of 180 to 540 instead of 0
