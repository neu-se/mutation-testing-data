  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number, whereas `Math.pow` returns the value of a number raised to a power.

DONE.
