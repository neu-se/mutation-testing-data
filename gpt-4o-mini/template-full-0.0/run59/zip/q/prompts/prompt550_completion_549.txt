Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of resolving the promise with the value, it would reject the promise with that value, leading to a failure in the promise chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would wrap the result value in a new promise instead of returning the value directly, potentially altering the expected flow of the promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the resolved value by adding 1 to it, which could lead to unexpected results in the subsequent promise handling.

DONE.
