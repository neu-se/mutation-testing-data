  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a runtime error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with an undefined value, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
