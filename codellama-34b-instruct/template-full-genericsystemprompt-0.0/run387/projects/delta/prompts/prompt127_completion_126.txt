  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one more time than intended, potentially leading to an infinite loop or an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than intended, potentially leading to a missing iteration or an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index - 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate two fewer times than intended, potentially leading to a missing iteration or an incorrect result.

DONE.
