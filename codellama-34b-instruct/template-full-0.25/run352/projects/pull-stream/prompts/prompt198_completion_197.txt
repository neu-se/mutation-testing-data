  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is called when the `abort` event occurs, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the `read` event occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(aborted)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` error to the `abortCb` callback function, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the `read` event occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb(null, aborted)` is a function call that passes the `aborted` error to the `abortCb` callback function, while `cb` is a callback function that is called when the
