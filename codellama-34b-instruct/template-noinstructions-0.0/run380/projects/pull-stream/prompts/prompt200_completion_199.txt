  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would behave as if `busy` was always `false`, even if it was previously `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `busy`, so the code would behave as if `busy` was always `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `busy`, so the code would behave as if `busy` was always `true`.

DONE.
