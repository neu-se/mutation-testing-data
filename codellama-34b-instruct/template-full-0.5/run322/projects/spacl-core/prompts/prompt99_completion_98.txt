  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called on the `policy` object, which is not the same as the original code fragment `policy.query`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called with only two arguments, `path` and `verb`, instead of three arguments as in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `query` method to be called with an additional argument `1`, which is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
