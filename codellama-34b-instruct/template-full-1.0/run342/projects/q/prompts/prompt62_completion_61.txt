  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called. Instead, the `nextTick` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flush` function would not be called. Instead, the `nextTick` function would be called with `undefined` as the argument, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"flush"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nextTick` function would be called with `"flush"` as the argument, which would result in an error.

DONE.
