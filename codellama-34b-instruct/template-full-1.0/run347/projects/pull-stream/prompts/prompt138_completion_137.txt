  Alright! Let's start with some mutation options for the code snippet you provided.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `}}` would create an extra brace and likely cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null;` would change the return value of the function from `cb` to `null`, which would cause any subsequent code to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined;` would change the return value of the function from `cb` to `undefined`, which would cause any subsequent code to execute differently.

DONE.
