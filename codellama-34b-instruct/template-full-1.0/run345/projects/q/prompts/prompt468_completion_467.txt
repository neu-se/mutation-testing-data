  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because "unhandledRejection" is a distinct event type and does not have the same behavior as "rejectionHandled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "rejected" has a different semantic meaning in the context of Q promises and would not have the same behavior as "rejectionHandled".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "fulfilled" has a different semantic meaning in the context of Q promises and would not have the same behavior as "rejectionHandled".

DONE.
