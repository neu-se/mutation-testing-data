  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is not available in the scope of the anonymous function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is not available in the scope of the anonymous function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is not available in the scope of the anonymous function.

DONE.
