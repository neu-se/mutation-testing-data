Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0 ? 'insert' : 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly assumes that if there is any length available, the next operation is always an 'insert', which could lead to misinterpretation of the operation type and incorrect index calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'retain' ? 'insert' : 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the next operation type to be 'insert' if the current operation is 'retain', which could lead to incorrect handling of 'delete' operations and disrupt the intended transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks the type of the next operation from the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter`, leading to potential mismatches in the transformation logic and incorrect index adjustments.

DONE.
