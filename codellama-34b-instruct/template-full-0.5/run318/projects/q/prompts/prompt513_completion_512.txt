  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would receive `null` as an argument, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of an array of object keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would receive `undefined` as an argument, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of an array of object keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_keys` function would receive an empty object as an argument, which would cause it to return an empty array instead of an array of object keys.

DONE.
