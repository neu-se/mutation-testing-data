  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless, regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` method to always return a promise that is fulfilled with the value `regardless`, regardless of the state of the input promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` method to always return a promise that is fulfilled with the value `promise`, regardless of the state of the input promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `allSettled` method to always return a promise that is fulfilled with the value `null`, regardless of the state of the input promises.

DONE.
