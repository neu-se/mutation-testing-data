  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This change will cause the `peekLength()` method to return a value that is one less than the actual length of the next operation, which could cause the `next()` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This change will cause the `peekLength()` method to return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the next operation, which could cause the `next()` method to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This change will cause the `peekLength()` method to return a value that is twice the actual length of the next operation, which could cause the `next()` method to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
