  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the sine of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the cosine of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the tangent of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the tangent of the real part.

DONE.
