  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is being called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is being called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>) !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method is being called with a different argument, which could potentially return a different result.

DONE.
