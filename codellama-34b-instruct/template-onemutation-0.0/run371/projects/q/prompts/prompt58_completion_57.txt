  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setImmediate !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `setImmediate` is a function, while the modified code fragment checks if it is not a function. This change would cause the code to take the `else` branch, which uses `setTimeout` instead of `setImmediate`.

DONE.
