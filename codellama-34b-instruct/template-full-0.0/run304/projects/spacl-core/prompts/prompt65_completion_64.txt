  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array by spreading the elements of the `rules` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the `rules` array with an empty array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array by spreading the elements of the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map((rule) => rule)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the `rules` array, whereas the original code fragment creates a new array by spreading the elements of the `rules` array.

DONE.
