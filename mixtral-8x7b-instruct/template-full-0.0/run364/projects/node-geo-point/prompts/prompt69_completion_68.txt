 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y, x
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the y component is flipped, which would affect the calculation of the destination point's longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y, -x
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the x component is flipped, which would affect the calculation of the destination point's latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(y), Math.abs(x)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the destination point with positive latitude and longitude values, regardless of the input bearing.

DONE.
