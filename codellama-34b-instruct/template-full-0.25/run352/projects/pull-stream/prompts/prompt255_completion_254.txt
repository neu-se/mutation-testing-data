  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `nextStream` function, while the new code fragment is a call to the `nextStream` function. This would cause the function to be executed immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `nextStream` function, while the new code fragment is a call to the `nextStream` function with two arguments: `null` and an anonymous function. This would cause the function to be executed immediately,
