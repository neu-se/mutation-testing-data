  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, but the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, but the `close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is drained, but the `read_close` event is emitted when the read stream is closed.

DONE.
