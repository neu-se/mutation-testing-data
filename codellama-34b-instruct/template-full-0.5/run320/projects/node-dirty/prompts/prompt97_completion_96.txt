  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = () => {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be overwritten with an empty function, causing any calls to `emit` to have no effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = () => { throw new Error('emit'); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be overwritten with a function that throws an error, causing any calls to `emit` to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit = () => { return 'foo'; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be overwritten with a function that returns the string 'foo', causing any calls to `emit` to return the string 'foo' instead of the expected behavior.

DONE.
