 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.buildCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `buildCountry` property of the `data` object, rather than invoking the `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => buildCountry
