  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduceRight
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduceRight` iterates over the array from right to left, whereas `reduce` iterates from left to right. This could cause the final result to be different, depending on the order of the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` iterates over the array and executes the provided function for each element, but does not return a new array. This could cause the final result to be different, depending on the implementation of the function provided to `forEach`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` iterates over the array and executes the provided function for each element, returning a new array with the results. This could cause the final result to be different, depending on the implementation of the function provided to `map`.

DONE.
