  Sure, here are three possible mutations for the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` and `false` are different values, and the `if` statement that uses the PLACEHOLDER would behave differently depending on which value is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `if` statement that uses the PLACEHOLDER would behave differently depending on whether the value is truthy or falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'hello'` is a string value, and the `if` statement that uses the PLACEHOLDER would behave differently depending on whether the value is a string or not.

DONE.
