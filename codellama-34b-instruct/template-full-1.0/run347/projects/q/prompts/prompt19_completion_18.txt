  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete captureLine
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a keyword in JavaScript that deletes an object property, but `captureLine` is not an object property in this code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `captureLine` is defined as a function in this code snippet, and assigning a value of 0 to it would overwrite the function definition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would trigger the execution of the code in the function body, which could potentially have side effects that alter the behavior of the program.

DONE.
