 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the deprecation warning would always be logged, regardless of whether the `console` object or its `warn` method exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the deprecation warning would always be logged, since the expression `1 < 2` evaluates to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof window !== "undefined" && typeof window.console === "object" && typeof window.console.warn === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the deprecation warning would only be logged if the code is executed in a browser environment, instead of a Node.js environment.

DONE.
