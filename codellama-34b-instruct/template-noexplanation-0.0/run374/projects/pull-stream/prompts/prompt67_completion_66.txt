  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `end` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || end !== true
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `end` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && end !== end
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `end` is not equal to itself, which is always `false`.

DONE.
