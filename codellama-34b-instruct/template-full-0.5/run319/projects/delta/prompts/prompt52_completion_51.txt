  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant is not a valid embed type, and the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would throw an error if it is passed a value of `NULL_CHARACTER` as an embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for the embed type and data if the `a` and `b` parameters are objects with a different embed type than the one passed in the `embedType` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function would return a different value for the embed type and data if the `a` and `b` parameters are objects with a different embed type than the one passed in the `embedType` parameter.
