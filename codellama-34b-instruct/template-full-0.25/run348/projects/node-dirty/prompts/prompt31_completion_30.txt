  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is a different method that takes a function as its second argument, whereas `set` takes a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` is a different method that returns the value associated with a key, whereas `set` sets the value associated with a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rm
```
This would result in different behavior because `rm` is a different method that removes a key and its associated value, whereas `set` sets the value associated with a key.

DONE.
