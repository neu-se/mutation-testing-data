 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise resolved with `null` instead of an empty array for an immediate reference for the target object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise resolved with an empty object instead of an empty array for an immediate reference for the target object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would return a promise resolved with an array containing a single string 'key' instead of an empty array for an immediate reference for the target object.

DONE.
