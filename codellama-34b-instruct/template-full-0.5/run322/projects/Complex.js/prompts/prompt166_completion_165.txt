  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined in the `Complex` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
