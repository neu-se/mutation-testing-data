  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_error
```
This would result in different behavior because `parser_exit` is a function that is called when the parser encounters an error, while `parser_error` is a function that is called when the parser encounters an unexpected token or syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_error("Unexpected token: " + tokens[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error with a custom message, instead of simply returning a `Complex` object with `NaN` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(tokens[i])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parser_exit` function with the current token as an argument, which would then be used to determine the behavior of the parser.

DONE.
