  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` was used to signal the start of a new stream, whereas using `null` would not signal the start of a new stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` was used to signal the start of a new stream, whereas using `undefined` would not signal the start of a new stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stream"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` was used to signal the start of a new stream, whereas using `"stream"` would signal the start of a new stream, but also would result in a different error message.

DONE.
