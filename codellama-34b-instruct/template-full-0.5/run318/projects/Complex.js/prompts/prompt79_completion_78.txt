  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the code would only match the character 'a', instead of any whitespace character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the code would only match the character 'b', instead of any whitespace character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'c'
```
This would result in different behavior because now the code would only match the character 'c', instead of any whitespace character.

DONE.
