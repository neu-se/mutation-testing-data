  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `1` would cause the `matches` method to always return `true`, regardless of the actual path and context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, path
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `path` would cause the `matches` method to always return `true`, regardless of the actual path and context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional argument `ctx.path` would cause the `matches` method to always return `true`, regardless of the actual path and context.

DONE.
