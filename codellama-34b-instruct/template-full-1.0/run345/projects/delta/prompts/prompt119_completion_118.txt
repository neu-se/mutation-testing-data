  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` whenever `lastOp.retain` is a number, regardless of whether it has the `attributes` property or not, rather than only when it is an object with an `attributes` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && lastOp.attributes !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` whenever `lastOp.retain` is a number and `lastOp.attributes` is not `null`, regardless of whether it is an object or not, rather than only when it is an object with an `attributes` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp.retain === 'object' && lastOp.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to `true` whenever
