  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.foo` is undefined, while `object` is a valid object reference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, while `object` is an object reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, while `object` is an object reference.

DONE.
