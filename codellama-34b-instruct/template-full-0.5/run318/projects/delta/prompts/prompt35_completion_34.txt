  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` checks if `b` is null, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object. If `b` is null, the first condition would be true, but the second condition would be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `!b instanceof Object` checks if `b` is not an instance of the `Object` class, while `typeof b !== 'object'` checks if `b` is not an object. If `b` is an instance of a subclass of `Object`, the first condition would be false, but the second condition would be true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b?.constructor?.name !== 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `b?.constructor?.name !== 'Object'` checks if the name of the constructor of `b` is not
