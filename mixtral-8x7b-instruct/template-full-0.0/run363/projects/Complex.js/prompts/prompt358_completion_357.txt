 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the value of `a`, which is the real part of the complex number, before passing it to the `cosh` function. This could cause the function to produce incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would apply the `cos` function to the real part of the complex number `a` instead of passing it directly to the `cosh` function. This could cause the function to produce incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the real part of the complex number before passing it to the `cosh` function. This could cause the function to produce incorrect results for certain input values.

DONE.
