  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions || zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `true` if `zipAFolderOptions` is truthy, regardless of the value of `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would always return `false` if `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream` is falsy, regardless of the value of `zipAFolderOptions`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions ? zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator would always return `null` if `zipAFolderOptions` is falsy, regardless of the value of `zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream`.

DONE.
