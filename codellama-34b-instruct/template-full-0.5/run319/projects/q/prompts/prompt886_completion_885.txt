  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a new array with the same elements as the original, but in reverse order. Using `array_slice.reverse()` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be reversed, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the `Q.nfapply` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method returns a new array with the specified range of elements from the original array. Using `array_slice(args, 0, 1)` would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be truncated to only the first element, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior in the `Q.nfapply` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(args, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior
