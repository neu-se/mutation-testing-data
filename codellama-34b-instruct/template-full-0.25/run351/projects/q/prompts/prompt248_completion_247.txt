  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` would return the length of the stack trace, which would likely be different than the index of the first newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the index of the first newline character and then subtract 1, which would result in a different substring of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the index of the first newline character and then add 2, which would result in a different substring of the stack trace.

DONE.
