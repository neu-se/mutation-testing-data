  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `lastOp.delete` is `0`, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `lastOp.delete` is `0`, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.delete < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `lastOp.delete` is negative, regardless of the value of `newOp.insert`.

DONE.
