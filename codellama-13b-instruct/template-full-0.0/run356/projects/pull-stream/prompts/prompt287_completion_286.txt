  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is applied to the `data` variable, which is a number, and the `+` operator is used to add 1 to it. This would cause the `mapper` function to return a different value than the original code, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is applied to the `data` variable, which is a number, and the `-` operator is used to subtract 1 from it. This would cause the `mapper` function to return a different value than the original code, which would result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mapper` function is applied to the `data` variable, which is a number, and the `*` operator is used to
