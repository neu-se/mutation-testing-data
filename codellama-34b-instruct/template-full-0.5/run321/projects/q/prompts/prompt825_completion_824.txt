  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, function (reason) {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the reason for rejection to the `finally` callback, while the modified code fragment would throw the reason as an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
}, function (reason) {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would pass the reason for rejection to the `finally` callback, while the modified code fragment would return the reason as a fulfilled value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
}, function (reason) {
    throw reason;
});
