  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not being called, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be empty, and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is being called with `null` as the `this` value, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is being called with a different function as the `this` value, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected with a different value.

DONE.
