  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.attributes` is an object, and `lastOp.attributes.length` would return the number of keys in the object, which may not be the same as the number of attributes in the `lastOp` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.attributes` is an object, and `lastOp.attributes[0]` would return the first key in the object, which may not be the same as the first attribute in the `lastOp` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp.attributes` is an object, and `lastOp.attributes.slice(1)` would return a new object with all the keys except the first one, which may not be the same as the attributes in
