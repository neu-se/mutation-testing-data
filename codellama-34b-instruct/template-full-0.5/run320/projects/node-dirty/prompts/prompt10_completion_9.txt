  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `path` property is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the `this._data` map has any elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `path` property is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the `this._data` map has no elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `path` property is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if the `this._data` map has no elements.

DONE.
