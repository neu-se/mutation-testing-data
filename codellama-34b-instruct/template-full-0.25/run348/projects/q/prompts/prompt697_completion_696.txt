  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function, starting from the second argument, whereas `arguments` would return an array-like object containing all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 0)` would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function, starting from the first argument, whereas `arguments` would return an array-like object containing all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would return an array of all the arguments passed to the function, starting from the third argument, whereas `arguments` would return an
