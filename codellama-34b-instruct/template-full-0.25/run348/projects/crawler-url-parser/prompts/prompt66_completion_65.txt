  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("=")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on the first occurrence of "=", while this new code fragment splits the search string on every occurrence of "=". This could cause the code to produce different results if the search string contains multiple "=" characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("&")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on the first occurrence of "&", while this new code fragment splits the search string on every occurrence of "&". This could cause the code to produce different results if the search string contains multiple "&" characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split("?")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the search string on the first occurrence of "?", while this new code fragment splits the
