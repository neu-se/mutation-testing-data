  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_close` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the original code fragment emits the `read_close` event when the read stream is closed. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the `read_close` event being emitted in a specific way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event is emitted when an error occurs, whereas the original code fragment emits the `read_close` event when the read stream is closed. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the `read_close` event being emitted in a specific way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted when the write stream is ready to accept more data, whereas the original code fragment
