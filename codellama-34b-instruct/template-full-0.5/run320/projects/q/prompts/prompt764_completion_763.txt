```
when(promise, onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` callback would not be called for the `promise` when it is resolved.

    deferred.resolve(result);
}, function (err) {
    deferred.reject(err);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` and `deferred.re
