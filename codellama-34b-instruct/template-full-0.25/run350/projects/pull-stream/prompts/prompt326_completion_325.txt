  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only calls `once` with the `end` argument, while this modified code calls it with both `end` and `data` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `once` with the `end` argument, while this modified code calls it with the `data` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `once` with the `end` argument, while this modified code calls it with both `end` and `null` arguments.

DONE.
