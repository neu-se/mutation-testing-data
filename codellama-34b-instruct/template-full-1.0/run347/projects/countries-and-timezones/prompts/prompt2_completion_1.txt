  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesMap(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function takes a `data` argument, but the original code fragment did not. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to attempt to access properties of the `data` object that do not exist, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function returns a mapping of timezone IDs to arrays of country IDs, but the original code fragment accessed a property `timezones` on the `data` object directly. This would cause the `buildCountry` function to access the wrong properties and return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.timezones)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function returns a mapping of timezone IDs to arrays of country IDs
