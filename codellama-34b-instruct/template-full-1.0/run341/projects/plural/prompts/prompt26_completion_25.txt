  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule would always return the original string unchanged, as opposed to the original rule which returned a modified string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule would calculate the length of the string and subtract 3, resulting in a negative number, which would cause an error when trying to accessing the substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule would always return the original string unchanged, as opposed to the original rule which returned a modified string.

DONE.
