Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the resolver to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array instead of the end, which could lead to incorrect argument ordering when the callback is invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value instead of the resolver, which would cause the callback to receive `null` as the last argument instead of the expected resolver function, potentially leading to errors in the callback execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `reject` function instead of the resolver, which would mean that the callback would not be able to resolve successfully, and instead, it would immediately reject the promise with the `reject` function.

DONE.
