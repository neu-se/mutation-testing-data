  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink` is a function that takes a single argument, but `source` is a function that takes two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink` is a function that takes a single argument, but `acc` is a variable that contains the accumulated value of the reduction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink` is a function that takes a single argument, but `data` is a variable that contains the current value of the reduction.

DONE.
