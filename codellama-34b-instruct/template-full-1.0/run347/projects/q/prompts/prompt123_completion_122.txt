  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
var key in Array.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the properties of the `Array.prototype` object instead of the `object` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
var index = 0; index < object.length; index++
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through the indices of the `object` variable instead of its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
object.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `key` property is present in the `object` variable instead of looping through its properties.

DONE.
