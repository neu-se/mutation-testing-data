  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `writeFileSync` method on the `fs` module directly, rather than using the `universalify.fromCallback` method to wrap the `writeFileSync` method in a promise. This could cause the `writeFileSync` method to be called with the wrong arguments or in the wrong context, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options.encoding)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the third argument to the `writeFileSync` method, rather than the `options` object itself. This could cause the `writeFileSync` method to interpret the data being written to the file incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFileSync(file, str, options
