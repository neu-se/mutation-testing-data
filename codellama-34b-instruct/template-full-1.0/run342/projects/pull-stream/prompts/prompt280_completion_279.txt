  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `mapper` function, causing the code to always return `null` instead of the expected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operation would add one to the result of the `mapper` function, causing the code to always return one more than the expected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the value of `this` inside the `mapper` function to `null`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
