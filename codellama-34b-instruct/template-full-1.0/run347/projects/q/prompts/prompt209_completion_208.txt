  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now a no-op function, instead of a function that actually calls the `apply` method on the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now a function that returns 0, instead of a function that calls the `apply` method on the `resolvedPromise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test mutation")
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback is now a function that throws an error, instead of a function that calls the `apply` method on the `resolvedPromise` object.

DONE.
