  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passed two arguments to `stringify`, but the modified code fragment passes three arguments. This could cause `stringify` to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different JSON string being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options, obj, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `obj` argument as the second argument to `stringify`, but the modified code fragment passes it as the first argument. This could cause `stringify` to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different JSON string being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed `options` as the third argument to `stringify`, but the modified code fragment passes it as the second argument. This could cause `stringify` to behave differently, potentially resulting in a different JSON string being generated.

DONE.
