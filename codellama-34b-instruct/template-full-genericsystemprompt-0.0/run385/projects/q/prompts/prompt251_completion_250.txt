  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && !hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the `promise.stack` property to be set only when `Q.longStackSupport` is truthy and `hasStacks` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q.longStackSupport || hasStacks
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `promise.stack` property only when `Q.longStackSupport` is falsy or `hasStacks` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && hasStacks && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the `promise.stack` property to `false`, regardless of the values of `Q.longStackSupport` and `hasStacks`.

DONE.
