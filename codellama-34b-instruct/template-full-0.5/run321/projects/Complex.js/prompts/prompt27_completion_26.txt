  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Parameter'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, but the code would still throw a SyntaxError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Argument'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, but the code would still throw a SyntaxError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Input'
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, but the code would still throw a SyntaxError.

DONE.
