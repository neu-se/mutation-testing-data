  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft()` method would not be called, and the resulting `request` variable would always be `http`, regardless of the input URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft()` method would not be called, and the resulting `request` variable would always be `https`, regardless of the input URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft()` method would not be called, and the resulting `request` variable would always be `http`, regardless of the input URL.

DONE.
