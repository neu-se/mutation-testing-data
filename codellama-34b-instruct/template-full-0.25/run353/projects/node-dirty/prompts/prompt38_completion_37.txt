  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const [key, val] of this._data.entries()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator of key-value pairs, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the `Map` object directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const key in this._data) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `for...in` loops over the properties of an object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the values of a `Map` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const val of this._data.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator of the values in the `Map` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs.

DONE.
