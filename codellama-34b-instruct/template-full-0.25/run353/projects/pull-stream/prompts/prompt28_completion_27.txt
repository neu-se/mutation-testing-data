  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be using the second argument instead of the first, which could cause unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be adding 1 to the first argument, which could cause unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be multiplying the first argument by 2, which could cause unexpected results if the function is not designed to handle this case.

DONE.
