Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch(fulfilled, rejected, progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method from `then` to `catch`, which is intended for handling rejections only, potentially causing unhandled promise rejections for fulfilled cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally(fulfilled, rejected, progress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `finally` method, which does not handle fulfillment or rejection but rather executes a callback regardless of the promise's outcome, leading to unexpected results in promise chaining.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(fulfilled, function() { return null; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the rejection handler to always return `null`, effectively ignoring the rejection reason and potentially masking errors that should be handled.

DONE.
