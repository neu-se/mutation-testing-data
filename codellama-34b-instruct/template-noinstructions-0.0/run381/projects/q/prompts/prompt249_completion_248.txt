  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` would return the length of the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.indexOf` would return the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.slice(1)` would return a new string that is a slice of the original stack trace, starting from the second character, whereas `e.stack.indexOf` would return the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace("Error", "Exception")
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.replace("Error", "Exception")` would return a new string that is a copy of the original stack trace, with all occurrences of the word "Error" replaced with "Exception
