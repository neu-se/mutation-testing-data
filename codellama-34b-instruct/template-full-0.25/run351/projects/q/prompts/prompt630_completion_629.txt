  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `delete` operation, which would delete the property with the given key from the object, rather than returning the property value as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `set` operation, which would set the property with the given key to the given value on the object, rather than returning the property value as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `get` operation, which would return the property value for the given key on the object, rather than deleting the property as in the original code.
