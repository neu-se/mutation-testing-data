  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the double of the argument `a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the double of `a` minus 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the double of the argument `a`, while the replaced code fragment calculates the sum of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the double of the argument `a`, while the replaced code fragment compares `a` to `b` for equality.

DONE.
