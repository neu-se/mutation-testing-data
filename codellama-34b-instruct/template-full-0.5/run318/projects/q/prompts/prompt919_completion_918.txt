  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeNodeRejector` is a different function than `makeNodeResolver`, and it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the string "foo" as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver`, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the number 42 as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver`, which would cause it to behave differently than the original code.

DONE.
