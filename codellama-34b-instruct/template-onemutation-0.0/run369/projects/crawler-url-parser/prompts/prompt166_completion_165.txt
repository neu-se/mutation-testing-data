  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference in the number of parts is equal to -1, which means that the link URL has one more part than the page URL. However, if we replace it with `part_count_diff == 1`, it would check if the difference in the number of parts is equal to 1, which means that the page URL has one more part than the link URL. This would result in the opposite behavior, where the link would be considered as an "uplevel" link instead of a "sublevel" link.

DONE.
