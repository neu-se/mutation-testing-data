  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to access the `nearer` property on the `Promise` object, which does not exist. This would cause a `ReferenceError` and the promise would never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(Promise.reject(error))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with another promise that is rejected with the `error` value. This would cause the `notify` method to be called with an `undefined` value, which would then propagate an unhandled rejection error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would try to call the `isPromise` function with the `error` value as an argument, which would cause a `TypeError` because `error` is not a function. This would cause the promise to never
