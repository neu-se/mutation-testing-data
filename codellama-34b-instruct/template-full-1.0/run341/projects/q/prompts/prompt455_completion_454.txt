  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the negation operator `!` to check if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a falsy value, while this code fragment uses the strict equality operator `===` to check if `trackUnhandledRejections` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a truthy value, while this code fragment checks if `array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise)` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isFulfilled()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `trackUnhandledRejections` is a truthy value, while this code fragment checks if
