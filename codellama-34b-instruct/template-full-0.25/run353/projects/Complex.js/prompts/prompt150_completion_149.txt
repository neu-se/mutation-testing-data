  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks for Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks for finite numbers, while `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks for zero, while `isInfinite` checks for Infinity.

DONE.
