Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.slice` method directly on the `arguments` object, which may not handle the `arguments` object correctly in all contexts, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object does not have a `slice` method, which would lead to a runtime error when trying to call `slice` on it, breaking the functionality of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index from `1` to `0`, which would include the first argument in the resulting array instead of excluding it, altering the intended behavior of the function.

DONE.
