  OPTION 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleuses|syllabi|focuss|funguss|cactuss/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because `nucleus`, `syllabus`, `focus`, `fungus`, and `cactus` are all irregular plural words that do not follow the standard -is/-es pluralization rule. The code fragment you suggested adds an extra "s" to the end of each word, while the original code fragment removes the final "is" and replaces it with "i".

DONE.
