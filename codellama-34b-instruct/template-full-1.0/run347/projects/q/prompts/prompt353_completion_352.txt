  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<Rejected>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to reject the promise with the string "<Rejected>" instead of the original exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<Fulfilled>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to resolve the promise with the string "<Fulfilled>" instead of the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `then` method to reject the promise with the original exception, but also cause the `reject` method to be called with the exception as its argument.

DONE.
