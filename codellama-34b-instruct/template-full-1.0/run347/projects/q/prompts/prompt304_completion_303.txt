  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never be entered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would have one iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i != len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would have only one iteration if i is not equal to len and no iterations if i is equal to len.

DONE.
