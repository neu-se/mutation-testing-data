  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word, while this new code fragment removes only the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word and then adds 'es', while this new code fragment removes only the last two characters of the word and then adds 'is'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `substr` to remove the last two characters of the word
