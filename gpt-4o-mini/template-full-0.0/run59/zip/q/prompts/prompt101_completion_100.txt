Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis + this[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from a callback function to a simple addition, which would not apply the intended transformation to each element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies each element by 2 instead of applying the callback function, which could lead to incorrect results depending on the intended operation of the reduce function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from each element instead of applying the callback function, which would not accumulate values correctly and could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
