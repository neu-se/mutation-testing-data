  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.length - 1` would return the number of arguments passed to the function, minus 1, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array containing all arguments passed to the function, except for the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[0]` would return the first argument passed to the function, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would return an array containing all arguments passed to the function, except for the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be a valid value for the code fragment, whereas `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would throw an error if `arguments` is not an array.

DONE.
