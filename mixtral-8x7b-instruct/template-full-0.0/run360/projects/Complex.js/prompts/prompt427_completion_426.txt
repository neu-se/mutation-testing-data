 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value used to calculate the significant digits for the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the square of the magnitude of the complex number would be incorrect, potentially causing incorrect results in methods such as `equals` and `clone`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation of the absolute value of the real part of the complex number would be incorrect, potentially causing incorrect results in methods such as `equals` and `clone`.

DONE.
