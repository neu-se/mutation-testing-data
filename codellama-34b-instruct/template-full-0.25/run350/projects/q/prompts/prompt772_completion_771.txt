  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original array of promises, rather than the array of states as expected by the `allResolved` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.map(function(promise) {
    return promise.inspect();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of promises, rather than an array of states as expected by the `allResolved` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promises.map(function(promise) {
    return promise.inspect().state;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of states, but the states would be the result of calling `inspect` on the promises, rather than the original promises themselves.

DONE.
