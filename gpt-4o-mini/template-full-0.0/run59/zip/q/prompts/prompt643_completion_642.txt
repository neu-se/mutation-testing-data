Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument instead of `args` would cause the method to be invoked without any arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors if the method requires arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invoke", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the operation from "post" to "invoke" alters the intended method being called on the object, which may not exist or behave differently, leading to incorrect results or runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because swapping the order of `args` and `name` in the array would change the parameters being passed to the method, which could lead to incorrect method invocation and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
