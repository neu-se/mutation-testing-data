  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind("next", callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that always uses the first argument (`"next"`) as the value for `verb`. This means that the `continuer` function will always be called with `"next"` as its first argument, regardless of the actual value of `verb` at the time the function is called. This could cause the `continuer` function to behave incorrectly or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind("throw", callback, Q.return)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method returns a new function that always uses the first argument (`"throw"`) as the value for `verb`. This means that the `continuer` function will always be called with `"throw"` as its first argument, regardless of the actual value of `verb` at the time the function is called. This could cause the `continuer` function to behave
