  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of the path, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(src).dir
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse(src).dir` returns the directory name of the source file, while `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the target file.

DONE.
