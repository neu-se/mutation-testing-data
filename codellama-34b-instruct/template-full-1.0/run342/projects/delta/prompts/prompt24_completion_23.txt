  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `b[key]`, which would change the outcome of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value of `a[key]` instead of `b[key]`, which could provide different information about the equality of the two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the value of `b[key]` by 2, which could change the outcome of the comparison.

DONE.
