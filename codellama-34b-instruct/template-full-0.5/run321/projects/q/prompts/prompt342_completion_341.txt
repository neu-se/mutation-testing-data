  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the result of `_fulfilled(value)`, which could be different from `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would be called with the result of `_rejected(exception)`, which could be different from `exception`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(_rejected(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would be called with the result of `_rejected(exception)`, which could be different from `exception`.

DONE.
