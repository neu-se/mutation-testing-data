Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Math.floor` instead of `Math.ceil` would change the way the `r` variable is calculated, potentially affecting the sorting and selection of quantiles in the `multiQuantileSelect` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of using `Math.ceil` to round up the `indices[r]` value, it would directly use the value at the `r` index of the `indices` array, which could be a different value and affect the sorting and selection of quantiles.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the `l` variable, instead of using the `indices[r]` value, which could lead to incorrect sorting and selection of quantiles in the `multiQuantileSelect` function.

DONE.
