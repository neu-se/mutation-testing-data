  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.inspect` returns the inspect object for the promise, while `value.value` returns the fulfillment value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.inspect.toString()` returns the string representation of the inspect object, while `value.value.toString()` returns the string representation of the fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.inspect` checks if the promise is fulfilled, while `value.isFulfilled` checks if the promise is fulfilled and returns a boolean value.

DONE.
