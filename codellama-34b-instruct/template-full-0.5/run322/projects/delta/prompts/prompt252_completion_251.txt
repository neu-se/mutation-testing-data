  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last operation in the iteration, potentially causing the diffing algorithm to miss important differences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra operation in the iteration, potentially causing the diffing algorithm to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(opLength * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include twice as many operations in the iteration, potentially causing the diffing algorithm to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
