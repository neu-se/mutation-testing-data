  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is changed, and the `emit` method will trigger the `'warn'` event instead of the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error' + '!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with a string, which will result in a different event name being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with a number, which will result in a different event name being emitted.

DONE.
