  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `Q.nsend` would be rejected instead of resolved, causing any chained methods to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `Q.nsend` would be resolved with `undefined` instead of the expected value, causing any chained methods to be called with the wrong argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `Q.nsend` would be rejected with the thrown error, causing any chained methods to be skipped.

DONE.
