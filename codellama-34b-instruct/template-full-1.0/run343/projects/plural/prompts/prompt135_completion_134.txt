  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method is applied to the word, which would change its case and potentially result in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.split(' ').reverse().join(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods are applied to the word, which would change its order and potentially result in a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is used instead of the ` word` variable, which would return a different result if the word has only one letter.

DONE.
