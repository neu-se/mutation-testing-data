  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head
```
This would result in different behavior because `head` is a global variable, but the original code used `task`, which is only defined within the scope of the `runSingle` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
import path
```
This would result in different behavior because `import` is a Python keyword, but the original code used a valid JavaScript identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head
```
This would result in different behavior because `head` is a global variable, but the original code used `task`, which is only defined within the scope of the `runSingle` function.

DONE.
