  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `_has_illegal_chars` is being called with the wrong argument. In the original code, the function is called with `baseUrlStr` as an argument, but in the mutated code, it is called with `currentUrlStr` as an argument. This could cause the function to return a different value, which could in turn affect the behavior of the program.

DONE.
