  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._flush()` method is not defined in the provided code snippet, and therefore the code would throw a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._flush()` method is defined to take no arguments, and passing `false` as an argument would cause a type mismatch error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `this._flush()` method is defined to take no arguments, and passing `true` as an argument would cause a type mismatch error.

DONE.
