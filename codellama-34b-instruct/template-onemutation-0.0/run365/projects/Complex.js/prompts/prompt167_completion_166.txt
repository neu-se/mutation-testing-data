  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if the complex number is infinite, while the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is zero. Using `isInfinite` instead of `isZero` would cause the `div` method to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when the divisor is zero, which is incorrect.

DONE.
