  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.contains(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `contains` is a method that checks if a string contains a specified value, whereas `includes` is a method that checks if a string contains a specified value, and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the string contains the specified value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` is a method that checks if a string starts with a specified value, whereas `includes` is a method that checks if a string contains a specified value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.indexOf(pageurl_path) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` is a method that returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string, whereas `includes` is a method that checks if a string contains a specified
