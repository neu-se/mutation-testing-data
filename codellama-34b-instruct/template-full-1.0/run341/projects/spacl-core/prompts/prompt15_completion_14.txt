  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0' ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/ : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|*|\+\+))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern used in the `match` method is different than the original, it will match a wider range of inputs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0' ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/ : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|*|\+\**))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern used in the `match` method is different than the original, it will match a wider range of inputs and also allow for additional characters such as `**` to be matched.
