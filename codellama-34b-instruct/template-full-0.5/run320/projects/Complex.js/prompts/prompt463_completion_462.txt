  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict inequality operator (`<`) to check if the absolute value of `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while the modified code fragment uses the non-strict inequality operator (`<=`) to check if the absolute value of `b` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`. This change in the comparison operator could cause the `toString` method to return a different string representation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict inequality operator (`<`) to check if the absolute value of `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, while the modified code fragment uses the strict inequality operator (`>`) to check if the absolute value of `b` is greater than `
