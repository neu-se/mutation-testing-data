  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an abortion error object, but with `null` the code would assume there is no error and continue executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an abortion error object, but with `true` the code would assume there is an abortion error and exit early.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an abortion error object, but with `undefined` the code would assume there is no error and continue executing.

DONE.
