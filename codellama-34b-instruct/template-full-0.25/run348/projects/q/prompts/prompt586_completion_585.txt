  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().then(function () { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `then` method to the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the error to be thrown when the promise is resolved, rather than when it is created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().catch(function () { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `catch` method to the promise returned by `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which would cause the error to be thrown when the promise is rejected, rather than when it is created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().then(function () { return Q.reject("Test error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `then` method to the promise returned by `Q
