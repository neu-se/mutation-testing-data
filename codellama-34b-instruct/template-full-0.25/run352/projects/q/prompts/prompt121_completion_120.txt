  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the first element of the object, as the `key` variable would be initialized to 0 and never updated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Object.keys(object).length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate over the last element of the object, as the `key` variable would be initialized to the length of the object and never updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.floor(Math.random() * Object.keys(object).length);
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over a random element of the object each time, as the `key` variable would be initialized to a random integer between 0 and the length of the object.

DONE.
