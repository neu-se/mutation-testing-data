  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `id` argument, which would return a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` argument, which would return a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(timezones[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `timezones[id]` argument, which would return a different timezone object than the original code fragment.

DONE.
