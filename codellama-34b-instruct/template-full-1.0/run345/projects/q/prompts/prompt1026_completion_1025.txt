  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is null or undefined, causing a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is not a promise, causing a TypeError when trying to call the `.nodeify()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Test error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is an Error object, causing the callback to be called with the error rather than the expected value.

DONE.
