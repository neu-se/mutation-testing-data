 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => data[field]
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes `field` is a string and tries to access it as a property of the `data` object, whereas the original `prop` function correctly handles both string and function inputs for `field`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => field
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the `field` function itself instead of calling it and returning the result, which is the intended behavior of the original `prop` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data => field(data) || true
