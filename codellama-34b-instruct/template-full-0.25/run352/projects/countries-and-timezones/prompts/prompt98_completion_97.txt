  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `!==` operator would cause the function to return the timezone object even if the `deprecated` property is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `deprecated` property, causing the function to return the timezone object even if the `deprecated` property is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated == false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for loose equality, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `==` operator would cause the function to return the timezone object even if the `deprecated` property is
