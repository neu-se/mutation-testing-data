  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.push('dice')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new element to the `misc` array, whereas the original code simply appends the string "dice" to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc = ['dice']
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the entire `misc` array with a new array containing only the string "dice", whereas the original code appends the string "dice" to the end of the `misc` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
misc.concat(['dice'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array containing the elements of the `misc` array and the string "dice", whereas the original code simply appends the string "dice" to the end of the `misc` array.

DONE.
