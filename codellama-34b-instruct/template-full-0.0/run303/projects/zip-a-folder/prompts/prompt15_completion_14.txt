  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `W_OK` constant checks for write permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for read permission.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `X_OK` constant checks for execute permission, whereas the original code fragment checks for read permission.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `F_OK` constant checks for the existence of the file, whereas the original code fragment checks for read permission.

DONE.
