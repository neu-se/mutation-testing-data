  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to be called with the `source` function as an argument, which is not the intended behavior. The `source` function is a callback that is called with the `acc` and `data` arguments, but it is not intended to be called with the `sink` function as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to be called with the `acc` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The `acc` argument is a callback that is called with the `data` argument, but it is not intended to be called with the `sink` function as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sink` function to be called with
