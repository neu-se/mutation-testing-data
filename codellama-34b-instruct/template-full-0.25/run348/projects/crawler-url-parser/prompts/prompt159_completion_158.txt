  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last slash from the URL, which could change the interpretation of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last slash with a period, which could change the interpretation of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"#"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the last slash with a hash symbol, which could change the interpretation of the URL.

DONE.
