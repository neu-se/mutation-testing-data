  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain !== 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` are numbers, while this new code fragment checks if they are not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain !== 'number' ||
          typeof lastOp.retain !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.retain` and `lastOp.retain` are numbers, while this new code fragment checks if either of them is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.retain !== 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.retain === 'number'
```
