Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the source of the base URL from the intended `sourceUrl` to `baseUrlStr`, which may not be defined or valid at this point, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `currentUrlStr` instead of `sourceUrl`, which is meant to represent the URL being processed. This could lead to incorrect URL extraction and parsing, as `currentUrlStr` may not be the intended input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing it with `null` would cause the `parse` function to receive a `null` value instead of a valid URL string, leading to a return value of `null` for `baseUrl`, which would affect subsequent URL processing.

DONE.
