  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dummy'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'dummy' event instead of the 'drain' event, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'error' event instead of the 'drain' event, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the 'close' event instead of the 'drain' event, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
