  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is removed, which means the regex will no longer match words that end in "quy" regardless of case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which means the regex will match all occurrences of "quy" in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which means the regex will match words that end in "quy" regardless of case.

DONE.
