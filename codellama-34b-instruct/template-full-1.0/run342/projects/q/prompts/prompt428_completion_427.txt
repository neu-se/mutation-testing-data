  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === 'rejected'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only the `rejected` state instead of all three states.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only the `rejected` property instead of the `state` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only the `fulfilled` property instead of the other two properties.

DONE.
