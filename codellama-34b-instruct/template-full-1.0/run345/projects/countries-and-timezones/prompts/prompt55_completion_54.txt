  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `options` object to retrieve the `deprecated` property, but `undefined` does not have any properties, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `options` object to retrieve the `deprecated` property, but an empty object `{}` does not have any properties, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{deprecated: true}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `options` object to retrieve the `deprecated` property, but a new object `{deprecated: true}` would always have the `deprecated` property set to `true`, regardless of the value of the `options` object.

DONE.
