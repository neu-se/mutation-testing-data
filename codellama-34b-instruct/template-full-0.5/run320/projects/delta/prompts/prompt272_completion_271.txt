  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether there are more ops in the iterator, while `iter.hasNext` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether there are more ops in the other iterator, while `iter.hasNext` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` is a method that returns the next op in the iterator, while `iter.hasNext` is a variable that is not defined in the code snippet.

DONE.
