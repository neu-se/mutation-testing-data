  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the "g" flag, which causes the regular expression to be tested against all possible matches in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/i.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the "i" flag, which causes the regular expression to be case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/g.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to include the "g" flag, which causes the regular expression to be tested against all possible matches in the string, rather than just the first one.

DONE.
