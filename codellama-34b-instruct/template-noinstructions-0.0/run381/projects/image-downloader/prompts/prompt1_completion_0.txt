  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is `undefined`. If `options.url` is `null` or an empty string, the original code would still consider it valid, while the new code would reject it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if its length is 0. If `options.url` is an empty string, the original code would still consider it valid, while the new code would reject it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url.indexOf('http') !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options.url` is falsy, while this new code
