  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be returned, but `null` is not a promise and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be returned, but `undefined` is not a promise and would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise to be returned, but `Q.reject(new Error("error"))` is a rejected promise and would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
