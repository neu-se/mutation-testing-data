 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` condition would always be treated as false, and the `cb` function would be called regardless of whether the stream should be aborted or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` condition would always be treated as null, and the `cb` function would be called regardless of whether the stream should be aborted or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_read` function would be called with the wrong arguments (`_read` instead of `abort`), which could cause unexpected behavior or errors in the `_read` function.

DONE.
