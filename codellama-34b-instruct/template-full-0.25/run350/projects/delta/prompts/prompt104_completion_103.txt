  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the predicate function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, potentially leading to a runtime error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the predicate function to be called with only one argument, which may not be what the function is expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the predicate function to be called with the wrong index value, potentially leading to incorrect filtering of the ops array.

DONE.
