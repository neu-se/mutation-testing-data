  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero()` would return `true` if `z` is zero, whereas `isInfinite()` would return `true` if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['modulus']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `modulus()` returns the magnitude of a complex number, whereas `isInfinite()` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['phase']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `phase()` returns the angle of a complex number, whereas `isInfinite()` checks if the number is infinite.

DONE.
