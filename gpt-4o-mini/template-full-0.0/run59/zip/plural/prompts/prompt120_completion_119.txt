Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pluralize words that are already in their plural form, appending 's' to them instead of returning them unchanged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the word instead of the word itself, which is not the intended functionality of the pluralization logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the word to uppercase instead of returning it in its original form, altering the expected output of the pluralization function.

DONE.
