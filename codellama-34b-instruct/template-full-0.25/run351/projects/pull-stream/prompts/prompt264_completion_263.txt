  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of `null` when the `data` argument is not provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `undefined`, and it would cause the function to return `null` instead of `undefined` when the `data` argument is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is not the same as `null` or `undefined`, and it would cause the function to return an empty string instead of `null` or `undefined` when the `data` argument is not provided.

DONE.
