  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay(0)` returns a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay(1)` returns a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.delay(2)` returns a promise that is resolved with `undefined`, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the object.

DONE.
