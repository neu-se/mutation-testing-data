  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with an incorrect parameter, causing the update to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with an incorrect parameter, causing the update to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the updater function would be called with an incorrect parameter, causing the update to fail.

DONE.
