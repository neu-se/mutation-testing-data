 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called when the promise is rejected, and the rejection will not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called when the promise is rejected, and the rejection will not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would not be called when the promise is rejected, and the rejection will not be removed from the `unhandledRejections` array.

In all three cases, the difference in behavior is that the rejection will not be properly tracked and handled, which could lead to issues in the application. DONE.
