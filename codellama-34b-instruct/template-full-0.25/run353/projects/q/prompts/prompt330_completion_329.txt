  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a non-null value as its argument. If `null` is passed, it will be treated as a resolved promise, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a non-undefined value as its argument. If `undefined` is passed, it will be treated as a resolved promise, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("some error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects an error object as its argument. If a different type of object is passed, it will be treated as a resolved promise, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
