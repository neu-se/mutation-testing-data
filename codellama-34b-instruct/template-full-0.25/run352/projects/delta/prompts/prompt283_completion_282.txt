  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, while `length` returns the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, while `charAt(0)` returns the first character of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, while `substr(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character.

DONE.
