  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a specific complex number, while the mutated code would return the number 42.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a specific complex number, while the mutated code would return NaN (Not a Number).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return a specific complex number, while the mutated code would return Infinity.

DONE.
