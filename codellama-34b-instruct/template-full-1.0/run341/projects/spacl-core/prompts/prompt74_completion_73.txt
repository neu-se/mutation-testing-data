  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
res !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `res !== true` would return `true` for any value of `res` that is not `true`, whereas the original code would only return `true` if `res` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because `!res` would return `true` for any value of `res` that is not `true`, whereas the original code would only return `true` if `res` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
res === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `res === null` would return `true` if `res` is `null`, whereas the original code would only return `true` if `res` is `false`.

DONE.
