  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different type for the `lastOp.delete` property, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different type for the `lastOp.delete` property, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' &&
        typeof lastOp.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return a different type for the `lastOp.delete` property, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`.
