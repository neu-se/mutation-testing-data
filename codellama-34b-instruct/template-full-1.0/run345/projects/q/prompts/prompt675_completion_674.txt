  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a different function than `apply`, and it would not pass the specified arguments to the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound context and parameters, but it does not immediately invoke the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"valueOf"
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` is a different method than `apply`, and it would not pass the specified arguments to the method.

DONE.
