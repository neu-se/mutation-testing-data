  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would reject the promise instead of resolving it, which would cause the promise chain to fail instead of succeeding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` would create a new promise that would resolve immediately, rather than waiting for the original promise to resolve. This would cause the promise chain to proceed immediately, rather than waiting for the original promise to complete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would create a new defer object, which would not be related to the original promise or its resolution. This would cause the promise chain to fail, as the new defer object would not have any resolution callbacks attached to it.

DONE.
