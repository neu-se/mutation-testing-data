 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fileNameAndLineNumber === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returns `undefined` when it can't find a match, not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function returns `undefined` when it can't find a match, not a defined variable of value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fileNameAndLineNumber.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function always returns an array with two elements, even if the first element is an empty string.

DONE.
