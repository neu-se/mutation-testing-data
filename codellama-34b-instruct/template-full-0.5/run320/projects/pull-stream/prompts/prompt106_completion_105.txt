  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a callback function that is expected to be called when the `drain` function is finished, while `null` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a callback function that is expected to be called when the `drain` function is finished, while `undefined` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` is a callback function that is expected to be called when the `drain` function is finished, while the new code fragment `() => {}` is an empty function that will not be called.

DONE.
