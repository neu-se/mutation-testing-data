  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not capture the variable name in the path specification, resulting in a different regular expression and potentially different matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not capture the variable name in the path specification, resulting in a different regular expression and potentially different matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('/([^/]+)')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not capture the variable name in the path specification, resulting in a different regular expression and potentially different matches.

DONE.
