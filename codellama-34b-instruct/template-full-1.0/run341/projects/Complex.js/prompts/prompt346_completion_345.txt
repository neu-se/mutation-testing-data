  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment is always checking whether the value 0 is equal to zero, which will always return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment is always checking whether the negative of `a` is equal to zero, which will always return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking whether `a` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment is always checking whether `a + 1` is equal to zero, which will always return false.

DONE.
