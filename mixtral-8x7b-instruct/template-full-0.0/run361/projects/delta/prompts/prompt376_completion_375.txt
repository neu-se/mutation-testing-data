 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peek()?.type === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the `type` property on the peeked element, which is not necessary since `peekType()` already returns the type directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === 'Insert'
