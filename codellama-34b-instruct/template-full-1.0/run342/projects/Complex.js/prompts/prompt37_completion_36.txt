  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was testing for zero, but this replacement would always be non-zero, causing the function to enter the `if` block unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was testing for zero, but this replacement would always be zero, causing the function to enter the `if` block unconditionally.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was testing for zero, but this replacement would always be non-zero, causing the function to enter the `if` block unconditionally.

DONE.
