  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last && <PLACEHOLDER>(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `last` variable is only checked if the `test` function returns `false`. In the original code, the `cb` function is only called if `test` returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called if `test` returns `true`. In the original code, the `cb` function is called regardless of the result of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
terminate(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `terminate` function is called if `test` returns `true`, but it is not called if `test` returns `false` in the original code.

DONE.
