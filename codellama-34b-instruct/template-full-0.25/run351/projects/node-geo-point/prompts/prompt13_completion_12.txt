  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array with fewer than 2 elements to be passed as the `coordinates` property of the `point` object, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array with more than 2 elements to be passed as the `coordinates` property of the `point` object, which is not allowed by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an empty array to be passed as the `coordinates` property of the `point` object, which is not allowed by the original code.

DONE.
