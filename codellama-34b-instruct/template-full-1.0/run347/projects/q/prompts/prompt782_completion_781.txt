  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x => x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the pending promise, instead of the fulfillment value, which is what the original code fragment was expecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, instead of the fulfillment value, which is what the original code fragment was expecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, instead of the fulfillment value, which is what the original code fragment was expecting.

DONE.
