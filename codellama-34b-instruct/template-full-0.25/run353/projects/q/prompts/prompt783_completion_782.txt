  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, progressed);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(void 0, void 0, function (value) { return value; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the progress callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

DONE.
