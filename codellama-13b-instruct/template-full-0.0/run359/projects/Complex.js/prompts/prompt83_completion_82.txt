  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true when there is still something on the stack, which would cause the parser to exit with an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be false when there is still something on the stack, which would cause the parser to continue parsing the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be true only when there is exactly one token on the stack, which would cause the parser to exit with an error.

DONE.
