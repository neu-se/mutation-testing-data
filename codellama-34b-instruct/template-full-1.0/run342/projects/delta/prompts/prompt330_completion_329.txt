  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsey value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if the condition inside the parentheses is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if the condition inside the parentheses is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if the condition inside the parentheses is true.

DONE.
