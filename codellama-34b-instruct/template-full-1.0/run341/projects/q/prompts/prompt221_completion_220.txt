  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function creates a new object with a specific prototype, whereas `null` is not a function and would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_create` function creates a new object with a specific prototype, whereas `undefined` is not a function and would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var deferred = defer.prototype;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer.prototype` object has a different structure and function than the `object_create` function, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
