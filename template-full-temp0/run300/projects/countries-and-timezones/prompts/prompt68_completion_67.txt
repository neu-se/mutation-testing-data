  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!country.id
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `country` variable is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if the `id` property of the `country` object is falsy.

DONE.
