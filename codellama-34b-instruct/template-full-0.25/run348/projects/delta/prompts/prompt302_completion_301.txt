  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first character of the line and start from the second character instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start from the second character of the line instead of the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start from the previous character of the line instead of the first character.

DONE.
