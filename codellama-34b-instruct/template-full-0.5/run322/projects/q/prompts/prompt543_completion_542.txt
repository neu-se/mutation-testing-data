  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object, rather than `void 0`, which is a way to represent the `undefined` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is a way to represent the `undefined` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because `123` is a number, whereas `void 0` is a way to represent the `undefined` value.

DONE.
