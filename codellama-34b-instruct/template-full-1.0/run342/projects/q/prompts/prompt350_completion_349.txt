  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.parent
```
This would result in different behavior because `self` is used to refer to the current promise object, while `self.parent` would refer to the parent promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which is not necessarily the same as the promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have any methods that can be called.

DONE.
