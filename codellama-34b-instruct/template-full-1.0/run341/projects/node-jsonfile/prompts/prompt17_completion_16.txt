  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (options === 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for equality, whereas the original fragment used the `typeof` operator to check the type of `options`. If `options` is not a string, the behavior of the two fragments would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (options !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, whereas the original fragment used the `typeof` operator to check the type of `options`. If `options` is null, the behavior of the two fragments would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof options !== 'object')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original fragment used the `typeof` operator to check the type of `options`. If `options` is not an object,
