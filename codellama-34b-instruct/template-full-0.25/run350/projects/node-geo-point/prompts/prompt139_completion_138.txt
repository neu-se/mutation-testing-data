  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function is being called with the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property, which could cause the `adjustPrecision` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function is being called with a different value than the original code, which could cause the `adjustPrecision` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `adjust` function is being called with a different value than the original code, which could cause the `adjustPrecision` method to return a different result.

DONE.
