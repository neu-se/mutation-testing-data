 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` callback would be called with `undefined` instead of the actual value of the promise. This could potentially cause issues if the `fulfilled` callback is expecting a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` callback would be called with `null` instead of the actual value of the promise. This could potentially cause issues if the `fulfilled` callback is expecting a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
callback(generator)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fulfilled` callback would be called with the `generator` object instead of the resolved value of the promise. This could potentially cause issues if the `fulfilled` callback is not designed to handle generator objects.

DONE.
