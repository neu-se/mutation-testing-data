  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!-- cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not called, and therefore the callback will not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (`!`) is used on the `cb` function, which will invert the truthiness of the function. This means that if the function is not callable, the negation will return `true`, and if the function is callable, the negation will return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called with the argument `true`, which may have a different effect than calling the function with no arguments or with an error object.

DONE.
