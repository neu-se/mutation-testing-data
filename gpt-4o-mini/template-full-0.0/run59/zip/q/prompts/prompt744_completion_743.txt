Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to reject immediately upon the first rejection instead of resolving with the first fulfilled promise, effectively changing the intended functionality of the `any` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { deferred.resolve(null); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `null` regardless of the actual result of the fulfilled promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of the resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onProgress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the progress handler instead of the fulfillment handler, which means that the promise would not resolve with the fulfilled value but instead trigger progress notifications, altering the expected outcome of the `any` method.

DONE.
