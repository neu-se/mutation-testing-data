  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `value` is a promise itself. This would cause the code to treat `value` as a promise that resolves to a promise, rather than a promise that resolves to a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `value` is a promise itself. This would cause the code to treat `value` as a promise that resolves to a promise, rather than a promise that resolves to a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `value` is a promise itself. This would cause the code to treat `value` as a promise that resolves to a promise, rather than a promise that resolves to
