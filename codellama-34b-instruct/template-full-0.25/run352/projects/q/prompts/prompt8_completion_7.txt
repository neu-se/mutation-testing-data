  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return early, without executing the rest of the code in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error, causing the rest of the code in the function to not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a rejected promise, which would cause the rest of the code in the function to not be executed.

DONE.
