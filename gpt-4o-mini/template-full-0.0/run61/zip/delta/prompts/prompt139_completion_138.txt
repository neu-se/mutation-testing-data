Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method being called from `peekType`, which returns the type of the next operation, to `peekLength`, which returns the length of the next operation, potentially altering the logic that depends on the type of operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it switches the context from `thisIter` to `otherIter`, meaning the code would now be checking the type of the next operation in the `other` delta instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a condition that checks if the next operation is a 'delete' instead of checking if it is 'insert', which would change the flow of the logic and potentially skip necessary operations.

DONE.
