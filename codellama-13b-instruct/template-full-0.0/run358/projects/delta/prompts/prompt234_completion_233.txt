  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` object onto the `retDelta` array, which would cause the `diff()` method to return a delta that includes the `otherOp` object, even if it is not present in the original delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `thisOp` object onto the `retDelta` array, which would cause the `diff()` method to return a delta that includes the `thisOp` object, even if it is not present in the original delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `newOp` object onto the `retDelta` array, which would cause the `diff()` method to return a delta that includes the `newOp` object, even
