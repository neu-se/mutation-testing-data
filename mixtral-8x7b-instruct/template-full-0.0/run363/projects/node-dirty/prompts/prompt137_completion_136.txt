 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.has` checks if a key exists in the map, but it doesn't return the value associated with the key. The original code fragment `this._data.get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.set` sets the value associated with the key in the map, but it doesn't return the value associated with the key. The original code fragment `this._data.get` returns the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.delete` removes the key-value pair from the map and returns a boolean indicating whether the key was present in the map. The original code fragment `this._data.get` returns
