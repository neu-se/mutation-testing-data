  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 10;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 10 instead of the original value of `k`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = "hello";
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate through the characters of the string "hello" instead of the original values of `sources`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = sources.push(-1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate through the values of `sources` and also push the value -1 into the array `sources`.

DONE.
