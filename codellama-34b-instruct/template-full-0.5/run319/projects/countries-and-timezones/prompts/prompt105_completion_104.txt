  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `tzs[key]` by 2, which would change the output of the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the value of `tzs[key]` to uppercase, which would change the output of the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key].split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split('').reverse().join('')` method would reverse the order of the characters in `tzs[key]`, which would change the output of the `
