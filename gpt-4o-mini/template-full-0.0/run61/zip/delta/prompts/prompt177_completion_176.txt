Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the source of the length being evaluated from the `otherIter` to `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect operations being performed based on the wrong set of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation from `otherIter` instead of checking the length of the next operation, which could lead to skipping necessary operations and altering the expected output of the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length to zero, which would cause the code to not process any operations from `thisIter` or `otherIter`, effectively ignoring them and resulting in an incomplete or incorrect `Delta` object.

DONE.
