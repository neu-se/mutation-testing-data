  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.invert(otherOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined for the `attributes` property, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.transform(otherOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transform` method is not defined for the `attributes` property, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.invert(otherOp.attributes, priority)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method is not defined for the `attributes` property, and would therefore cause a runtime error.

DONE.
