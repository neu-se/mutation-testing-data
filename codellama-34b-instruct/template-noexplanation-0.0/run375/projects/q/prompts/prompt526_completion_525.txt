  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This code fragment will return the first element of the `args` array, which is the first argument passed to the `dispatch` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This code fragment will return the length of the `args` array, which is the number of arguments passed to the `dispatch` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of the `args` array except the first one, which is the first argument passed to the `dispatch` function.

DONE.
