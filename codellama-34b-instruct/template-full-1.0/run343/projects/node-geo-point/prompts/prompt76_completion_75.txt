  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment always returns a `Number` object, while `Math.random()` returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment parses the provided string and returns a `Number` object, while `Number("")` returns the number 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a `Number` object, while the new function returns the number 0.

DONE.
