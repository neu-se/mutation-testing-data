Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/a/, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for replacing the last character of a word with "e" would instead remove the last character of any word containing the letter "
