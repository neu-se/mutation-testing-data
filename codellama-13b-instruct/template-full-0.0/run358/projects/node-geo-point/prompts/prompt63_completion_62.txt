  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `φ2` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `φ1` variable is defined in the `calculateBearing` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosφ1` variable is defined in the `calculateBearing` method, and the `cosφ2` variable is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinφ1` variable is defined in the `calculateBearing` method, and the `sinφ2` variable is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
