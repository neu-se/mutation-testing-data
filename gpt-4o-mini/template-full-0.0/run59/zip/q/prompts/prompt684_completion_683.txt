Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only retrieves the first argument instead of slicing the arguments array, potentially leading to incorrect function calls with missing parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of arguments passed instead of the actual arguments themselves, which would cause the function to fail when trying to apply the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is not an array and does not have a `slice` method, leading to a runtime error instead of correctly slicing the arguments.

DONE.
