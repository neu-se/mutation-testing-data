  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only called `read` with the `abort` argument, while the new code fragment also passes `cb` or an anonymous function as a second argument. This could cause the `read` function to behave differently, potentially leading to different behavior in the `drain` function.

DONE.
