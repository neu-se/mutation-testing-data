  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` schedules a function to be called repeatedly, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called once after a specified delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` schedules a function to be called immediately after the current event loop, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a specified delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` schedules a function to be called before the next repaint, while `setTimeout` schedules a function to be called after a specified delay.

DONE.
