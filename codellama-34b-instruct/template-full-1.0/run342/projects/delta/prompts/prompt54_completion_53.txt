  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `ops.length > 0` would cause the code to ignore any empty arrays passed in as `ops`, which may be unexpected and could cause the `Delta` class to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) || ops instanceof Delta
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `ops instanceof Delta` would cause the code to treat `Delta` objects as arrays, which may be unexpected and could cause the `Delta` class to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) && !(ops instanceof Delta)
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional check for `!(ops instanceof Delta)` would cause the code to only accept arrays that are not `Delta` objects, which may be unexpected and
