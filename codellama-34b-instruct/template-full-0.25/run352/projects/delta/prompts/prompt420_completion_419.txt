  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` returns the largest of the two values, whereas `Math.min` returns the smallest.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length from the index, whereas the original code fragment adds the length to the index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the length from the offset, whereas the original code fragment adds the length to the offset.

DONE.
