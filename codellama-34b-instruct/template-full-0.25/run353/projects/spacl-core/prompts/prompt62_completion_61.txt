  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `props.reverse`, which is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while the new code fragment is `props.reverse()`, which is a method that reverses the order of the characters in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `props.reverse`, which is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while the new code fragment is `props.sort()`, which is a method that sorts the elements in an array in ascending order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `props.reverse`, which is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, while the new code fragment is `props.pop()`, which is a method that removes
