 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the `this` keyword, which could potentially reference a different object depending on the context in which the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Array.prototype.concat` method, which is intended for concatenating arrays, rather than the `Delta.concat` method, which is intended for concatenating `Delta` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because it references a non-existent `Math.concat` method, which would throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

DONE.
