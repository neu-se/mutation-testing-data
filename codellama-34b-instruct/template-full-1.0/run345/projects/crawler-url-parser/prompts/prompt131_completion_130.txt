Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/');
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `replace` function would remove the entire path component instead of just the index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '').replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/');

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '');
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `replace`
