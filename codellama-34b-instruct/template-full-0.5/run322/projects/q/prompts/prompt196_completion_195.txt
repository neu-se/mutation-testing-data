  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is a function that returns an array of two values, the first being the file name and the second being the line number. By using `getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]`, we are only accessing the first element of the array, which is the file name. This would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, as the file name is not equal to `qFileName` and the line number is not between `qStartingLine` and `qEndingLine`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `getFileNameAndLineNumber` is a function that returns an array of two values, the first being the file name and the second being the line number. By using `getFileNameAndLineNumber[1]`, we are only accessing the second element of the array, which is the line number. This would cause the `
