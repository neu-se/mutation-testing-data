  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring would start from the second character instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.99
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring would start from a non-integer index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring would start from the index of the first occurrence of the character "a" instead of the first character.

DONE.
