  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `length()` method, whereas the original code fragment does not include them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator is used to add 1 to the result of the `length()` method, whereas the original code fragment does not include this operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator is used to subtract 1 from the result of the `length()` method, whereas the original code fragment does not include this operation.

DONE.
