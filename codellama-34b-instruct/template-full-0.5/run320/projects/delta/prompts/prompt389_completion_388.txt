  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` would return the value of the `peekLength` property on the `otherIter` object, which is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peek().length` would return the length of the next operation in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek` returns the next operation in the iterator, while `otherIter.peek().retain` would return the `retain` property of the next operation in the iterator.

DONE.
