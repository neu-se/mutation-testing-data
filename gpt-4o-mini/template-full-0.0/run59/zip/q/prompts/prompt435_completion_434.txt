Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "string" && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly checks if `process` is a string instead of an object, which will always evaluate to false, preventing the tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process === "object" && typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `process.emit` is undefined, which would lead to the rejection tracking logic being skipped even if `process` is a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, which would allow the tracking of unhandled rejections even if `process` is not an object, leading to incorrect behavior in the rejection handling.

DONE.
