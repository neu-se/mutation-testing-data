  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a legal value for the `thisp` argument in the call to `value.apply()`, whereas `value` is a property of the `this` object and is therefore a legal value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a legal value for the `thisp` argument in the call to `value.apply()`, whereas `value` is a property of the `this` object and is therefore a legal value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Q().post` function, whereas `value` refers to the `fulfill` function.

DONE.
