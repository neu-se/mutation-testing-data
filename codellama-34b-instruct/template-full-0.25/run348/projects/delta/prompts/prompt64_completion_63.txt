  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.unshift(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the beginning of the `ops` array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the specified index, but it would also remove the existing operation at that index, rather than replacing it.

DONE.
