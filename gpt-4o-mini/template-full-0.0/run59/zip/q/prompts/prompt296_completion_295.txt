Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).reject(y);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of attempting to join the two promises, it would reject the promise with `y`, leading to a failure in the promise chain if `x` is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).resolve(y);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with `y` regardless of the value of `x`, ignoring the equality check that is supposed to ensure both promises fulfill to the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join(x);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to join `y` with `x` instead of `x` with `y`, potentially leading to different outcomes based on the fulfillment values of the promises.

DONE.
