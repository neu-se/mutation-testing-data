Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === 'j' || tokens[i + 1] === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the character 'j' instead of 'i', which would cause the parser to incorrectly interpret complex numbers that use 'j' as the imaginary unit, leading to potential parsing errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === ' ' || tokens[i + 1] === '\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for whitespace characters instead of 'i' or 'I', which would cause the parser to skip over valid imaginary unit indicators, resulting in incorrect parsing of complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] === '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks specifically for the character '0', which would incorrectly treat a complex number with an imaginary part of zero as invalid, potentially leading to parsing failures for valid complex numbers.

DONE.
