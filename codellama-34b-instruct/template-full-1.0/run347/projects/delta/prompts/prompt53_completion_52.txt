  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler` is an optional parameter in the `registerEmbed()` method, and if it is not provided, the function will throw an error. By replacing `!handler` with `handler !== undefined`, the function will only throw an error if `handler` is not undefined and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler` can be null in addition to being undefined. By replacing `!handler` with `handler != null`, the function will only throw an error if `handler` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` operator will return the type of `handler` as a string, so `typeof handler` will never be equal to `undefined`. By replacing `!handler` with `typeof handler !== 'undefined'`, the function will only throw an error
