 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not include parentheses, which means that the `peekLength` method is not being invoked. Adding parentheses will cause the method to be invoked, potentially changing the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.length
