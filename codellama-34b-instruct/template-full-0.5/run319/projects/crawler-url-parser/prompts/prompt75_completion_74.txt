  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the letter "a" is not the same as the word "base" in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'basee'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "basee" is not the same as the word "base" in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base'.replace('b', 'c')
```
This would result in different behavior because the letter "c" is not the same as the letter "b" in the original code fragment.

DONE.
