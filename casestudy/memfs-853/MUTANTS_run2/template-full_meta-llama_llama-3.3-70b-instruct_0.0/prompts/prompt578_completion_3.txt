Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation name in the error message from 'open' to 'close', potentially masking the actual issue when a file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
link.getPath() + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a slash to the file path in the error message, which could lead to incorrect error messages when a file already exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the operation name from the error message, making it less informative and potentially more difficult to debug when a file already exists.

DONE.
