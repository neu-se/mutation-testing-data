  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit prematurely if the number of plus signs is greater than the number of minus signs, even if there are still tokens to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit prematurely if the number of plus signs plus the number of minus signs is greater than 1, even if there are still tokens to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to exit prematurely if the number of plus signs is equal to the number of minus signs, even if there are still tokens to be processed.

DONE.
