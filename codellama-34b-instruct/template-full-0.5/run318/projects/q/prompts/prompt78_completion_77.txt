  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function call, while `flush` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` schedules the function call to be executed after a specified delay, while `flush` is executed immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestAnimationFrame(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestAnimationFrame` schedules the function call to be executed before the next repaint of the screen, while `flush` is executed immediately.

DONE.
