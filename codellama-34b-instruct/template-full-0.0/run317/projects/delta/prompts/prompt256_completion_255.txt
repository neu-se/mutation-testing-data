  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the attributes of the two operations are equal, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) || thisOp.attributes === otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either the insert or the attributes of the two operations are equal, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEqual(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert) && thisOp.attributes !== otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the insert of the two operations is equal and the attributes are not equal, which is not checked in the original code fragment.

DONE.
