Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the starting index from `0` to `1` would cause the function to omit the first character of the word when forming the plural, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "cherry" which would incorrectly become "herrie".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `-1` as the starting index would cause the function to start the substring from the end of the word, effectively returning an empty string for any word that ends with 'y', which is not the intended behavior for pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the starting index to `2` would cause the function to skip the first two characters of the word, resulting in incorrect plural forms such as turning "cherry" into "rries", which is not a valid pluralization.

DONE.
