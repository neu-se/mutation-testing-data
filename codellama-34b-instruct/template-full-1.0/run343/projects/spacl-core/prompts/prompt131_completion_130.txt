  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop !== undefined || match[index + 1] === prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!==` is used instead of `===` for the comparison, which would cause the `true` branch to be taken when `prop` is undefined, rather than the `false` branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop === undefined || match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison `prop === undefined` is always true, so the `true` branch would be taken regardless of the value of `prop`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the check for `prop` being undefined, which could cause the code to produce inconsistent results if `prop` is undefined.

DONE.
