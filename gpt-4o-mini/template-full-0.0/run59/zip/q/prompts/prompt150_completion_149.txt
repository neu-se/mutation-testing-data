Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the `stack` property of the `promise` object to the `source` property, which may not exist or may not contain the expected stack trace, leading to incomplete or incorrect stack information.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stackCounter
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the stack trace with the `stackCounter` property, which is likely a numeric value rather than a string representation of the stack trace, resulting in a loss of meaningful error context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error stack not available"
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the actual stack trace with a static string, which would not provide any useful debugging information, making it difficult to trace the source of the error.

DONE.
