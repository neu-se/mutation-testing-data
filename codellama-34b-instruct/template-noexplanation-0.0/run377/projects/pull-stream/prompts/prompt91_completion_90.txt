  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns a truthy value. This will cause the `cb` function to never be called, and the `ended` variable to never be set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if the `test` function returns a truthy value. This will cause the `cb` function to never be called, and the `ended` variable to never be set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || false
```
This change will cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the `test` function returns a falsy value. This will cause the `cb` function to always be called, and the `ended` variable to always be set to `true`.

DONE.
