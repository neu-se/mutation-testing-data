  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method is expecting the `latitude` property to be present in the input object, but it is actually the `longitude` property that is present. This would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` instead of returning a `GeoPoint` object.
