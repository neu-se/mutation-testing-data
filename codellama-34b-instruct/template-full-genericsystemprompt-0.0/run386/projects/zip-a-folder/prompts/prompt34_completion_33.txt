  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called asynchronously instead of synchronously, which could cause the promise to resolve before the error is handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', (err) => reject(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called with a different argument, which could cause the promise to reject with a different error.

DONE.
