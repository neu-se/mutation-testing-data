  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this code fragment checks if the array has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this code fragment checks if the array has a length less than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the array is falsy, while this code fragment checks if the array has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
