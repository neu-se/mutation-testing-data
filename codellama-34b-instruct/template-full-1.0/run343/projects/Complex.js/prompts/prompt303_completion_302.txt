  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` and `b` instead of using `a` as the input for `Math.sin()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the negative of `a` as the input for `Math.sin()` instead of the original `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use `Math.cos()` instead of `Math.sin()` for the input `a`.

DONE.
