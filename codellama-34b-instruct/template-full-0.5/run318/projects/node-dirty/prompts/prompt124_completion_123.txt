  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being passed to the `write` method, which could cause errors to be missed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    this.emit('error', err);
  }
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is not being passed to the `write` method, which could cause errors to be missed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.write(data, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    this.emit('error', err);
  }
  this._writeStream.end();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is being called on the write stream, which could cause the stream to close before all data has been
