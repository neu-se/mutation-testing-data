  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `pageurl` argument, which is not the same as calling it with `sourceUrl`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `URL.parse` method with the `pageurl` argument, which is not the same as calling it with `sourceUrl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(pageurl, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `URL.parse` method with the `pageurl` argument and the `true` argument, which is not the same as calling it with `sourceUrl`.

DONE.
