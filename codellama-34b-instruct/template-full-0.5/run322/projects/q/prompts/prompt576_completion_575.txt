  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null, "next")` would bind the `continuer` function to the `null` context, which would cause the function to be called with the global object as `this`, rather than the `generator` object. This would likely cause an error to be thrown, as the `continuer` function expects to be called with a `generator` object as `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.bind(null, "throw")` would bind the `continuer` function to the `null` context, which would cause the function to be called with the global object as `this`, rather than the `generator` object. This would likely cause an error to be thrown, as the `continuer` function expects to be called with a `generator` object as `this`.
