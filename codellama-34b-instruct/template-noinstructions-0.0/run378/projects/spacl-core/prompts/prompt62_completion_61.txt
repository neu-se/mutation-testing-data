  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas the original code fragment `props.reverse` would return a new array with the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(0)` method creates a shallow copy of the array, and then the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the copy, whereas the original code fragment `props.reverse` would return a new array with the elements in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.concat().reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the elements of the original array with the elements of another array, and then the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the new array, whereas the original code fragment
