  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a bound context, which in this case would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with a `null` context, rather than the expected `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` immediately calls the `onUnhandledError` function with a `null` context, rather than creating a new function with a bound context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` immediately calls the `onUnhandledError` function with a `null` context, and applies the arguments as an array, rather than creating a new function with a bound context.

DONE.
