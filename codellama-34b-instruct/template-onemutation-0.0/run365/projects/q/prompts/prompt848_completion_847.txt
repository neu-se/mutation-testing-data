  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while the modified code fragment creates a deferred object with a null value. This could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected differently, depending on the implementation of the `defer` function.

DONE.
