  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'debug'`, which could cause unexpected behavior in code that listens for the `'error'` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is not a valid event name, and the `emit` method would throw an error when trying to emit an event with an undefined name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'load'`, which could cause unexpected behavior in code that listens for the `'error'` event.

DONE.
