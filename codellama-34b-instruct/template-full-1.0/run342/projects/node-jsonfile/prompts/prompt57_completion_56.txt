  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ /g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of two or more spaces, rather than just a single newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any sequence of two or more return characters, rather than just a single newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^\n]/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character that is not a newline, rather than just a single newline character.

DONE.
