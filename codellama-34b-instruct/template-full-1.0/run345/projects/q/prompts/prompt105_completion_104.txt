  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index] + 1, index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `index` to be incremented before it is used, which would result in different behavior when the loop is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, this[index] - 1, index
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `index` to be decremented before it is used, which would result in different behavior when the loop is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basis, index, index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `index` to be incremented before it is used, which would result in different behavior when the loop is executed.

DONE.
