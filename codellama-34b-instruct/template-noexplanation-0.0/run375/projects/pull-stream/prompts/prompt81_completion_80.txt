  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Function
```
This code fragment checks if `err` is an instance of the `Function` class, which is not the same as checking if it is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err === 'function'
```
This code fragment checks if the type of `err` is a function, which is the same as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.constructor === Function
```
This code fragment checks if the constructor of `err` is the `Function` class, which is not the same as checking if it is a function.

DONE.
