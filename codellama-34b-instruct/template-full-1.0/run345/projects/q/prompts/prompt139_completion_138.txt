  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to access the `source` property of `null` instead of the `promise` object, leading to a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to access the `source` property of `undefined` instead of the `promise` object, leading to a `TypeError` being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = !promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would attempt to access the `source` property of the negation of the `promise` object, which would not exist, leading to a `TypeError` being thrown.

DONE.
