  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any object, regardless of whether the key exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any key, regardless of whether the object has the key or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any object and key, regardless of whether the object has the key or not.

DONE.
