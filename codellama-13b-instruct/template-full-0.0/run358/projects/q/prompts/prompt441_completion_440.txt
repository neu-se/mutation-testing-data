  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to a property. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to a property. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to a property. This could cause the code to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
