  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!unique
```
This would result in different behavior because `!unique` would negate the result of the `unique` function, causing the `nonUnique` function to always return `true`, regardless of whether the item is unique or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.bind(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context and arguments, but in this case, the context is `null` and the argument is `true`. This would cause the `unique` function to always return `true`, regardless of whether the item is unique or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unique.call(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls a function with a specific context and arguments, but in this case, the context is `null` and the argument is `true`. This would cause the `unique` function to always return `true
