  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function has a different range of values than the `sin` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.im
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `z` is a complex number and has an imaginary part that is not necessarily equal to its real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*b
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying two numbers together can result in a different value than taking the `sin` of one of those numbers.

DONE.
