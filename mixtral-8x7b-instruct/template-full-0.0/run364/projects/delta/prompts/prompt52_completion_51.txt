 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the second key of the object `b`, which might not exist, causing an error. The original code fragment `b` simply refers to the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the object `b` with an empty object. The original code fragment `b` retains the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a deep copy of the object `b`. The original code fragment `b` refers to the original object, and any changes made to it would affect the original object.

DONE.
