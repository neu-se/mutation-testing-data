  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `abortCb(aborted)` would call the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` error, which may have a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)` would call the `cb` function with the `aborted` error, while the new code fragment `cb(null, data)` would call the `cb` function with a `null` error and the `data` value, which may have a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb(aborted)`
