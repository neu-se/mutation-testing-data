  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch()` method will return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one, which may cause the code to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch()` method will return a resolved promise with value `null` instead of the expected value, which may cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.dispatch()` method will return a resolved promise with value `{}` (an empty object) instead of the expected value, which may cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
