  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname + '.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a dot to the end of the pathname, which would cause the `path.basename` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first character of the pathname, which would cause the `path.basename` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the pathname by slashes and return the last element of the resulting array, which would cause the `path.basename` function to return a different value.

DONE.
