  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would only iterate over the property "1" of the object, instead of all the properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "key";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would only iterate over the property "key" of the object, instead of all the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over a random property of the object, instead of all the properties.

DONE.
