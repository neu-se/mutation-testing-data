 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => laterQueue.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first element from the `laterQueue` array instead of the last one, potentially changing the order of task execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
    laterQueue.pop();
    runSingle(task);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls `runSingle(task)` after popping an element from the `laterQueue` array, bypassing the original condition that checks if the `laterQueue` is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
    laterQueue.length > 0 && runSingle(laterQueue.pop());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it only calls `runSingle(task)` if the `laterQueue` is not empty, changing the behavior of handling tasks in the `laterQueue
