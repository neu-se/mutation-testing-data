Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `options.url` is explicitly `undefined`, which would not catch cases where `options.url` is an empty string or `null`, potentially allowing the function to proceed without a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.url && options.url !== ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `options.url` is falsy and also explicitly checks if it is not an empty string, which could lead to a situation where a valid URL (like `null` or `undefined`) is incorrectly considered valid if it is not an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality to check for both `null` and `undefined`, which may allow other falsy values (like an empty string) to pass through, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the function.

DONE.
