  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches URLs that have a fragment component (i.e., the part of the URL after the `#` symbol), while the new code fragment matches URLs that start with a `#` symbol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence of a `#` symbol in the URL, while the new code fragment matches all occurrences of a `#` symbol.

DONE.
