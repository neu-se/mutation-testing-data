  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` would immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` would wait for any buffered data to be written before closing the stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` with a null argument would immediately close the write stream, whereas `end()` without an argument would wait for any buffered data to be written before closing the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` with an error argument would immediately close the write stream and emit an error event, whereas `end()` without an argument would wait for any buffered data to be written before closing the stream.

DONE.
