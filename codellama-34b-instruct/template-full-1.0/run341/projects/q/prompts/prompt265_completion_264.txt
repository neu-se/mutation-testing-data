  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a constant value instead of using the resolved value from the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ value }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an object with a property `value` instead of using the resolved value from the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with the resolved value from the promise as the only element.

DONE.
