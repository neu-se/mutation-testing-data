 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect` method without passing the `<PLACEHOLDER>` as an argument. This change would cause the `nearer` function to always return the inspected object, even if it's a promise, which is different from the original behavior that checks the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the argument to the `inspect` method. This change would cause the `nearer` function to always return the input value if it's not a promise, or the inspected promise if it's a promise, regardless of its state. This is different from the original behavior that checks the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `value`
