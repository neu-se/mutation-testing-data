Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the '$' character with another '$' instead of two '$$' characters, potentially leading to incorrect string replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the escaping of the '$' character altogether, potentially causing issues with string replacement if the target path contains '$' characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'&'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a different special character, '&', which might not be handled correctly by the string replacement logic, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected results.

DONE.
