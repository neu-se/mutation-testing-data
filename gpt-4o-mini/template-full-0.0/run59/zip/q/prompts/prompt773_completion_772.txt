Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call `allSettled` on the native `Promise` object instead of the `Q` library's implementation, potentially leading to different handling of promise states and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `all` method instead of `allSettled`, which means it would resolve only when all promises are fulfilled, rather than returning the states of all promises regardless of their fulfillment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a rejected promise immediately, rather than inspecting the promises and returning their states, leading to an immediate rejection instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

DONE.
