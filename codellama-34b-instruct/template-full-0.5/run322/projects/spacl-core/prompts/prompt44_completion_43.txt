  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code is missing the `reverse()` method call on `props`, which would cause the `props` array to be in the wrong order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code is using the wrong regex pattern to match the `part` string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(`/${part.replace(/([.$])/g, '\\$1')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement code is using a different string concatenation method to build the `parts` array.

DONE.
