  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not defined on the `object` variable, and would throw a `TypeError` if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.thenResolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenResolve` method is not defined on the `object` variable, and would throw a `TypeError` if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thenReject` method is not defined on the `object` variable, and would throw a `TypeError` if called.

DONE.
