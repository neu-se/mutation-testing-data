  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last slash from the URL, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the last slash, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would escape the last slash twice, which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently.

DONE.
