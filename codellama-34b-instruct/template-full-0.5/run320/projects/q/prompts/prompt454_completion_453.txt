  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the stack trace in the error message, which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the error message in the error message, which is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the name of the error in the error message, which is not present in the original code.

DONE.
