  As a mutation testing expert, I will provide three different code fragments to replace the `PLACEHOLDER` in the original code, each with a brief explanation of the different behavior it will result in:

Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 3
```
This will result in different behavior because the function expects only two arguments, but the code fragment checks for three arguments. If the function is called with three arguments, the function will return a different result, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length === 1
```
This will result in different behavior because the function expects two arguments, but the code fragment checks for only one argument. This will cause the function to execute differently, potentially resulting in a different outcome and failing the test suite.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
typeof arguments[0] === 'number'
```
This will result in different behavior because the function expects a function as the first argument, but
