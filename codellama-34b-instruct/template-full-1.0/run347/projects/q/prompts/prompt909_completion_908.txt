  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 1, but the replaced code is 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 1, but the replaced code is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was 1, but the replaced code is -1.

DONE.
