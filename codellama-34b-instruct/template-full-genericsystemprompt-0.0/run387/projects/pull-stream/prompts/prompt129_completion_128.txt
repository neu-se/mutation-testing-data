  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the `end` argument, while this modified code fragment calls the `cb` function with both the `end` and `i++` arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `i` variable and passes it as an argument to the `cb` function, while this modified code fragment passes the `max` variable as an argument to the `cb` function instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments the `i` variable and passes it as an argument to the `cb` function, while this modified code fragment passes the `i + 1` expression as an argument to the `cb` function instead.
