  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that repeatedly calls a given function with a fixed time delay between each call, while `setTimeout` is a function that calls a given function after a fixed delay.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the execution of the `flush` function by 1 second, while the original code does not have any delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delay the execution of the `flush` function by 0 seconds, which is equivalent to calling the function immediately, while the original code delays the execution by 0 seconds.

DONE.
