  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `http` protocol with `https`, which could cause issues with websites that don't support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://www.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `www.` to the domain name, which could cause issues with websites that don't have a `www` subdomain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the domain name with `example.com`, which could cause issues with websites that don't have that domain name.

DONE.
