  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) + cos(φ1) * sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the constant `1` to be added to the return value of the `sinφ2` function, which would change the output of the `calculateDestination` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinφ2 * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosθ` function to be called with the argument `φ2`, which would change the output of the `calculateDestination` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) + cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` function to be called with the argument `φ1`, which would change the output of the `calculateDestination` function.
