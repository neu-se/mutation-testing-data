  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects a promise-returning function as its first argument, and `null` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects a promise-returning function as its first argument, and a string is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.timeout` expects a promise-returning function as its first argument, and an anonymous function is not a promise-returning function.

DONE.
