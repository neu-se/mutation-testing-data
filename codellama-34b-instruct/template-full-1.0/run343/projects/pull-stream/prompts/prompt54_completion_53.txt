  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the value, meaning that it would return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!s
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the variable `s`, which has a different result than inverting the value of the `s.sink` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `source` property of the `s` object, rather than the `sink` property.

DONE.
