  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `name` to uppercase, which may not match the expected result of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` would return a new string that is a substring of the original `name` string, starting from the second character. This may not match the expected result of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('').reverse().join('')` would split the `name` string into individual characters, reverse the order of the characters, and then join them together to form a new string. This may not match the expected result of the original code fragment.

DONE.
