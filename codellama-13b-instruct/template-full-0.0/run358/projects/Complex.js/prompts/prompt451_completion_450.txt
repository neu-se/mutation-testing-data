  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is being compared instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] + this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number is being added instead of subtracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the real part of the complex number is being multiplied instead of subtracted.

DONE.
