  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the negation operator `!` to invert the value of `aborted`. This could cause the `next` function to behave differently depending on the value of `aborted`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted` variable directly, while the new code fragment always returns `false`. This could cause the `next` function to behave differently depending on the value of `aborted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `aborted` variable directly, while the new code fragment uses the `undefined` value. This could cause the `next` function to behave differently depending on the value of `aborted`.

DONE.
