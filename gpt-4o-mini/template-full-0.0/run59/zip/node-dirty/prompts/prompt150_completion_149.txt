Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.forEach(cb => cb(err));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call all callbacks in the `cbs` array with the error, instead of just calling the first callback, potentially leading to multiple error handling executions instead of just one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback with a `null` error, indicating success, regardless of whether there was an actual error during the write operation, which could mislead the caller into thinking the write was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('An error occurred');
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string as an error message instead of an actual error object, which could lead to incorrect error handling since the callback is expected to receive an error object.

DONE.
