 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.thenResolve` function would receive `Promise.resolve(null)` instead of `promise`. This might not cause any test failures directly, but it could expose issues with how the code handles resolved promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Artificial error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenReject` would receive `Q.reject(new Error('Artificial error'))` instead of `promise`. This would immediately reject the promise, which might expose issues with how the code handles rejected promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.thenResolve` would receive `Q.resolve(42)` instead of `promise`. This would fulfill the promise with the value `42`, which
