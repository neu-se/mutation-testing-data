  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the current timezone array, while `push()` adds a new element to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.timezones[country].current.push(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the new timezone to the `current` array of the corresponding country in the `timezones` object, rather than to the `all` array of the current country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.unshift(id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift()` adds a new element to the beginning of the `all` array, rather than to the end of the array as `push()` does.

DONE.
