  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at + 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the wrong reason for the rejection, potentially causing confusion or incorrect handling of the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", unhandledReasons[at - 1], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit the wrong reason for the rejection, potentially causing confusion or incorrect handling of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled", null, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit a null reason for the rejection, potentially causing confusion or incorrect handling of the rejection.

DONE.
