  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a)` returns the value of `expm1(a)`, which is different from `expm1(a) * Math.cos(b) + cosm1(b)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a, b)` is not a valid method in JavaScript's `Math` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.expm1(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.expm1(a + b)` returns the value of `expm1(a + b)`, which is different from `expm1(a) * Math.cos(b) + cosm1(b)`.

DONE.
