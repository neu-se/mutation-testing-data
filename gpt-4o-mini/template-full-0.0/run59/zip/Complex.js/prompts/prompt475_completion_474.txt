Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number is NaN instead of the imaginary part, which would lead to incorrect results when the imaginary part is NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the imaginary part before checking if it is NaN, which would incorrectly return false even if the imaginary part is NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the imaginary part by 2 before checking if it is NaN, which would also incorrectly return false if the imaginary part is NaN, as NaN multiplied by any number is still NaN.

DONE.
