Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly increases the length by 1, potentially causing an out-of-bounds error or incorrect operation when trying to retrieve operations from `thisIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the maximum of the two lengths instead of the minimum, which could lead to attempting to process more operations than available in `otherIter`, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the length by 1, which may cause the code to skip processing the last operation in `otherIter`, leading to incomplete or incorrect delta operations.

DONE.
