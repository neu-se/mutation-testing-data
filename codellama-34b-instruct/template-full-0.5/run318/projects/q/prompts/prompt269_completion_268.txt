  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` will throw an error, whereas `reject` will reject the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` will return the value, whereas `reject` will reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` will resolve the promise, whereas `reject` will reject the promise.

DONE.
