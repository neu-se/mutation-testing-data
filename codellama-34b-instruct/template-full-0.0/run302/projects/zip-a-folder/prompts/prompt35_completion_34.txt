  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('error', reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('error', reject)` event listener would be added to the `output` stream instead of the `zipArchive` stream, which could cause the `reject` function to be called with an error object even if the `zipArchive` stream is successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output).on('close', resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on('close',
