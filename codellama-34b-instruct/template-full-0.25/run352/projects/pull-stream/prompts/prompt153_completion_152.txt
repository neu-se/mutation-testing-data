  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `abort && onAbort` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `true` if both `abort` and `onAbort` are truthy. This change would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `!abort` is a boolean expression that evaluates to `true` if `abort` is falsy. This change would cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || onAbort
```
This would result in
