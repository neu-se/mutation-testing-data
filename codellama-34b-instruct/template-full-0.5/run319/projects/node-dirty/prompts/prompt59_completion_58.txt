  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with the number of items in the queue, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with the number of items in the data map, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted with the number of in-flight writes, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
