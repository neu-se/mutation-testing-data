  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 1, while this replacement checks for greater than 1, which would result in a different outcome in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff != 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 1, while this replacement checks for inequality with 1, which would result in a different outcome in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff <= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 1, while this replacement checks for less than or equal to 1, which would result in a different outcome in some cases.

DONE.
