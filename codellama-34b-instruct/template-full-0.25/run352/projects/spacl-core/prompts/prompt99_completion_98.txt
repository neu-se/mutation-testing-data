  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called with the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` arguments in a different order than in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is accessed on the result of the `query` method, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx).includes(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method is called on the result of the `query` method with the `path` argument, which would return a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
