  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(point1Rad)` returns the sine of `point1Rad`, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

DONE.
