  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.has
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.has` checks if the policy is present in the map, while `this.get` retrieves the policy from the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.size` returns the number of policies in the map, while `this.get` retrieves a specific policy from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.keys` returns an array of the policy names in the map, while `this.get` retrieves a specific policy from the map.

DONE.
