  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the index variable by 1, which could cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the index variable by 1, which could cause the loop to repeat the same element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index variable, which could cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array or repeat the same element multiple times.

DONE.
