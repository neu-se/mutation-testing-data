  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so the code would execute the `read` function even if `abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression and always returns `true`, so the code would execute the `read` function even if `abort` is false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression and always returns `false`, so the code would never execute the `read` function.

DONE.
