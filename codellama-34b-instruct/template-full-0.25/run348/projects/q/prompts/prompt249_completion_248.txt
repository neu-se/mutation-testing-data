  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` would return the length of the stack trace, which would likely be different from the index of the substring in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.split("\n").length` would return the number of lines in the stack trace, which would likely be different from the index of the substring in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("at")
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.indexOf("at")` would return the index of the first occurrence of the string "at" in the stack trace, which would likely be different from the index of the substring in the original code.

DONE.
