  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2` expects the arguments in the opposite order of `Math.atan`, which could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b) - Math.atan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `b` and `a` separately, which could lead to different results than calculating the arctangent of `b/a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(b/a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the arctangent of `b/a`, which could lead to different results than calculating the arctangent of `b` and `a` separately.

DONE.
