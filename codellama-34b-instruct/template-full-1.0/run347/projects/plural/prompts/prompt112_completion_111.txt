  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
clothes.concat(games).concat(illnesses).concat(misc)
```
This would result in different behavior because `clothes.concat(games).concat(illnesses).concat(misc)` would return a concatenated list of the arrays `clothes`, `games`, `illnesses`, and `misc`, whereas `tools.concat` would return a concatenated list of the arrays `tools` and `games`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
addRule([/wers$/i', /ees$/i'], function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/wers$/i'/preview.hpp.pl` matches words that end with "wers" and has the "i" flag set to ignore case, while the regular expression `/ees$/i'/preview.hpp.pl` matches words that end with
