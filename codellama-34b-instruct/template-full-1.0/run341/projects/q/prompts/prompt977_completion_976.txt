  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer2
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer2` is not defined, and it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of `defer + 1` would be `1`, which is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, and it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
