  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, and it may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a different expression than `a`, and it may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(a)` is a different function than `Math.cos(a)`, and it may have a different value.

DONE.
