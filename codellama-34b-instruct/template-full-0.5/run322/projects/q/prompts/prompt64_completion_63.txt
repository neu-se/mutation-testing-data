  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 1000);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would delay the execution of the `flush` function by 1000 milliseconds, whereas the original code executed it immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would delay the execution of the `flush` function by 0 milliseconds, whereas the original code executed it immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would delay the execution of the `flush` function by -1 milliseconds, which would cause it to execute immediately.

DONE.
