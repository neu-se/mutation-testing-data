  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move to the next element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move to the previous element, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to return the next element without moving to it, potentially causing the iterator to get stuck in an infinite loop.

DONE.
