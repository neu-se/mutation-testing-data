 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` deferred would be immediately rejected, causing the `Queue` to be non-functional. The original code initializes `closed` with a resolved deferred, allowing the queue to operate normally until `close` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` deferred would be initialized with a null resolver, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors when attempting to resolve or reject the deferred. The original code initializes `closed` with a deferred created using `Q.defer()`, ensuring a proper resolver is in place.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer(function () { throw new Error('Buggy resolver') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` deferred would be initialized with a resolver
