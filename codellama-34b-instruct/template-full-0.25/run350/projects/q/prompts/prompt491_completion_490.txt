  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with the `this` context, which could potentially be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function would be called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
