  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would receive `undefined` as the first argument, which could cause it to behave differently than when it receives the actual value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would receive `null` as the first argument, which could cause it to behave differently than when it receives the actual value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `callback` function would receive the string `"foo"` as the first argument, which could cause it to behave differently than when it receives the actual value.

DONE.
