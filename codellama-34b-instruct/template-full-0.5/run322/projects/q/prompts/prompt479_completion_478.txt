  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the wrong element from the `unhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array, which may not be the one that corresponds to the rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at, unhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array, which may not be the one that corresponds to the rejected promise.

DONE.
