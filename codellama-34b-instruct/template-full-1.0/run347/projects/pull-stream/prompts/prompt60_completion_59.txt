  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(abort, done)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function calls `sink.abort` with two arguments, `err` and `cb`, while the replaced code only calls it with one argument, `abort`. This may cause the mutated code to behave differently in certain scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(abort, done || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function calls `sink.abort` with two arguments, `err` and `cb`, while the replaced code only calls it with the first argument, `abort`. Additionally, the replaced code uses a ternary operator to set `cb` to a empty function if it is falsy, which may cause the mutated code to behave differently in certain scenarios.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(abort, cb || function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior
