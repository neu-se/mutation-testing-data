  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback in `Q.nfapply` expects an array as its first argument, but `null` would be passed instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array would be passed as the first argument to `Q.nfapply`, which is not what the function expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an object would be passed as the first argument to `Q.nfapply`, which is not what the function expects.

DONE.
