  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the `===` operator checks for equality. In this case, the code would check if `atReport` is equal to `-1`, which would result in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array is being checked for a length of `0`, which would result in the opposite behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `unhandledRejections` array is being checked for a length of `0`, which would result in the opposite behavior of the original code.

DONE.
