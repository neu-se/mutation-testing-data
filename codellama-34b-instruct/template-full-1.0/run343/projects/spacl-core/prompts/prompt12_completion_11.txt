  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` differs from `match` in that it returns the index of the first match instead of a boolean indicating whether a match was found.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first character of the string, which could affect the result of the `match` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the first character of the string, which could affect the result of the `match` method.

DONE.
