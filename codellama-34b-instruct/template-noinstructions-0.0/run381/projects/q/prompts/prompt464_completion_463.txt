  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an unnecessary `then` handler to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an unnecessary `catch` handler to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an unnecessary `finally` handler to the promise, which could potentially change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
