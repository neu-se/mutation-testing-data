  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, while this modified code fragment adds 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + '2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, while this modified code fragment adds 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds 1 to the imaginary part of the complex number, while this modified code fragment adds the character 'a' to the imaginary part.

DONE.
