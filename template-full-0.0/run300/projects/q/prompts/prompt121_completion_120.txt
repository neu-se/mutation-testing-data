  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would start at the first property of the object, rather than the second.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = "foo";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would start at the property named "foo", rather than the second property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would start at a random property of the object, rather than the second property.

DONE.
