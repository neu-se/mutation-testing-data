  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would no longer add the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would no longer add the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Hello, world!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would add a string value to the `ops` array instead of an operation, causing the code to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
