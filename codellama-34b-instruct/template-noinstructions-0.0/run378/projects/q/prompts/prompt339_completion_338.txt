  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise directly, without checking if it is pending or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason for the rejection, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.state;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise, rather than the value or reason.

DONE.
