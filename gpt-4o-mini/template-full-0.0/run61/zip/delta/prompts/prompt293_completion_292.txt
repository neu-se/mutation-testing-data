Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(iter.next(index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the operations instead of pushing them to the `line`, which would lead to loss of data instead of accumulating it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.push(iter.peek());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing an infinite loop or incorrect accumulation of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(iter.next(index));
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to retain the operations instead of pushing them, which may lead to incorrect handling of the operations and unexpected results in the `line`.

DONE.
