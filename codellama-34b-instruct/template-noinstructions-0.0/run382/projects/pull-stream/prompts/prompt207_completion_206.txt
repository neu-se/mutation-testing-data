  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is called when the `map` function is aborted, but it is not called when the `map` function is completed successfully. In the original code, `cb` is called in both cases, which is the correct behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and cannot be called like a callback. In the original code, `cb` is a function that is called with the result of the `map` function, which is the correct behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and cannot be called like a callback. In the original code, `cb` is a function that is called with the result of the `map` function, which is the correct behavior.

DONE.
