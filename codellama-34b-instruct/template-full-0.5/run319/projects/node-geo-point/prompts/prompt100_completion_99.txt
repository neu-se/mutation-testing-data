  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const latitude = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude would always be set to 0, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const longitude = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude would always be set to 0, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const latitude = longitude;
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude would be set to the same value, regardless of the input coordinates.

DONE.
