  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'], x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the `logHypot` function is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] + x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is taking the sum of `x['re']` and `x['im']`, instead of the product.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re'] * x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is taking the product of `x['re']` and `x['im']`, instead of the sum.

DONE.
