  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\//g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\/` matches a forward slash, and the `g` flag matches all occurrences in the string. Replacing the original `spec` with `spec.replace(/\//g, '')` would result in a mutant that replaces all forward slashes in the path with empty strings, effectively removing all slashes in the path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec, version + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `version` parameter is no longer a valid version string, leading to an error. The mutant would change the version string to a non-existent version, causing the `compile` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\*+/, '+')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `\*+` matches one or more asterisks, and the replacement
