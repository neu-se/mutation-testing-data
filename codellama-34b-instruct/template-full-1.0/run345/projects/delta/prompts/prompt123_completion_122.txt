  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from less than (<) to less than or equal to (<=), which would allow the loop to execute one more time, potentially resulting in an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from greater than (>) to greater than or equal to (>=), which would cause the loop to execute one fewer time, potentially resulting in modified behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index != end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator is changed from less than (<) to not equal (!=), which would allow the loop to execute one more time if end is a negative number, potentially resulting in an infinite loop.

DONE.
