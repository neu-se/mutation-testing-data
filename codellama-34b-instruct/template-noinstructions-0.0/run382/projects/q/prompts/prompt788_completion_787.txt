  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` would pass the value of the promise to the `Q` function, while `null` would pass `null` to the `Q` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` would pass the value of the promise to the `Q` function, while `undefined` would pass `undefined` to the `Q` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `object` would pass the value of the promise to the `Q` function, while `0` would pass `0` to the `Q` function, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
