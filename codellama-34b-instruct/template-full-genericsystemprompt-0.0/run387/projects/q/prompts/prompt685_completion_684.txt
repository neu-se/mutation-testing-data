  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first argument, which is the object on which the method is being invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first two arguments, which are the object on which the method is being invoked and the name of the method being invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would omit the first three arguments, which are the object on which the method is being invoked, the name of the method being invoked, and the arguments passed to the method.

DONE.
