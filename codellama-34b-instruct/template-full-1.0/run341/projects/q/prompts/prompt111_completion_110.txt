  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
collect.bundles
```
This would result in different behavior because "collect.bundles" is not a method of the array "collect" and would result in an error message. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
collect.contains
```
This would result in different behavior because "collect.contains" is not a method of the array "collect" and would result in an error message. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: 
```
collect + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because "collect" is an array variable and "collect + 1" would result in an error message when used as the argument for "array_map".

DONE.
