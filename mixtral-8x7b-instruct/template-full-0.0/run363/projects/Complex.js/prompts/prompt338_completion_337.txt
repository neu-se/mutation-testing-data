 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2, a
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would have a different imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would have a different real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random(), a
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would have a random real part instead of 1, leading to different results in further calculations.

DONE.
