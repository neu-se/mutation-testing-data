  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for 'delete' operations, while this replacement checks for 'retain' operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for 'delete' operations, while this replacement checks for 'insert' operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextType === 'retain' && length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for 'delete' operations, while this replacement checks for 'retain' operations with a non-zero length.

DONE.
