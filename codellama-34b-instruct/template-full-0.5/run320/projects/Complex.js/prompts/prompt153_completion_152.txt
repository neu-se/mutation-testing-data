  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `z['im']` is equal to 0, while the replaced code fragment checks if `z['im']` is not equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `a` is equal to `b`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(c) > Math.abs(d)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `Math.abs(c)` is less than or equal to `Math.abs(d)`, while the replaced code fragment checks if `Math.abs(c)` is greater than `Math.abs(d)`.

DONE.
