  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, causing the `reject` function to be called with the resolved value instead of the `resolve` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, reject, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `resolve` function is being called, which could cause the promise to be resolved multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, resolve, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra `reject` function is being called, which could cause the promise to be rejected multiple times.

DONE.
