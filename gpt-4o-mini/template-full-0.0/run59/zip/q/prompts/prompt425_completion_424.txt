Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect` method as a function, which may lead to a runtime error if `inspect` is not defined as a callable method on the `Promise` prototype.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `state` property directly on the `inspect` method instead of calling it, which would result in `undefined` instead of the expected state value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect().value
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the `value` from the inspected object instead of the `state`, which would incorrectly indicate that the promise is fulfilled regardless of its actual state.

DONE.
