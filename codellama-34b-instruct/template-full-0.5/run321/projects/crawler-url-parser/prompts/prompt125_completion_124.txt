  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.includes("://")
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.includes("://")` will always return `true` if `linkurl` contains the substring "://", regardless of its type, whereas `typeof linkurl == "string"` only returns `true` if `linkurl` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.length > 0` will always return `true` if `linkurl` has a length greater than 0, regardless of its type, whereas `typeof linkurl == "string"` only returns `true` if `linkurl` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.indexOf("://") > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `linkurl.indexOf("://") > -1` will always return `true` if `linkurl` contains the substring "://
