  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `self.promiseDispatch` is a method that dispatches the operation to the promise, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `callback` is a function that is called with the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
