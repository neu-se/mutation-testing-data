  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would allow the loop to continue even if the next operation is a delete, which could lead to an infinite loop. By adding the check for the peek type, we ensure that the loop only continues if the next operation is not a delete.
