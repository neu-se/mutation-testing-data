  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(data.countries)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values in the object, whereas `Object.keys` returns an array of the keys in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(data.countries).map(id => data.countries[id])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method to retrieve the country objects from the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(data.countries).map(([key, value]) => value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method to retrieve the country objects from the object and it also uses the `map` function, which processes each element of an array and return a new array with the results.

DONE.
