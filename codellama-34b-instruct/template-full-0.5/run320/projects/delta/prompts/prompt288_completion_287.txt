  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete()` would delete the entire line, while `line.push()` would push the next operation onto the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain(otherOp)` would retain the entire line, while `line.push()` would push the next operation onto the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.insert(otherOp)` would insert the next operation onto the line, while `line.push()` would push the next operation onto the line.

DONE.
