  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the value of `i` instead of increasing it, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the value of `i` by 2 instead of 1, which would cause the loop to skip over certain elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = Math.floor(i/2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `i` to its halved value instead of increasing it, which would cause the loop to terminate prematurely.

DONE.
