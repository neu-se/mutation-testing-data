  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the name of the policy, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the uppercase version of the policy name, rather than the policy object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the map to the policy name with the characters reversed, rather than the policy object itself.

DONE.
