  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the line would be increased by 1, which would cause the `indexOf` method to return a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the line would be decreased by 1, which would cause the `indexOf` method to return a different index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the line would be doubled, which would cause the `indexOf` method to return a different index.

DONE.
