  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would notify the promise of new progress, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.cancel, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.cancel` would cancel the promise, whereas `deferred.resolve` would resolve it.

DONE.
