  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(1)` would return the next operation in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next(2)` would return the next two operations in the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

DONE.
