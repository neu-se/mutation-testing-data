  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterias')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while this modified code fragment adds the plural form as "criterias".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterions')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while this modified code fragment adds the plural form as "criterions".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterion')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the plural form of "criterion" as "criteria", while this modified code fragment does not add a plural form.

DONE.
