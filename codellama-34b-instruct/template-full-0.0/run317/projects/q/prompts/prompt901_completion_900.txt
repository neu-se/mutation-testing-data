  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a node-style callback, which is then used to reject the promise. In contrast, the modified code fragment simply calls `deferred.reject()` with the error object, which would result in the promise being rejected with the error object directly, rather than being rejected with a node-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
