  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 1)` to remove the last character of the word, while the new code fragment uses `w.substr(0, w.length - 2)` to remove the last two characters of the word. This would cause the plural form of words ending in "y" to be incorrect.

DONE.
