 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function makeStackTraceLong() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a function that does nothing, instead of forwarding the error to a future turn and throwing it as an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error("Timed out after " + ms + " ms");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws the error immediately, instead of scheduling it to be thrown in a future turn.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.onerror(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the global `Q.onerror` function, if it exists, instead of throwing the error as an exception or forwarding it to a future turn.

DONE.
