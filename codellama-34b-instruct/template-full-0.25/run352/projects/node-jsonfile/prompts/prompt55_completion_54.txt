  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now being used as an object instead of a function, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now being used as a string instead of a function, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now being used as an array instead of a function, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
