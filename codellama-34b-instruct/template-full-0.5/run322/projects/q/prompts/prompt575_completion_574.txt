  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function, but the `continuer` function would not be called with the `"next"` argument, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function, but the `continuer` function would be called with the `"throw"` argument, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on the `continuer` function, but the `continuer` function would be called with the `"error"`
