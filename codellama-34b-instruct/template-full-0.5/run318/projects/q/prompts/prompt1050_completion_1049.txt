  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.resolve` is used to resolve the promise, while `ends.reject` is used to reject the promise. This would cause the `get` method to fail with an error, even if there is a value in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise` is a promise, and `resolve` is a method of the promise. This would cause the `get` method to resolve the promise with the value, even if there is no value in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `ends.promise` is a promise, and `reject` is a method of the promise. This would cause the `get` method to reject the promise with an error, even if there is a value in the queue
