  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.ops` is a different object than `thisIter.rest`, and may contain different attributes or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest` is a different object than `thisIter.rest`, and may contain different attributes or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Delta()` is a new, empty Delta object, which may not have the same attributes or methods as the original `thisIter.rest` object.

DONE.
