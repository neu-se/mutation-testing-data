  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the value of `s.sink`, which is a function that reads from a stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `sink` property of `s` to `null`, which would prevent the function from reading from the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink = function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `sink` property of `s` to a function that returns `null`, which would cause the function to always return `null` instead of reading from the stream.

DONE.
