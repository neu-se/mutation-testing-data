  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = /* void */
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/* void */` comment would cause the next line to be treated as a comment, resulting in a different value for `z['im']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` value would cause the next line to be treated as a comment, resulting in a different value for `z['im']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] = NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NaN` value would cause the next line to be treated as a comment, resulting in a different value for `z['im']`.

DONE.
