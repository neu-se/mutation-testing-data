  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra 's' to the end of the word, which would cause the plural function to return an incorrect plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word, which would cause the plural function to return an incorrect plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the 's' from the end of the word, which would cause the plural function to return an incorrect plural form.

DONE.
