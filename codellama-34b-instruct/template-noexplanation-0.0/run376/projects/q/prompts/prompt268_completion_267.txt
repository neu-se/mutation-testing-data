  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error(reason))
```
This change will cause the `reject` method to be called with a new `Error` object, which will have a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(reason + "!")
```
This change will cause the `reject` method to be called with a string that is the concatenation of the `reason` string and the string "!". This will have a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(null)
```
This change will cause the `reject` method to be called with a `null` value, which will have a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
