  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to return a `GeoPoint` with a precision that is one decimal place higher than the input precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to return a `GeoPoint` with a precision that is one decimal place lower than the input precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
precision * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to return a `GeoPoint` with a precision that is twice the input precision.

DONE.
