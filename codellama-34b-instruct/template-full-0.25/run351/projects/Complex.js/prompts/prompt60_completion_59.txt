  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `phi` property is not defined in the `a` object, and would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abs` property is not defined in the `a` object, and would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` property is not defined in the `a` object, and would return `undefined`.

DONE.
