  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the variable representing the real part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the variable representing the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `b`, and would cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `c[0]` is the first element of the array `c`, whereas `b` is a variable representing the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
