  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` on `arguments` starting from index 1, whereas the original code called `array_slice` on `arguments` starting from index 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` on `arguments` starting from index 2, whereas the original code called `array_slice` on `arguments` starting from index 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `array_slice` on `arguments` starting from index 3, whereas the original code called `array_slice` on `arguments` starting from index 1.

DONE.
