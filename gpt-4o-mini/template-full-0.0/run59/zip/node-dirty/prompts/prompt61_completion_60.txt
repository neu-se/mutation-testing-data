Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` will finish writing to the stream and close it, but it does not destroy the stream immediately, potentially leading to resource leaks if there are still pending operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pause()` will stop the flow of data from the stream, but it does not close or destroy the stream, which may lead to the application hanging if it expects the stream to be closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because `close()` is not a valid method for a readable stream in Node.js, which would throw an error, unlike `destroy()` that properly handles the stream's lifecycle.

DONE.
