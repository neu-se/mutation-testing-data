Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp = iter.next(end - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly retrieves one extra operation than intended, potentially leading to an off-by-one error in the resulting `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `null` value to the `ops` array instead of the actual operation, which could cause issues when processing the `ops` later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.push(nextOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `attributes` of `nextOp` instead of the `nextOp` itself, which would lead to an array of attributes rather than an array of operations.

DONE.
