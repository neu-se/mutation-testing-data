  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `a` to be a non-object value, which would cause the `throw` statement to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `a` to be `null`, which would cause the `throw` statement to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `a` to be `undefined`, which would cause the `throw` statement to be skipped.

DONE.
