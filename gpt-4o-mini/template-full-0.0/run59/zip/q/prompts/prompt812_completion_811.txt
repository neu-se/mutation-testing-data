Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.call()` does not pass the context of `callback` to the function, which may lead to unexpected results if `callback` relies on its context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because using `bind(this)` would change the context of `callback.fcall`, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if `callback.fcall` expects a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.fcall.apply(null)` does not provide the correct context for `callback`, which may cause it to behave incorrectly if it relies on `this` being set to the `callback` object.

DONE.
