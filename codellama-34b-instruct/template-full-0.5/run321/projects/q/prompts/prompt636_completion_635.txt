  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method that rejects the promise with a reason, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a method that resolves the promise with a value, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that adds a fulfillment handler to the promise, whereas `dispatch` is a method that dispatches a message to a promise.

DONE.
