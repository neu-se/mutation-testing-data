  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `error` would throw an error if `closed.promise` is not resolved, while the new code fragment `null` would not throw an error and would instead return a resolved promise with value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `error` would throw an error if `closed.promise` is not resolved, while the new code fragment `undefined` would not throw an error and would instead return a resolved promise with value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `error` would throw an error if `closed.promise` is not resolved, while the new code fragment `Q.reject(new Error("Can't get value from closed queue"))` would return
