  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `args` parameter `null`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `args` parameter `undefined`, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `args` parameter an empty array, which would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to get invoked with the `array` property of `undefined`.

DONE.
