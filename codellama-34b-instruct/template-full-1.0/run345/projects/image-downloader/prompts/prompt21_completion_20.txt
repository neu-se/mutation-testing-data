  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object is a different type than `options.dest`, which is a string. The `path.isAbsolute()` method expects a string argument, so passing in the `options` object would result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace('\\', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would modify the `options.dest` string by removing any backslashes. This could change the behavior of the `path.isAbsolute()` method, which expects a string with no backslashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute()` method expects a string argument, and passing in `null` would result in an error.

DONE.
