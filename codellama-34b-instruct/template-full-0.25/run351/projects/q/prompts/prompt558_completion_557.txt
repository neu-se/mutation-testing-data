  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is being modified, which could potentially change the outcome of the `verb` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is being modified, which could potentially change the outcome of the `verb` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arg` variable is being modified, which could potentially change the outcome of the `verb` method.

DONE.
