Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from an empty array to an array containing a `null` value, which may lead to unexpected results when the method is invoked, as it alters the expected input for the dispatch function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"getKeys", []
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the method name from `"keys"` to `"getKeys"`, which likely does not exist in the context of the dispatch function, leading to a failure in finding the appropriate method to invoke.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument from an empty array to an array with numeric values, which could cause the dispatch function to behave incorrectly if it expects a different structure or type of arguments.

DONE.
