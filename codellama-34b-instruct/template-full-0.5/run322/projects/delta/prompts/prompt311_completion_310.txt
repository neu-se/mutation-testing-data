  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the second element instead of the first, and the predicate would be applied to every other element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the previous element instead of the current one, and the predicate would be applied to every other element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the doubled element instead of the current one, and the predicate would be applied to every other element.

DONE.
