  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a function that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the value of the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that returns a promise that is rejected with the specified reason, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the value of the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object, which can be used to create a promise that is resolved or rejected manually, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise that resolves with the value of the first argument.

DONE.
