  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getCountryForTimezone` would return a random country instead of the country associated with the given timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName + "random string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getCountryForTimezone` would return a country with a name that is a concatenation of the given timezone name and a random string, which may not exist in the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName).name
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `getCountryForTimezone` would return a country with a name that is the name of the timezone passed as an argument, instead of the country associated with the given timezone.

DONE.
