  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the same as the cosine of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the cosine of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the cosine of the difference between the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which is not the same as the cosine of the real part.

DONE.
