  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an array of the map's values, rather than a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` removes a key-value pair from the map, rather than returning a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, "replacement value")
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` adds or updates a key-value pair in the map, rather than returning a value.

DONE.
