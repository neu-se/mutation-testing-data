  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the longitude is less than -180 or greater than 180, while the new code fragment checks if the longitude is less than or equal to -180 or greater than or equal to 180. This would allow for a wider range of longitude values to be considered valid, potentially leading to different behavior in the application.

DONE.
