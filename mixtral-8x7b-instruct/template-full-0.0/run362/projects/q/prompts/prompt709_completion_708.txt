 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function will no longer consider any arguments passed to it, as an empty array will always be used as the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the arguments of the `fbound` function itself, rather than the arguments passed to the function being bound.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globalArguments
```
Assuming `globalArguments` is not defined, this would result in a ReferenceError, which is different from the original behavior.

DONE.
