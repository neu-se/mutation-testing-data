  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because if currentUrl is falsy, it will always return currentUrl.url, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl ? currentUrl.url : null
```
This would result in different behavior because if currentUrl is falsy, it will always return null, regardless of the value of currentUrl.url.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.host ? currentUrl.url : null
```
This would result in different behavior because if currentUrl.host is falsy, it will always return null, regardless of the value of currentUrl.url.

DONE.
