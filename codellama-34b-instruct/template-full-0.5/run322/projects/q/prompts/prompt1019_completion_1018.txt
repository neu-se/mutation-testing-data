  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would be called on `this.dispatch` instead of `this`, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(null, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would be called on `this.dispatch` with `null` as the `this` value, which would likely cause a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(null, arguments)()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would be called on `this.dispatch` with `null` as the `this` value, and the resulting function would be called immediately, which would likely cause a type error.

DONE.
