Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of `aborted` would cause the callback to be invoked with `null`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the abort state in the calling code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `true` instead of `aborted` would indicate that the operation was successful, which contradicts the intended behavior of signaling that an abort has occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Aborted')
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a new error object instead of the `aborted` value would change the type of the response, leading to different error handling logic in the callback, which may not properly reflect the original abort condition.

DONE.
