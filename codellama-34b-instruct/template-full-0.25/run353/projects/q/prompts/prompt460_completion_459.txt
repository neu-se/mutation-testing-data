  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at !== -1 && unhandledReasons[at] === reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove the rejection from the `unhandledReasons` array if the reason matches the one stored at the index `at`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at !== -1 && unhandledRejections[at] === promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove the rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array if the promise matches the one stored at the index `at`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at !== -1 && unhandledReasons[at] === reason && unhandledRejections[at] === promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only remove the rejection from the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays if both the reason and the promise match the ones stored at the index `at`.
