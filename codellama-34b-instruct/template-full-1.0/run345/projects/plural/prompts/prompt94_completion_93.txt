  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not pointing to the correct string pattern, which could result in false positives or no matches at all.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the "g" flag at the end of the regular expression enables global matching mode, which would match all occurrences of the string "man" rather than just the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?woman$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is specifically looking for the string "woman" rather than just "man," which would result in a different set of matches.

DONE.
