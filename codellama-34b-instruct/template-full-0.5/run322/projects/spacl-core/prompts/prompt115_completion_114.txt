  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deny` method to modify the `verbs` object, which is not intended. The `deny` method is intended to mark verbs as denied, but it should not modify the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with a copy of the `verbs` object, but it would not modify the original `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array with a copy of the `verbs` object, but it would also modify the original `verbs` object.

DONE.
