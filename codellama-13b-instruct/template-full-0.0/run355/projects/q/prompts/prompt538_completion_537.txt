  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to return a promise for the `all` method of the `Promise` object, rather than the `spread` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.spread
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to return a promise for the `spread` method of the `Promise` object, rather than the `all` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `spread` function to return a promise for the `then` method of the `Promise` object, rather than the `spread` or `all` method.

DONE.
