  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called twice, which could cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a `force` parameter set to `true`, which could cause the archive to be finalized even if it is not ready.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a `force` parameter set to `false`, which could cause the archive to not be finalized if it is not ready.

DONE.
