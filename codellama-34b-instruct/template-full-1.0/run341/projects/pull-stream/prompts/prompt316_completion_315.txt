  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a different value than the original code. In the original code, `cb` is called with `ended`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In the mutated code, `cb` is called with `null`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a different value than the original code. In the original code, `cb` is called with `ended`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In the mutated code, `cb` is called with `undefined`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
last ? terminate(cb) : cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because
