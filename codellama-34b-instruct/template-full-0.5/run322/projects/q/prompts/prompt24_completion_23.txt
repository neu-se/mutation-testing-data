  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a conditional expression that checks if the variable `domain` is truthy, while the replacement code fragment is a constant value of 0, which is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a conditional expression that checks if the variable `domain` is truthy, while the replacement code fragment is a constant value of null, which is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a conditional expression that checks if the variable `domain` is truthy, while the replacement code fragment is a constant value of undefined, which is falsy.

DONE.
