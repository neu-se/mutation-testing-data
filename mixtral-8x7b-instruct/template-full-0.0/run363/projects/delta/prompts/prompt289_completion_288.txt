 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always takes the first character of the next operation, instead of the whole operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it looks at the previous operation instead of the next one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
iter.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the first operation in the iterator, instead of the next one.

DONE.
