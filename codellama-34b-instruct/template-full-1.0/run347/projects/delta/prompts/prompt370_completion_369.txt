  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the next delta op instead of retaining it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one more element than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()) - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain one less element than the original code fragment.

DONE.
