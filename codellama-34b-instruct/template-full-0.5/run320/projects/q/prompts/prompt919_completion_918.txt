  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `deferred` object as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this modified code fragment passes `null`. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `deferred` object as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this modified code fragment passes the `deferred` object as an argument to itself. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `deferred` object as an argument to `makeNodeResolver`, while this modified code fragment passes a new function that
