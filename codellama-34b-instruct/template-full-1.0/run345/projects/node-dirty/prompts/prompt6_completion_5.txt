  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the entire key-value pair from the map, instead of just the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to 0 instead of a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val, () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value to an empty function instead of a non-empty function.

DONE.
