  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from a map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a new value for a key or adds a new key-value pair if the key does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all key-value pairs from a map, whereas `set` and `delete` only affect a single key-value pair.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(row.key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to `undefined`, whereas the original code sets the value to `row.val`.

DONE.
