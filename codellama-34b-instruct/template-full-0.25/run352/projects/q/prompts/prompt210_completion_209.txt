  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `length` property, unlike `arguments`, which is an array-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array and does not have any elements, unlike `arguments`, which is an array-like object that contains the arguments passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a string and does not have a `length` property, unlike `arguments`, which is an array-like object.

DONE.
