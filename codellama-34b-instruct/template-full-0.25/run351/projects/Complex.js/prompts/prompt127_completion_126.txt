  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` even if `z` is not infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` only if both `this` and `z` are infinite, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` if `z` is zero, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
