  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `array` is not an array, while the new code checks if it is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `array` is not an array, while the new code checks if its length is 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `array` is not an array, while the new code checks if its length is 0 or negative.

DONE.
