  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` always calls the callback with `promise` as the first argument, whereas `fcall` only calls the callback with `promise` as the first argument if the callback is a method of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` always calls the callback with `promise` as the first argument, whereas `fcall` only calls the callback with `promise` as the first argument if the callback is a method of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(callback.fcall(promise), function () {
    throw new Error("Q can't apply callback");
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it always throws an error if `callback.fcall(promise)` resolves with a value, whereas the original code
