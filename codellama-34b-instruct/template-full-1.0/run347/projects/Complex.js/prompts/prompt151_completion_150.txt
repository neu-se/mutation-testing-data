  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](z['isInfinite'] < z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is never called with a argument, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not correctly called with the `z` variable, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']() < z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is called with the `z` variable, which would cause an error.

DONE.
