  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d2r(point2.longitude) - d2r(point1.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle between the two points would be calculated in radians, rather than degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle between the two points would be calculated in degrees, rather than radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * (360 / 2 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the angle between the two points would be calculated using a different formula, which would result in a different value.

DONE.
