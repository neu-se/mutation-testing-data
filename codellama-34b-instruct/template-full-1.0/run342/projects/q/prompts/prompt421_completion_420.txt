  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the original condition, causing the `then` branch to be evaluated when the object is not a promise, as opposed to the original code where the `then` branch is evaluated when the object is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the object is a promise or has a `then` method, as opposed to the original code that checks if the object is a promise. This would cause the `then` branch to be evaluated for objects that are not promises but have a `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate the `then` branch if the object is not in the pending state, whereas the original code evaluates the `then` branch if the
