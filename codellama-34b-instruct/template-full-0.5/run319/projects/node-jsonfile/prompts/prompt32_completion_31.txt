  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, options.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj, options` passes two arguments to the `stringify` function, while the modified code fragment `obj, options.toString()` passes only one argument, which is the result of calling `toString()` on the `options` object. This could cause the `stringify` function to behave differently, potentially leading to a failure in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj, options` passes two arguments to the `stringify` function, while the modified code fragment `obj, null` passes only one argument, which is `null`. This could cause the `stringify` function to behave differently, potentially leading to a failure in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj, options` passes two arguments to the
