  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== "Null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator is used to check if a value is of a certain type, while the equality operator is used to compare two values for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because "Null" is a string, while null is a keyword.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the typeof operator is used to check if a value is of a certain type, while the equality operator is used to compare two values for equality.

DONE.
