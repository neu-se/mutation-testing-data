  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would not be called with the correct `this` context, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would not be called with the expected `this` context, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick.apply(window, [flush])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function would not be called with the correct `this` context, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
