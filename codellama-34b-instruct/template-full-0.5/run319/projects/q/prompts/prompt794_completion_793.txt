  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and using it as a callback function would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `null`, rather than the original value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and using it as a callback function would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `undefined`, rather than the original value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid value in JavaScript, and using it as a callback function would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value of `0`, rather than the original value of the promise.

DONE.
