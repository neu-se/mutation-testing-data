 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function wrapper around the `cb` callback, which could affect how `cb` is invoked or what value it receives as its `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `this` context of the `cb` callback, which could affect how `cb` accesses variables in its parent scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it invokes the `reducer` function with `cb` as the second argument instead of the data received from the source. This could cause the `reducer` to produce incorrect results or throw an error.

DONE.
