  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the error argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the error and data arguments. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting both arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the error argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with the aborted argument. This could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the aborted argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback function with the error argument, while this code fragment calls the callback function with both the error and data arguments.

DONE.
