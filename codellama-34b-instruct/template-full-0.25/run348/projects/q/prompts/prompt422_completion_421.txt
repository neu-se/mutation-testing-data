  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the truthiness of the object, so if the object is truthy, the negated object would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` is a method that returns the primitive value of the object, which can be different from the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` is a method that returns a string representation of the object, which can be different from the object itself.

DONE.
