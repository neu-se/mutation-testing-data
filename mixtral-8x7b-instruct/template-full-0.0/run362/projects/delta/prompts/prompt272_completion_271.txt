 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek() !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, and checking for `null` would always be false since operation objects are never `null`. The original code checks if there is a next operation using `hasNext()`, which is the correct way to check if there are more operations to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peek() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` never returns `undefined`, so this condition would always be true if `hasNext()` is true. The original code checks if there is a next operation using `hasNext()`, which is sufficient to determine if there are more operations to iterate over.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()
