  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback if `cb` is truthy, while this new code fragment always calls the callback with `end` as an argument, regardless of whether `cb` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with `null` as an argument, while this new code fragment always calls the callback with the result of `generate()` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with `end` as an argument, while this new code fragment always calls the callback with both `end` and the result of `generate()` as arguments.

DONE.
