  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication would be applied to the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable, which could potentially result in a different value being returned by the `Math.cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication would be applied in a different order, which could potentially result in a different value being returned by the `Math.cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable would be squared before being passed to the `Math.sqrt` function, which could potentially result in a different value being returned by the `Math.cos` function.

DONE.
