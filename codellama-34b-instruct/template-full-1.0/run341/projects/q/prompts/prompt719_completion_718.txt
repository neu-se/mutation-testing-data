  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is not a valid property of the Promise.prototype object, whereas "keys" is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", [42]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array with a single element (42) is not the same as an empty array ([]) passed as an argument to the dispatch method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys", null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not the same as an empty array passed as an argument to the dispatch method.

DONE.
