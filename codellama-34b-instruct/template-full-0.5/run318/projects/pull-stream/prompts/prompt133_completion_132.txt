  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so if `cb` is truthy, `!cb` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `cb`, which could potentially change its behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would convert the value of `cb` to a string, which could potentially change its behavior.

DONE.
