  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` except the first one, whereas `args` would return the original array. This could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments and potentially produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.concat([1])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat([1])` would return a new array containing all elements of `args` followed by the value `1`, whereas `args` would return the original array. This could cause the `promiseDispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments and potentially produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.map(function(x) { return x + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map(function(x
