  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, while `exception` is an object, and the `isStopIteration` function is checking if the input is an instance of `QReturnValue`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.prototype` is an object, while `exception` is an instance of `QReturnValue`, and the `isStopIteration` function is checking if the input is an instance of `QReturnValue`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.constructor` is a function, while `exception` is an instance of `QReturnValue`, and the `isStopIteration` function is checking if the input is an instance of `QReturnValue`.

DONE.
