  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` in the URL with an empty string, while the new code fragment would replace all occurrences of `#` with an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' #'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` in the URL with an empty string, while the new code fragment would replace all occurrences of `#` with an empty string, and then add a space and another `#` to the end of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + ' ' + '#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the first occurrence of `#` in the URL with an empty string, while the new code fragment would replace all occurrences of `#` with an empty string, and then add a space and another `#` to the end
