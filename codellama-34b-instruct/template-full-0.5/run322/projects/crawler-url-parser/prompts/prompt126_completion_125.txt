  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL is not taken into account when parsing the URL, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` argument tells the `parse` function to parse the URL as a relative URL, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL is not actually relative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument tells the `parse` function to parse the URL as an absolute URL, which could lead to incorrect results if the URL is actually relative.

DONE.
