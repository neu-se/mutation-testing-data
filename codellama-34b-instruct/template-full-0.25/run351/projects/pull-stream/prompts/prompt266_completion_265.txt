  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `if (err === true)` check to fail, leading to different execution paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `if (err === true)` check to fail, leading to different execution paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` is not the same as `data`, and it would cause the `if (err === true)` check to fail, leading to different execution paths.

DONE.
