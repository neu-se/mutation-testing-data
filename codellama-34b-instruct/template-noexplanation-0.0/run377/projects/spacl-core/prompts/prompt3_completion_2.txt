  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/g
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the `g` flag to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/i
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the `i` flag to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/m
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds the `m` flag to the regular expression, which makes it match multiple lines.

DONE.
