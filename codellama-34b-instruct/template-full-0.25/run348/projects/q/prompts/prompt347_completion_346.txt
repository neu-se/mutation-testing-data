  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

rejected === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `undefined` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return `"function"` for `rejected` and `"undefined"` for `undefined`, causing the conditional to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and `null` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return `"function"` for `rejected` and `"object"` for `null`, causing the conditional to evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function, and the string `"function"` is not a function, so the `typeof` operator would return `"function
