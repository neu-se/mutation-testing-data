  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.extname()` function returns the extension of a file path, while the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` property is a file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.isAbsolute(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.isAbsolute()` function checks if a file path is absolute, while the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` property is an absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path.dirname()` function returns the directory name of a file path, while the original code fragment checks if the `options.dest` property is a directory path.

DONE.
