  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `ops` is an array, regardless of its length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `ops` is an array, regardless of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` if `ops` is an array with only one element.

DONE.
