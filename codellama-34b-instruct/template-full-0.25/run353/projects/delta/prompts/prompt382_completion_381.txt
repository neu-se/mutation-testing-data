  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the entire `other` delta onto the `delta` array, rather than just the next `length` elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(<PLACEHOLDER>));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next `length` elements of the `other` delta onto the `delta` array, but it would not push the entire `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next(length + 1));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next `length + 1` elements of the `other` delta onto the `delta` array, rather than just the next `length` elements.

DONE.
