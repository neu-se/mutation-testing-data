  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would not be called, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with a `null` argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` function would be called with a different function argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
