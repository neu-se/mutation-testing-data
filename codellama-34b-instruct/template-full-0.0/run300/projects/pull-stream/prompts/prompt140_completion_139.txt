  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function if `end` is truthy, while this modified code fragment calls `cb` unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes `null` as the first argument to `cb`, while this modified code fragment passes the result of `generate()` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the result of `generate()` as the second argument to `cb`, while this modified code fragment passes the result of `generate() + 1` as the second argument.

DONE.
