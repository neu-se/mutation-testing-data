Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence|fruit)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds "fruit" to the list of uncountable nouns, which would incorrectly allow "fruit" to be treated as uncountable, while the original code did not include it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because changing the regex flag from 'i' (case insensitive) to 'g' (global) would cause the regex to behave differently, potentially matching multiple occurrences in a string rather than just checking for a single match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|
