  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be invoked on `undefined` instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be invoked on `null` instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would be invoked on the number `0` instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, causing an error.

DONE.
