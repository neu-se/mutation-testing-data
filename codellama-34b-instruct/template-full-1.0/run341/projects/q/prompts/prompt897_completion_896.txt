  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"DONE";
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that the `deferred.reject` function is called with the string `"DONE"` as an argument, which would have different effects than passing the `error` object as an argument.
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.message;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `error.message` property instead of `error` directly, which would have different effects.
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(error.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new error object with the same `message` property as the `error` object, which would have different effects than passing the `error` object directly.

DONE.
