  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `aborted` was truthy, but replacing it with `true` would make the code return a hardcoded truthy value even if `aborted` is actually falsey.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `aborted` was truthy, but replacing it with `null` would make the code return a hardcoded falsey value even if `aborted` is actually truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if `aborted` was truthy, but replacing it with `!aborted` would make the code check if `aborted` was falsy, which could cause the code to behave differently in some cases.

DONE.
