  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestTick` is a different function than `requestPortTick`, and it would be called with a different context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setImmediate(flush)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a different function than `requestPortTick`, and it would be called with a different context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a different function than `requestPortTick`, and it would be called with a different context.

DONE.
