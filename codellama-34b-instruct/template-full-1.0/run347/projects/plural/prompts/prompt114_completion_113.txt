  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` object is no longer used, so the code would likely error out.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"puzzles"
```
This would result in different behavior because the array of games would be replaced with an array of puzzles, which would affect the behavior of the `plural` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the array of games would be replaced with a random number between 0 and 9, which would likely cause the `plural` function to error out.

DONE.
