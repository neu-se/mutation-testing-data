Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the callback to `true`, which may indicate a successful operation instead of the expected `null`, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` for both arguments of the callback, which may cause the consumer of the callback to misinterpret the result as an error or an empty response, rather than the actual data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments, passing the data as the first argument and `null` as the second, which could confuse the callback's expected error-first convention and lead to incorrect processing of the data.

DONE.
