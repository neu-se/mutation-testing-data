  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with the global object as its context, rather than the `process` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(process)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with the `process` object as its context, rather than the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onUnhandledError` would be called with `undefined` as its context, rather than the global or `process` object.

DONE.
