  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes and returns the last element of the array, whereas `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes and returns the first element of the array, whereas `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.splice(0, unhandledReasons.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes and returns a portion of the array, whereas `slice()` returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.

DONE.
