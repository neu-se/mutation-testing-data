  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?ma$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the string "ma" instead of "man" or "woman".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the string "man" or "woman" multiple times instead of just once.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match the string "man" or "woman" case-insensitively instead of case-sensitively.

DONE.
