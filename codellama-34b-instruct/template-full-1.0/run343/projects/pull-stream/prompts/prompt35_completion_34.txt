  Sure, here are three potential buggy code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is accessed at index 0 instead of index 1, which could cause a different value to be used in the `pull` function's return statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is accessed at index 2 instead of index 1, which could cause a different value to be used in the `pull` function's return statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value at `ref[1]` is incremented by 1 before being used in the `pull` function's return statement.

DONE.
