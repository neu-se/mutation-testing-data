  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the number is zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation of `isInfinite` would check if the number is not infinite, while the original code fragment checks if the number is infinite.

DONE.
