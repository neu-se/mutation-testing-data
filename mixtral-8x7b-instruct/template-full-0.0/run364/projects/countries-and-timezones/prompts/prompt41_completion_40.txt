 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is falsy, it will return an empty object instead of the original behavior of skipping that key-value pair in the resulting object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is falsy, it will omit that key-value pair in the resulting object, whereas the original code would still include it with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev ? { ...prev, [id]: getCountry(id, options) } : { [id]: getCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because if `prev` is truthy, it will create a new object with the spread operator, whereas the original code would use `Object.assign()` to copy the properties from `prev` to the new object.

DONE.
