  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace(/[^\w\d]/g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any non-word and non-digit characters from the `options.dest` string, which could potentially change the file path being used for the download.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last segment of the `options.dest` string, which could potentially change the file name being used for the download.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the directory name of the `options.dest` string, which could potentially change the file path being used for the download.

DONE.
