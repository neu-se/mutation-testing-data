  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would no longer be called when an error occurs, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { throw new Error("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would now throw an error whenever it is called, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () { console.log("Q.onerror called"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.onerror` function would now log a message to the console whenever it is called, which could cause the program to behave differently or produce different output.

DONE.
