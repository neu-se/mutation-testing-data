  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest()` returns the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas `rest` is not a valid method for the `OpIterator` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.rest()` returns the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas `rest` is not a valid method for the `OpIterator` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta(thisIter.rest())
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Delta(thisIter.rest())` creates a new `Delta` object with the remaining ops in the iterator, whereas `rest` is not a valid method for the `OpIterator` class.

DONE.
