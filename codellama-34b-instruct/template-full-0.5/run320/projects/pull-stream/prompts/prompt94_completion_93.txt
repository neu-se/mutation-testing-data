  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, while `undefined` is not. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `undefined`, the test will fail because the function expects a valid value, not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "not a number". If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `NaN`, the test will fail because the function expects a numeric value, not `NaN`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `null` is a valid value, while `"foo"` is not. If the PLACEHOLDER is replaced with `"foo"`, the test will fail because the function expects a valid value, not a string.

DONE.
