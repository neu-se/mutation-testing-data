  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array, while `reverse` is a method that reverses the order of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array, while `slice` is a method that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.concat(parts)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` is a method that applies a function to each element of an array, while `concat` is a method that combines two or more arrays.

DONE.
