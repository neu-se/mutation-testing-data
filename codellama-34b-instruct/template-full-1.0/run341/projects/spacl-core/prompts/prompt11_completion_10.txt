  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `==` operator checks for equality, while the `!==` operator checks for inequality. In this case, the `!==` operator is used to check if the regex match is not null, so replacing it with `== null` would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, while the `!== undefined` operator checks for undefined values. In this case, the `!==` operator is used to check if the regex match is not null, so replacing it with `!== undefined` would change the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[^/]:|:\/|:$/) == 'something'
```
