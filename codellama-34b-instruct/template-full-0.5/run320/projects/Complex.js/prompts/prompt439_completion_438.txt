  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of the multiplication, which would change the final value of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the result of the multiplication by 2, which would change the final value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * places - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of the multiplication, which would change the final value of the complex number.

DONE.
