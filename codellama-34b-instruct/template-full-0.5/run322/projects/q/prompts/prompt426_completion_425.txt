  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, causing the function to return `true` for fulfilled promises instead of rejected ones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is not rejected instead of fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
