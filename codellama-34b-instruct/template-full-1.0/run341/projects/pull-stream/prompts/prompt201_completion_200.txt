  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code that calls `cb` with `aborted` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with `data` as the first argument, which is not the same as the original code that calls `cb` with `data` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `busy` variable to `false`, which means that the code inside the `if` statement would not be executed, even if `busy` was previously set to `true`.

DONE.
