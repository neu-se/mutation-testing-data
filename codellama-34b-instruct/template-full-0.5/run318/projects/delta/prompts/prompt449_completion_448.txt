  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while the modified code checks if it is not a number. This would cause the `else` block to be executed in the modified code, even if `op.delete` is a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while the modified code checks if it is a string. This would cause the `else` block to be executed in the modified code, even if `op.delete` is a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.delete === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.delete` is a number, while the modified code
