  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '+'
```
This modification will cause the parser to treat the plus sign as a whitespace character, which may cause issues with parsing complex numbers that contain a plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === 'i'
```
This modification will cause the parser to treat the letter "i" as a whitespace character, which may cause issues with parsing complex numbers that contain the imaginary unit.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === 'e'
```
This modification will cause the parser to treat the letter "e" as a whitespace character, which may cause issues with parsing complex numbers that contain the exponential notation.

DONE.
