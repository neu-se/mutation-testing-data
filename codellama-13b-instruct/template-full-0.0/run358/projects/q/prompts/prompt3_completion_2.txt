  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the buggy code fragment is a variable reference. This could cause the code to behave differently if the variable is not defined or has a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
