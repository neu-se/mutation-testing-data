  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with an additional argument, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called with a different value, which would cause the `drain` event to be emitted with a different value.

DONE.
