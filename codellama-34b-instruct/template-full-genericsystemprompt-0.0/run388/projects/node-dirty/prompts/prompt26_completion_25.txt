  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with a null error, while this modified code fragment would call the callback with a dummy error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null, 'dummy data');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with a null error and no data, while this modified code fragment would call the callback with a null error and the string 'dummy data'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Dummy error'), 'dummy data');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would call the callback with a null error and no data, while this modified code fragment would call the callback with a dummy error and the string 'dummy data'.

DONE.
