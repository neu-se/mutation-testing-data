  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function returns the smallest of its two arguments, whereas `length - 1` returns the length of the array minus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function returns the smallest of its two arguments, whereas `length + 1` returns the length of the array plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.min` function returns the smallest of its two arguments, whereas `length * 2` returns the length of the array multiplied by two.

DONE.
