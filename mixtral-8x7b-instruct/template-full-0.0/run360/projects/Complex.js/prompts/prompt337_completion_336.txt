 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would have a constant imaginary part of 1 instead of the original value of the 'b' variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex number would have the same imaginary part as the original Complex number, but the real part would be 0, which is not the same as the original real part 'a'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
