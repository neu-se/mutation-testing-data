  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the values of `a` and `b` are equal, rather than checking if they are both undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the values of `a` and `b` are not equal, rather than checking if they are both undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if either `a` or `b` is undefined, rather than checking if they are both undefined.

DONE.
