  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to start with "https://" instead of "http://", which could cause issues with certain websites that don't support HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any fragments from the URL, which could cause issues with websites that use fragments for navigation or other purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the URL to start with "http://" instead of "https://", which could cause issues with certain websites that require HTTPS.

DONE.
