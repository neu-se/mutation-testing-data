  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.update
```
This would result in different behavior because `update` is not a built-in method of the `Promise` object, so it would cause an error. In contrast, `then` is a built-in method of the `Promise` object that returns a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a method of the `Q` library that returns a promise that is resolved with the given promise's resolution. In contrast, `then` is a method of the `Promise` object that returns a new promise that is resolved with the current promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.nfapply(console.log)
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is a method of the `Q` library that applies a function to an array of arguments, and returns a promise
