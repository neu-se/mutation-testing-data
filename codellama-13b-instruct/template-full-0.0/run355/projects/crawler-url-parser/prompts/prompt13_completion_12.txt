  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the URL would be changed from "http" to "https".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the URL would be changed from "http" to "ftp".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the protocol of the URL would be changed from "http" to "file".

DONE.
