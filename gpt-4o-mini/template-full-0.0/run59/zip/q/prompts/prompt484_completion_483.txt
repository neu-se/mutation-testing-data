Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element from the `unhandledReasons` array instead of returning a copy of the entire array, which would lead to loss of data regarding unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` creates a new array by combining the elements of `unhandledReasons` with no additional arguments, which would not return a copy of the array but rather an empty array if no arguments are provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0, 1)` returns a new array containing only the first element of `unhandledReasons`, rather than a copy of the entire array, potentially leading to incomplete information about unhandled rejections.

DONE.
