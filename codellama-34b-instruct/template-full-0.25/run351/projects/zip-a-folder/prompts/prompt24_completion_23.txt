  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"zip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to "zip" instead of "tar", which would result in a different archive format being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"gzip"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to "gzip" instead of "tar", which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bzip2"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to "bzip2" instead of "tar", which would result in a different compression algorithm being used.

DONE.
