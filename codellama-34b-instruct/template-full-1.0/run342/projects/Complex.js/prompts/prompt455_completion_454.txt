  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `isNaN()` method, potentially causing the `toString()` method to return the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the complex number is finite, potentially causing the `toString()` method to return the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] !== this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are equal, potentially causing the `toString()` method to return the wrong value.

DONE.
