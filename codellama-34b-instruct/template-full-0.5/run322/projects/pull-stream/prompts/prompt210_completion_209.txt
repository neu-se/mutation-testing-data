  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is not defined in the original code, so the `aborted` error would not be passed to the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not defined in the original code, so the `aborted` error would not be passed to the `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(aborted, function (err) {
  cb(err)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function is not defined in the original code, so the `aborted` error would not be passed to the `cb` function.

DONE.
