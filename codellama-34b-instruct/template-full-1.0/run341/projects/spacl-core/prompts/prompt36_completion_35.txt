  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice(2)` method would return a different array, omitting the first two elements of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join('')` method would concatenate the elements of the array into a string, while the original code fragment would return an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).filter(Boolean).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter(Boolean)` method would remove any falsy elements from the array, while the original code fragment would include all elements.

DONE.
