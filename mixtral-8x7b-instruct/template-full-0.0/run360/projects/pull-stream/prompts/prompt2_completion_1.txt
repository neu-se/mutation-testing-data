 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(sources)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the keys of the `sources` object instead of directly using the `sources` object. This could cause issues if the code elsewhere in the application relies on the `sources` object having specific methods or properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assume that `sources` is an array-like object with a `length` property. If `sources` is not an array-like object, this would result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sources()
