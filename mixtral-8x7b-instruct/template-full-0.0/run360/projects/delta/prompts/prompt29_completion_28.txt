 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the keys of the `a` object instead of the `base` object. This could cause the inversion to use incorrect keys when checking for mismatches between `attr` and `base`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object, discarding any differences between `attr` and `base`. This would make the inversion operation less useful, as it would not reflect the actual differences between the two input objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the keys of the `b` object instead of the `base` object. This could cause the inversion to use incorrect keys when checking for mismatches between `attr` and `base`.
