  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack trace, rather than just the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack trace, minus the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.substring(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entire stack trace, minus the first two characters.

DONE.
