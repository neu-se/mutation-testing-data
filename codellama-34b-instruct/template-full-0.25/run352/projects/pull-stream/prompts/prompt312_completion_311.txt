  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was called with `ended` as an argument, which would cause the `terminate` function to be called if `ended` is truthy. However, in this modified code fragment, `cb` is called with `null` and `data` as arguments, which would not cause the `terminate` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` was called with `ended` as an argument, which would cause the `terminate` function to be called if `ended` is truthy. However, in this modified code fragment, `cb` is called with `ended` and `data` as arguments, which would cause the `terminate` function to be called if `ended` is truthy, but would also pass `data` as an argument to the `terminate` function.

Option 3
