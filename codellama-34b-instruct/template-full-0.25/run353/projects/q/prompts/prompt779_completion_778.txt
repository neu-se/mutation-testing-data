  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, without waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled immediately, without waiting for the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled or rejected immediately, without waiting for the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
