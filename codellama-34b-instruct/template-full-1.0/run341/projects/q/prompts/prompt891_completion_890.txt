  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.length` is a number, whereas `args` is an array, and `args` is more likely to be used as a function argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the array, whereas `args` is most likely used as an object with named properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value, whereas `args` is most likely a non-empty array.

DONE.
