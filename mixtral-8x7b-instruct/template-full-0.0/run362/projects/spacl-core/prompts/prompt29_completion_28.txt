 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.join('').match
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `reduce` function to a `match` function, which would return an array of matches instead of reducing the array to a single value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice(1).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the first element of the `parts` array, which could lead to incorrect reduction of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reduce((acc, seg) => acc + seg, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it concatenates the elements of the `parts` array instead of reducing them using the original logic.

DONE.
