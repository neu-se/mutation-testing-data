  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returned a string, while this modified code fragment returns a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().replace(" ", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment trimmed the text, while this modified code fragment replaces spaces with empty strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment trimmed the text, while this modified code fragment splits the text on spaces and joins the resulting array with empty strings.

DONE.
