  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes the value through, while this modified code fragment adds 1 to the value, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes the value through, while this modified code fragment subtracts 1 from the value, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply passes the value through, while this modified code fragment multiplies the value by 2, which could result in a different outcome.

DONE.
