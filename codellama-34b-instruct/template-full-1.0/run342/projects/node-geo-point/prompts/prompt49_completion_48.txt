  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
180 - point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing with the latitudes flipped, potentially leading to a very different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the longitude values of the two points, potentially leading to a very different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the same latitude value for both points, potentially leading to a result of 0 or 180 degrees.

DONE.
