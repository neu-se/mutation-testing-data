  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to concatenate strings, while the new code fragment uses the `\\` operator, which is used for escaping special characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to concatenate strings, while the new code fragment uses the `//` operator, which is used for commenting out code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` operator to concatenate strings, while the new code fragment uses the `\\` operator, which is used for escaping special characters.

DONE.
