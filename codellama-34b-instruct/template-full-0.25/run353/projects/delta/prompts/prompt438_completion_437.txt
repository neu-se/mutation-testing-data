  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the new code checks if it is a string. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the new code checks if it is an object. This could cause the code to behave differently if `nextOp.retain` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `nextOp.retain` is a number, but the new code checks if it is a function. This could cause the code to behave differently if `
