 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` callback would always be invoked, even when `abort` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? null : 'aborting'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onAbort` callback would receive the string 'aborting' instead of the original boolean value of `abort`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
