 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'.'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the filename as `.`, regardless of the URL pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the URL's pathname instead of the path module's basename function, which may not correctly extract the filename if the pathname contains extra information (e.g., query parameters).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random().toString().split('.')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the filename as a random string, instead of using the original filename from the URL pathname.

DONE.
