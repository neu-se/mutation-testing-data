  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different object than `attributes`, and `b` may not have the same properties or values as `attributes`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different object than `attributes`, and `a` may not have the same properties or values as `attributes`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and `Object.keys(null)` would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
