 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && typeof value.then === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` is an object and not null, instead of just checking if it is an instance of Promise. This could lead to false positives for non-promise objects with a `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value && value.constructor.name === 'Promise'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `value` has a constructor property with the name "Promise", instead of checking if it is an instance of Promise. This could lead to false negatives if the constructor's name has been changed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Promise || value.constructor.name === 'Deferred'
```
This would result in different behavior because it also checks if `value` is an instance of "Deferred" (which is not present in the provided
