  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the object, while `JSON.parse` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` with a reviver function would modify the object before it is returned, while the original code does not use a reviver function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.parse` with a null reviver function would return the object as-is, while the original code uses a reviver function to modify the object.

DONE.
