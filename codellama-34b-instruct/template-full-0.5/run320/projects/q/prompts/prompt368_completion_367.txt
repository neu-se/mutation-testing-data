  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `_fulfilled` is a function that returns the fulfilled value, whereas `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `_rejected("error")` is a function that returns a rejected promise with a specific error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `_rejected(new Error("error"))` is a function that returns a rejected promise with a specific error object.

DONE.
