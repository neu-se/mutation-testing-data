  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` refers to the `defer` function, but it is not called, so the promise is never resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a promise that is never resolved or rejected, so the function would hang indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a promise, so the function would throw an error when it tries to call `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());`

DONE.
