  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign a new object to `result[country]` instead of merging the new object with the existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current = result[country].all;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `result[country].all` to `result[country].current` instead of pushing the new timezone ID to the `current` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all = result[country].current;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `result[country].current` to `result[country].all` instead of pushing the new timezone ID to the `all` array.

DONE.
