  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `null` as the `this` value, rather than the `this` value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with `undefined` as the `this` value, rather than the `this` value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, this, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `progressed` function to be called with the `this` value of the promise as the `this` value, rather than the `this` value of the promise.

DONE.
