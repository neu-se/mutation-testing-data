  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.hasNext()` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `thisIter.hasNext` is a property that returns the iterator itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next element in the iterator, while `thisIter.hasNext` returns the iterator itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek()` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing the iterator, while `thisIter.hasNext` returns the iterator itself.

DONE.
