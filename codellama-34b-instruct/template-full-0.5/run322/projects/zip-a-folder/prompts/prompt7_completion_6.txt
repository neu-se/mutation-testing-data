  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string '1' to the targetFilePath, potentially creating a new file or overwriting an existing one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the targetFilePath to uppercase, potentially changing the file path or name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last part of the file path, potentially changing the file path or name.

DONE.
