  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` creates a new deferred object with a null context, whereas `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object with the default context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(undefined)` creates a new deferred object with an undefined context, whereas `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object with the default context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(false)` creates a new deferred object with a false context, whereas `Q.defer` creates a new deferred object with the default context.

DONE.
