  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current module exports object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a private property and should not be exposed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` is a function and should not be used as a property.

DONE.
