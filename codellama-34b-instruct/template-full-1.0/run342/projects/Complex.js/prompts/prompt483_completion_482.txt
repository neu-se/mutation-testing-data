  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
&& true
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `true` when it should be returning `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false` when it should be returning `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
&& 1 == 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `false` when it should be returning `true`.

DONE.
