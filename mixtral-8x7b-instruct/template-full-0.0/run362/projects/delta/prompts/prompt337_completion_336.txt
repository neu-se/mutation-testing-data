 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty array instead of slicing the `base` Delta, causing unexpected results or errors in the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
base.ops.slice(index, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only slices one operation instead of the desired range, causing incorrect handling of operations in the `transform` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```csharp
base.slice(index + 1, index)
