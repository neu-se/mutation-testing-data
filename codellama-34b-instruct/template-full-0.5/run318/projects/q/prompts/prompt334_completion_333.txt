  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.state` is always defined and truthy, whereas `inspect` is a function that may or may not be defined, and may or may not return a truthy value when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect()` is a function call that returns a value, whereas `inspect` is a function that may or may not be defined, and may or may not return a value when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspect.call()` is a function call that returns a value, whereas `inspect` is a function that may or may not be defined, and may or may not return a value when called.

DONE.
