Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero instead of checking if it is infinite, which would change the logic for handling multiplication with zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for infinity, meaning that the condition would pass when the number is not infinite, potentially leading to incorrect results when multiplying with zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks if the real part of the complex number is infinite, ignoring the imaginary part and potentially leading to incorrect handling of cases where the imaginary part is infinite.

DONE.
