  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(':')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first part of the row string, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(':')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second part of the row string, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split(':')[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third part of the row string, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the JSON data.

DONE.
