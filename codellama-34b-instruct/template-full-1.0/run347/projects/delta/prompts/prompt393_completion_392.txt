  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing, which would result in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` is a different iterator than `otherIter`, and would cause the code to look at the wrong data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next value without advancing the iterator, so the code would be looking at the same value over and over again.

DONE.
