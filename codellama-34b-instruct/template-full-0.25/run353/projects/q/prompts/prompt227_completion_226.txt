  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.length` is always truthy, even if `messages` is empty, whereas `messages` is falsy if it's empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages[0]` is always undefined, even if `messages` is empty, whereas `messages` is falsy if it's empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `messages.slice(1)` is always an empty array, even if `messages` is empty, whereas `messages` is falsy if it's empty.

DONE.
