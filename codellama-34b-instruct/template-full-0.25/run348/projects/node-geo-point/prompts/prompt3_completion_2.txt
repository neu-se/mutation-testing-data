  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, while this new code fragment checks for non-strict inequality. This means that the new code fragment would allow for longitude values that are equal to -180 or 180, which may not be desirable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for strict inequality, while this new code fragment checks for non-strict inequality. This means that the new code fragment would allow for longitude values that are equal to -180 or 180, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
