  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrl` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `currentUrl.url` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrl || currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrl` is falsy, while the new code fragment checks if `currentUrl` is truthy or if `currentUrl.url` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl && currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `currentUrl` is truthy and if `currentUrl.url` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if `currentUrl` is truthy or if `currentUrl.url` is truthy.

DONE.
