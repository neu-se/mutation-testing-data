 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the negated character set from `_has_illegal_chars` function, which is more restrictive than the original regex and may cause some valid URLs to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/
