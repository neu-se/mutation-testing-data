 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
eval(Object.keys)
```
This would result in different behavior because `eval` can execute arbitrary code, making the code vulnerable to code injection attacks.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.keys` is a non-standard, deprecated method that returns an iterator instead of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.values
