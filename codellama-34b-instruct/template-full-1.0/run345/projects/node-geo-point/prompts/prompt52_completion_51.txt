  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return acos(r > -1 ? -1 : r) * 6371392.896;
```
This would result in different behavior because the replace Math.acos() Math.cos() function with Math.acos() Math.sin() function that would allow the API calculations to be performed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return tan2[-x] * 6371392.896;
```
This would result in different behavior because The Math.tan() function returns the tangent of an angle, and Math.Tan(-x) would return the negative value of the tangent for the same angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return cos2[-x] * 6371392.896;
```
This would result in different behavior because The Math.cos() function returns the cosine of an angle, and Math.cos(-x) would return the
