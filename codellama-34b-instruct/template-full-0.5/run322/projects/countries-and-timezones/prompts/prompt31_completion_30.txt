  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 61)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset to the nearest hour, rather than the nearest minute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset up to the nearest hour, rather than rounding it down to the nearest minute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the offset to the nearest hour, rather than rounding it down to the nearest minute.

DONE.
