  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'half-open'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.createReadStream()` method will not emit the `'error'` event. Instead, it will emit the `'half-open'` event, which is used to indicate that the stream has not yet fully opened, but is in the process of opening.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.createReadStream()` method will not emit the `'error'` event. Instead, it will emit the `'close'` event, which is used to indicate that the stream has been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.createReadStream()` method will not emit the `'error'` event. Instead, it will emit the `'end
