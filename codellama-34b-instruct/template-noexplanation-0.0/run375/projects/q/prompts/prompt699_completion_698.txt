  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This change will cause the `fbind` function to use the second argument instead of the first argument as the `this` value for the bound function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 0
```
This change will cause the `fbind` function to use the first argument instead of the second argument as the `this` value for the bound function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, void 0
```
This change will cause the `fbind` function to use the `undefined` value as the `this` value for the bound function, which is equivalent to using the global object as the `this` value.

DONE.
