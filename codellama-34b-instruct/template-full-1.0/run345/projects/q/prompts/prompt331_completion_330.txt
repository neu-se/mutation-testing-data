  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolve` is called when the promise is fulfilled. However, with `!resolve`, the `resolve` function would be called when the promise is rejected, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled when it should have been rejected, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolve` is called with a value that is not `undefined`. However, with `null`, the `resolve` function would be called with a value that is `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with an incorrect value, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `resolve` is called when the promise is fulfilled. However, with `false`, the `resolve` function would not be called, leading to the promise remaining
