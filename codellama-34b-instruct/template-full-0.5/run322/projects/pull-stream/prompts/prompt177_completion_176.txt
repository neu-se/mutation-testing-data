  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb(null, array[i++])` expression would be evaluated even if `abort` is `true`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb(null, array[i++])` expression would only be evaluated if `abort` is `true`, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb(null, array[i++])` expression would be compared to `abort`, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
