 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if 'delete' is a property of `otherOp` object, rather than checking if the 'delete' property has a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delete otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it deletes the `otherOp` variable, which may lead to unexpected results or errors in the rest of the code that relies on `otherOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the 'retain' property instead of the 'delete' property, which may cause the following condition to always evaluate to true, resulting in different behavior.

DONE.
