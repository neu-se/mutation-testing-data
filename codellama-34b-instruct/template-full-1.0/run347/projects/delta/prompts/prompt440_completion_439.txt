  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property to be treated as a number, which is not the intention of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property to be treated as a string, which would break the code that relies on the assumption that `insert` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `insert` property to be treated as an object, which would break the code that relies on the assumption that `insert` is a string.

DONE.
