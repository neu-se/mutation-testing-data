  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<object>.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `object` is a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<object>.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `object` is a promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<object>.settle
```
This would result in different behavior because `settle` is a non-standard method that resolves or rejects a promise object based on the state of the provided argument.

DONE.
