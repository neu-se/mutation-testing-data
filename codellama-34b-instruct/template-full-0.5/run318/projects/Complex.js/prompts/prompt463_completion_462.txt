  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if `b` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, regardless of the value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON'] * Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would take into account the magnitude of `a` when determining whether `b` is small enough to be considered zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON'] * Math.abs(a) && a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ensure that `b` is only considered zero if `a` is not zero, which is a more accurate representation of the intended behavior.

DONE.
