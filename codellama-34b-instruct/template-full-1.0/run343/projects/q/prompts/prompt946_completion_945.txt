  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Node function threw an error");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would cause an error to be thrown when the `nodeArgs` array is being constructed, whereas the original code fragment would have added a node resolver function to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.clearNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearNodeResolver()` method would remove the node resolver function from the `deferred` object, whereas the original code fragment would have added the node resolver function to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be added to the `nodeArgs` array, whereas the original code fragment would have added
