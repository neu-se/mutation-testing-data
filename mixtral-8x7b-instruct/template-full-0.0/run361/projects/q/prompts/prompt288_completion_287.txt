 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the deferred object with the current date instead of an empty object. The rest of the code would still execute, but the `deferred` object would not have the expected properties like `promise`, `resolve`, `fulfill`, `reject`, and `notify`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it initializes the deferred object with `null` instead of an empty object. The rest of the code would still execute, but the `deferred` object would not have the expected properties like `promise`, `resolve`, `fulfill`, `reject`, and `notify`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{a: 1}
