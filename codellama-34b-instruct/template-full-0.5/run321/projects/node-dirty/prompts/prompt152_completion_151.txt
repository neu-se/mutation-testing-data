  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `this._waitForDrain`, which means that the code inside the `if` block would be executed even if `this._waitForDrain` is `true`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that the code inside the `if` block would only be executed if `this._waitForDrain` is `false`, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `? :` operator checks for the truthiness of `this._waitForDrain`, which means that the code inside the `if` block would be executed
