  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set()` would throw an error when trying to set a property on `null`, whereas the original code would set the property on the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set()` would throw an error when trying to set a property on `undefined`, whereas the original code would set the property on the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.set()` would set the property on a new empty object, whereas the original code would set the property on the original object.

DONE.
