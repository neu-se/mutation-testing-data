  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path` is a different value than `ctx`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.verb` is a different value than `ctx`, which is the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path + ctx.verb
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.path + ctx.verb` is a different value than `ctx`, which is the original code fragment.

DONE.
