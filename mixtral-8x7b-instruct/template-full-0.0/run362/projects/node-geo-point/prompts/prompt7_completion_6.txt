 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'type' in point && 'coordinates' in point
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the presence of properties using the `in` operator instead of using `hasOwnProperty()`. This could lead to false positives if the object has inherited properties with the same names.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
point.type !== undefined && point.coordinates !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of properties using the `undefined` check, which would not account for properties that are explicitly set to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(point).length === 2 && point.type && point.coordinates
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the number of keys in the object and whether the properties are truthy, which could lead to false positives if the properties are set to falsy values like `0`, `''`,
