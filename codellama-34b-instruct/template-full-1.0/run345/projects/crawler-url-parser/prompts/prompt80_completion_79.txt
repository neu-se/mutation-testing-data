  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).removeAttr
```
This would result in different behavior because `removeAttr` is a different method than `attr` and would remove any attributes from the element, whereas `attr` would only retrieve the value of an attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop` is a different method than `attr` and would retrieve the value of a property on the element, whereas `attr` would only retrieve the value of an attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').attr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retrieve the attribute of the first `a` element in the jQuery object, whereas the original code would retrieve the attribute of the current element in the loop.

DONE.
