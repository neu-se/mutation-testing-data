  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` would call the callback function, while the new code fragment `function() {}` would create a new function that does nothing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` would call the callback function, while the new code fragment `callback.bind(null)` would create a new function that calls the callback function with a null context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `callback` would call the callback function, while the new code fragment `callback.bind(this)` would create a new function that calls the callback function with the `this` context of the current function.

DONE.
