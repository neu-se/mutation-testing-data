  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw rejection;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is inside a promise callback, which catches and handles any errors that occur, while this code would propagate the error to the parent promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount++;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only increments the pendingCount if there was a rejection, while this code would always increment the pendingCount.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve('mock value');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with the value of the last resolved promise, while this code would resolve the promise with a hardcoded string value regardless of the actual resolved value.

DONE.
