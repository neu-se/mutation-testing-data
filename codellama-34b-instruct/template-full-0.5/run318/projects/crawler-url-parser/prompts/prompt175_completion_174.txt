  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, but the replacement code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, but the replacement code fragment is a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, but the replacement code fragment is an undefined value.

DONE.
