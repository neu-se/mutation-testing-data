  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with the `end` argument, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment simply calls the `done` callback without any arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with two arguments, `null` and `end`, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment only calls the `done` callback with one argument, `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

done(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `done` callback with two arguments, `end` and `null`, which is not the intended behavior. The original code fragment only calls the `done` callback with one argument, `end`.

DONE.
