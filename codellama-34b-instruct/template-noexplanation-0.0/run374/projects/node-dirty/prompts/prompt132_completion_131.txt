  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.entries()
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `this._queue` object, rather than just the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of Object.entries(this._queue)
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the key-value pairs of the `this._queue` object, rather than just the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] of this._queue.keys()
```
This change will cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the keys of the `this._queue` object, rather than the key-value pairs.

DONE.
