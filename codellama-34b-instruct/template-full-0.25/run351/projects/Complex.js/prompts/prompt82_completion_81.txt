  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'j' || c === 'J'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "j" or "J" instead of "i" or "I", which would cause the code to behave differently for inputs that contain those letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'k' || c === 'K'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "k" or "K" instead of "i" or "I", which would cause the code to behave differently for inputs that contain those letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === 'l' || c === 'L'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking for the letter "l" or "L" instead of "i" or "I", which would cause the code to behave differently for inputs that contain those letters.

DONE.
