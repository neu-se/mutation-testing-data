  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be stored in the database, which is not the intended behavior of the `rm` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, null, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be stored in the database, which is not the intended behavior of the `rm` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, 'undefined', cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'undefined'` would be stored in the database, which is not the intended behavior of the `rm` method.

DONE.
