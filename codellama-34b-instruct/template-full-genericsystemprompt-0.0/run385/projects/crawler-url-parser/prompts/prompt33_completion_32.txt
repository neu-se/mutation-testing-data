  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "https://".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "ftp://".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "file://".

DONE.
