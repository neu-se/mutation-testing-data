  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is replaced with `Math.tan`, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is replaced with `Math.sinh`, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.asin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is replaced with `Math.asin`, which would cause the method to return a different value.

DONE.
