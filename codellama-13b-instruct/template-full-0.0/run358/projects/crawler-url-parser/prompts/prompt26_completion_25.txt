  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any characters after the hash symbol (#) in the URL, while the new code fragment replaces the hash symbol with a space. This could potentially cause issues if the URL contains a hash symbol that is not intended to be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any characters after the hash symbol (#) in the URL, while the new code fragment removes the entire hash symbol and any characters that follow it. This could potentially cause issues if the URL contains a hash symbol that is not intended to be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes any characters after the hash symbol (#) in the URL, while the new code fragment replaces the hash symbol with the string "http://".
