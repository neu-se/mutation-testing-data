 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would always evaluate to true, bypassing the short-circuit evaluation and potentially causing incorrect results when the divisor is not infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number `z` is infinity, which is not the same as checking if the entire complex number `z` is infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number is zero, which is not the same as checking if the other complex number `z` is infinity.

DONE.
