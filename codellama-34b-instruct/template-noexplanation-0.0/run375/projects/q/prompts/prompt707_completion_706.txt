  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This change will cause the `fbound` function to ignore the first argument passed to it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This change will cause the `fbound` function to only consider the first argument passed to it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This change will cause the `fbound` function to consider only the second and subsequent arguments passed to it, which may cause unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
