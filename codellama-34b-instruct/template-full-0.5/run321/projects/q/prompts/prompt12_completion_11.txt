  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses !== "undefined" && ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code if the `ses` variable is defined and the `ok` method returns `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ses === "undefined" || !ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code if the `ses` variable is not defined or the `ok` method returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.ok()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code if the `ok` method returns `true`, regardless of whether the `ses` variable is defined or not.

DONE.
