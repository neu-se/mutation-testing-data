  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of uncorking the stream when the queue is empty, it would always uncork the stream, potentially causing the stream to become uncorked multiple times.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._queue.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of uncorking the stream when the queue is empty, it would uncork the stream based on the size of the queue, potentially causing the stream to become uncorked more frequently than necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork(this._inFlightWrites);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of uncorking the stream when the queue is empty, it would uncork the stream based on the number of in-flight writes, potentially causing the stream to become unc
