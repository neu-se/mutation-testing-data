  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.post
```
This would result in different behavior because `post` is not a method of the `Promise` object, and would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a method of the `Promise` object, but `bind` would return a new function that is bound to the `this` context of the `Promise` object, which would not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` would call the `dispatch` method with the `this` context of the `Promise` object and the `arguments` object as the arguments, which would not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
