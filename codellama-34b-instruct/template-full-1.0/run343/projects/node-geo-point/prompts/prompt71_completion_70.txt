  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDERcan be replacedwith:
```
var δ = Math.PI / 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of the mathematical constant pi divided by 180 would significantly change the expression. The original code used the decimal degrees to calculate the bearing, and this change would cause the bearing calculation to be much more precise and precise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var λ1 = λ1 % 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of the modulo operator would cause the longitude value to be repeated in the range of 0 to 360, causing the bearing calculation to wrap around to the starting point after exceeding ±180.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var θ = θ + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the use of a random number between 0.5 and -0.5
