Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the angle used in the sine function, effectively shifting the imaginary part of the complex number, which changes the output of the `pow` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the angle used in the sine function, which can significantly affect the resulting imaginary part of the complex number, leading to incorrect calculations in the `pow` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original angle with a constant value of Ï€, which would yield a fixed imaginary part in the resulting complex number, regardless of the input values, leading to incorrect results in the `pow` function.

DONE.
