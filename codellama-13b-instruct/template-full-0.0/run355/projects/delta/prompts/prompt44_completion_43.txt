  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' || a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is an object or null, while the buggy code fragment checks if `a` is not an object or null. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when `a` is an object or null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is an object or null, while the buggy code fragment checks if `a` is not an object and not null. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain scenarios, such as when `a` is an object or null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' || a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is an object or null, while
