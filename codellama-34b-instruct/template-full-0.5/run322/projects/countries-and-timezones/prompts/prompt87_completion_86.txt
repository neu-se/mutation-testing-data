  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getCountry` returns a single country object, whereas `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezonesForCountry` returns an array of timezone objects, whereas `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getAllCountries
```
This would result in different behavior because `getAllCountries` returns an object with all countries, whereas `getCountriesForTimezone` returns an array of country objects for a specific timezone.

DONE.
