  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, while `defer(null)` would return a deferred object with a null value. This could cause the promise chain to resolve with a null value instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, while `defer(undefined)` would return a deferred object with an undefined value. This could cause the promise chain to resolve with an undefined value instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that returns a new deferred object, while `defer(new Error())` would return a deferred object with an error value. This could cause the promise chain to reject
