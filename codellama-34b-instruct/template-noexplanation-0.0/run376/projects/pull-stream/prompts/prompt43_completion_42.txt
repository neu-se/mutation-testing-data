  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(1)
```
This code fragment will return a new array containing all the elements of `ref` except the first one, which is the opposite of the original code fragment `ref` which returns the first element of `ref`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This code fragment will remove and return the last element of `ref`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment `ref` which returns the first element of `ref`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift()
```
This code fragment will remove and return the first element of `ref`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment `ref` which returns the first element of `ref`.

DONE.
