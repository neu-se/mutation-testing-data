  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the reduced value, while this new code fragment calls the callback with both the error and the reduced value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the reduced value and the error, while this new code fragment only calls the callback with the reduced value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the reduced value and the error, while this new code fragment calls the callback with the error and a null value.

DONE.
