Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to return early if the next operation is a delete instead of an insert, potentially skipping over important operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to check for a retain operation instead of an insert, which could lead to incorrect processing of the operations in the delta, affecting the final output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the method to always return early, as the check for the operation type would fail, preventing any operations from being processed and resulting in an empty or incorrect delta.

DONE.
