  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output = <PLACEHOLDER>(targetFilePath);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `output` variable with the return value of the `targetFilePath` function, which might not be a writeable stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output = <PLACEHOLDER>(src);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `output` variable with the return value of the `src` function, which might not be a writeable stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output = <PLACEHOLDER>({ src, targetFilePath });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the `output` variable with the return value of the `src` function called with the argument `targetFilePath`, which might not be a writeable stream.

DONE.
