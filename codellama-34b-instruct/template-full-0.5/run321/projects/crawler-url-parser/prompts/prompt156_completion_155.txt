  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last part of the path, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "."
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last part of the path, while the new code fragment replaces it with a dot.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last part of the path, while the new code fragment replaces it with a backslash.

DONE.
