 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'isNaN' function would return true for complex numbers with a non-NaN real part and a zero imaginary part, while the original code correctly returns false for such numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'isNaN' function would return false for complex numbers with a NaN real part and a non-NaN imaginary part, while the original code correctly returns true for such numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'isNaN' function would return true for complex numbers with a NaN imaginary part and a non-NaN real part, while the original code correctly returns true only for complex numbers with a NaN real part.

DONE.
