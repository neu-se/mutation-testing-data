  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer receive any options, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.country = 'USA'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be operating on a different country, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.timezone = 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be operating on a different timezone, which could cause errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
