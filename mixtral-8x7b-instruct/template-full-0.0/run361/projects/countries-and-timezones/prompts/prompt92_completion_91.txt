 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with an argument of '0' instead of the `countryId` variable. This could cause unexpected results or errors if the '0' value is not a valid country ID.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
data.countries['0']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with the hardcoded country ID '0' instead of the `countryId` variable. This could cause unexpected results or errors if the '0' value is not a valid country ID.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with a random number instead of the `countryId` variable. This could cause unexpected results or errors if the random number does not correspond to a valid country ID.
