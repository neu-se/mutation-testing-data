  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice()
```
This change will cause the `push` method to create a shallow copy of the `rules` array, rather than modifying the original array. This can help to avoid unintended side effects and make the code more predictable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.concat()
```
This change will cause the `push` method to create a new array that is the concatenation of the `rules` array and the new rule. This can help to avoid modifying the original array and make the code more functional.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.map((rule) => rule.clone())
```
This change will cause the `push` method to create a new array that is the result of mapping each rule in the `rules` array to a new rule that is a clone of the original rule. This can help to avoid modifying the original rules and make the code more object-oriented.

DONE.
