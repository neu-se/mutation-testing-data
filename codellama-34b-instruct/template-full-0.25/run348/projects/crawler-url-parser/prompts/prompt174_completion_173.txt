  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not logging anything to the console.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(res);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not logging the `res` variable to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(res1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is not logging the `res1` variable to the console.

DONE.
