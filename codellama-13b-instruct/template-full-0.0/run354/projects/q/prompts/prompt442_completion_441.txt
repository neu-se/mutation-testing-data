  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason "unhandledRejection" instead of the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason "rejectionHandled" instead of the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the reason "rejectionRejected" instead of the original reason.

DONE.
