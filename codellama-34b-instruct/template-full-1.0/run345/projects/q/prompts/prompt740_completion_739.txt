  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` is not a valid method in Q.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q()` is not a valid method in Q.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` statements can be used to intentionally cause exceptions and test the corresponding exception handling logic.

DONE.
