  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `null` is not an object. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with the `this` value of the `isStopIteration` function, which is an object. By replacing it with `null`, the function will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `Symbol.toStringTag` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_toString.call(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_toString` is a function that expects an object as its argument, but `undefined` is not an object. In the original code, `object_toString` is called with the `this` value of the `isStopIteration` function, which is an object. By replacing it with `undefined`, the function will throw a `TypeError` when it tries to access the `Symbol.toString
