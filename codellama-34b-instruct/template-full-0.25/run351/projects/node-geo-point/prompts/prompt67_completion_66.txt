  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because `x` is not defined in the function, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `y` is already a number, and multiplying it by 2 would change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cos(θ)` is a different mathematical operation than `y`, and would produce a different result.

DONE.
