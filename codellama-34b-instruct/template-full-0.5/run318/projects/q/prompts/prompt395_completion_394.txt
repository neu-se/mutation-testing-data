  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function, and `this.then.call(this)` would invoke the function with `this` as the context, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function, and `this.then.bind(this)` would create a new function with `this` as the context, which would likely cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a function, and `this.then.apply(this)` would invoke the function with `this` as the context and an empty argument list, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
