  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().replace("process", "Q")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `process` variable, which is used in the `isNodeJS` check, and could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().replace("process", "process.env")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `process` variable, which is used in the `isNodeJS` check, and could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.toString().replace("process", "Q.env")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the value of the `process` variable, which is used in the `isNodeJS` check, and could potentially cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
