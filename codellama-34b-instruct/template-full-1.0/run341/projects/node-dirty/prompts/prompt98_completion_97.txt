  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and code that listens to the `'error'` event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'notify'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and code that listens to the `'error'` event would not be triggered.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
'error'
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code fragment, and would not test the mutation.

DONE.
