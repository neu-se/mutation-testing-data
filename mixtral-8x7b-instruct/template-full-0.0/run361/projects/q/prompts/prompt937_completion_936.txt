 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would always insert an additional argument (3) to the node function, which would change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would not insert any argument to the node function, and the behavior of the function would change based on the number and type of arguments it expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nbind` function would insert an empty function as the last argument to the node function, which would change the behavior of the function based on how it handles additional arguments.

DONE.
