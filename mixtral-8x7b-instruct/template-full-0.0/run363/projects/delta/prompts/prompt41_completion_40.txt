 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with the properties of `b`, instead of using the `attributes` variable that contains the merged properties of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns an empty object, regardless of the input. The original implementation returns `undefined` if there are no attributes left after the transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(b).reduce((attrs, key) => {
  if (a[key] === undefined) {
    attrs[key] = b[key] || null;
  }
  return attrs;
}, {} as AttributeMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null` if `b[key]` is falsy, whereas the original implementation keeps the
