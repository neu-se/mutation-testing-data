  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.Context
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.Context` is a different method than `URL.Resolve` and would resolve the URL in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.Join
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.Join` is a different method than `URL.Resolve` and would resolve the URL in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.Match
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.Match` is a different method than `URL.Resolve` and would match the URL in a different way.

DONE.
