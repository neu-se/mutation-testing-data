  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1], ref[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which could cause the function to behave differently when the arguments are not commutative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1], ref[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is changed from `ref[2]` to `ref[1]`, which could cause the function to behave differently when the third argument is not the same as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull(read, ref[1], ref[3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument is changed from `ref[2]` to `ref[3]`, which could cause the function to behave differently when the third argument is not the same as the second argument.

DONE.
