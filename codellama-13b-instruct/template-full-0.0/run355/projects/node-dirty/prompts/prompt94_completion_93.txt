  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function returns a string representation of the input, while `JSON.parse` returns the parsed value. In this case, the `JSON.stringify` function would return a string representation of the `row` object, which would be different from the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` function returns the parsed value of the input, while `JSON.stringify` returns a string representation of the input. In this case, the `JSON.parse` function would return the parsed value of the `row` object, which would be different from the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(row, null, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.stringify` function with the `null` and `2` arguments returns a string representation of the
