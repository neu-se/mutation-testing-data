Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(a * a + b * b, 1/3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the cube root of the sum of squares instead of the square root, which would lead to incorrect results in the context of calculating the hypotenuse.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it computes the absolute value of the sum of `a` and `b`, rather than the hypotenuse, which would not correctly represent the distance in a Cartesian plane.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply adds `a` and `b` together instead of calculating the hypotenuse, which would yield a completely incorrect value for the distance.

DONE.
