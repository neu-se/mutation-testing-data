  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `a`, whereas the original code fragment simply uses the value of `a` as-is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not used in the original code fragment, so the replacement would introduce a new variable into the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the value of `a`, whereas the original code fragment simply uses the value of `a` as-is.

DONE.
