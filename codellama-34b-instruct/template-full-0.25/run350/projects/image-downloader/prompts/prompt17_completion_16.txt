  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `decodeURIComponent` to decode the basename, which may not produce the same result as `toLowerCase`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(pathname).toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `path.basename` to get the basename, which may not produce the same result as `toLowerCase`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `url.pathname` to get the pathname, which may not produce the same result as `toLowerCase`.

DONE.
