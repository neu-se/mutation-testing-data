  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is the negation of `ended`, so the callback would be called with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended && false` is always false, so the callback would never be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `ended || true` is always true, so the callback would always be called.

DONE.
