  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL using the base URL as the context, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedBaseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL using the parsed URL as the context, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the URL using the parsed URL as the context, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
