  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id + 1
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id - 1
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, id * 2
```
This change will cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one requested, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle unexpected input.

DONE.
