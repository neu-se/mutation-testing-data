  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `next` method of the `otherIter` object, while the new code fragment is a call to the `next` method with no arguments. This could result in different behavior if the `next` method has side effects or if the `otherIter` object is not in the same state as it was in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `next` method of the `otherIter` object, while the new code fragment is a call to the `next` method with an argument of `1`. This could result in different behavior if the `next` method has side effects or if the `otherIter` object is not in the same state as it was in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
