  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function returns a value between -1 and 1, while the `asin` function returns a value between 0 and π/2. This change would cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function returns a value between -1 and 1, while the `asin` function returns a value between 0 and π/2. This change would cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce incorrect results for certain input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan` function returns a value between -1 and 1, while the `asin` function returns a value between 0 and π/2. This change
