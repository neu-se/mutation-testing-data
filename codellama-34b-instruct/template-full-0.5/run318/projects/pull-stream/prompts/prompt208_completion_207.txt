  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is an error object, and `aborted.message` is a string that contains the error message. The original code fragment simply returns the error object, which may not be what the user expects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a function, and `aborted()` would call the function and return its result. The original code fragment simply returns the error object, which may not be what the user expects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that indicates the absence of any object value. The original code fragment returns the error object, which may not be what the user expects.

DONE.
