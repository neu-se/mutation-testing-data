  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a method that adds an element to the end of an array, whereas `concat` is a method that returns a new array that is the result of concatenating two or more arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse` is a method that reverses the order of the elements in an array, whereas `concat` is a method that returns a new array that is the result of concatenating two or more arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` is a method that creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `concat` is a method that returns a new array that is the result of concatenating two or more arrays.

DONE.
