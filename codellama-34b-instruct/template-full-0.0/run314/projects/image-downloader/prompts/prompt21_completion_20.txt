  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is not defined in the function, and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the case of the `options.dest` string, which could affect the file path resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the parent directory of `options.dest`, which could affect the file path resolution.

DONE.
