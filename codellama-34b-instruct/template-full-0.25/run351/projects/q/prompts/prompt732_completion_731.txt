  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only ever incremented, never decremented, so it will never be less than 0. This would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to never be executed, even if all of the promises have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable is only ever incremented, never decremented, so it will never be equal to the length of the `promises` array. This would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to never be executed, even if all of the promises have been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promises` array is only ever appended to, never modified, so it will never
