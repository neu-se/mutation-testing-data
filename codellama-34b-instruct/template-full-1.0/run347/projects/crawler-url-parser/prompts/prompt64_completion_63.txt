  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { domain: parsedUrl.hostname, subdomain: parsedUrl.hostname.split('.').reverse()[1] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the second-level domain as the subdomain, regardless of whether the URL has a subdomain or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { domain: parsedUrl.hostname, subdomain: parsedUrl.hostname.split('.').reverse()[2] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the third-level domain as the subdomain, regardless of whether the URL has a subdomain or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return { domain: parsedUrl.hostname, subdomain: parsedUrl.hostname.split('.').reverse()[0] };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the top-level domain as the subdomain, regardless of whether the URL has a subdomain or not.

DONE.
