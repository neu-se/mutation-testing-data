  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the original `hasOwnProperty` method, but call it with a different `this` value, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that is bound to the `obj` object, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently when called with a different `this` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(obj, [prop])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `hasOwnProperty` method with a different `this` value and a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the method to behave differently.

DONE.
