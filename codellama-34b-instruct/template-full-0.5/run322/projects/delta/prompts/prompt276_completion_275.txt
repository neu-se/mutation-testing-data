  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain()` expects a number or an object with a `length` property, but `otherOp` is an object with an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.insert);
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain()` expects a number or an object with a `length` property, but `otherOp.insert` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(Op.length(otherOp.insert));
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain()` expects a number or an object with a `length` property, but `otherOp.insert` is a string.

DONE.
