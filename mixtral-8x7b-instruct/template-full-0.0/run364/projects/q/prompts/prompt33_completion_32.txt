 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => { throw new Error('Buggy!') }
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error is thrown instead of executing the original task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because the task is replaced with a no-op function, which does nothing. This could potentially cause some parts of the code to not execute as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(task, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the task is wrapped in a `setTimeout` call with a delay of 0 milliseconds. This could cause the task to be executed asynchronously, potentially causing issues if the code expects the task to be executed synchronously.

DONE.
