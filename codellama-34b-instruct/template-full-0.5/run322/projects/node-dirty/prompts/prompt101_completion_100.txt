  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, but `undefined` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a strict equality operator that checks for both value and type, whereas `===` is a non-strict equality operator that only checks for value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is a logical NOT operator that returns `true` if the operand is falsy, and `false` otherwise.

DONE.
