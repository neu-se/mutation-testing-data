  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method uses the `cos` value to compute the bearing, and if `cos` is set to 0, the bearing calculation will always return 0, regardless of the actual coordinate values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y = 100;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method uses the `cos` value to compute the distance, and if `cos` is set to a large value, the distance calculation will always return a large value, regardless of the actual coordinate values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y = (φ2 + φ1) / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method uses the `cos` value to compute the bearing, and if `cos` is set to the average of the two latitude values, the bearing calculation will always return
