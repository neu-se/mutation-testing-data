  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this modified code checks if both are numbers. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings but not numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.insert === 'playlist' &&
          newOp.insert === 'list'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this modified code checks if `lastOp.insert` is the string 'playlist' and `newOp.insert` is the string 'list'. This would cause the code to behave differently in cases where `lastOp.insert` is 'playlist' and `newOp.insert` is 'list', but
