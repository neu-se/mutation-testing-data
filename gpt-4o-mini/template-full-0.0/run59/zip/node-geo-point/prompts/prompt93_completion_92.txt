Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation of the `sinφ2` variable, which affects the latitude of the destination point, potentially leading to incorrect geographical results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosφ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the calculation of the `sinφ2` variable, which could lead to an incorrect latitude calculation for the destination point, resulting in an inaccurate geographical position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively removes the influence of the bearing on the calculation of the destination point, leading to a fixed latitude and longitude that does not account for the intended direction of travel.

DONE.
