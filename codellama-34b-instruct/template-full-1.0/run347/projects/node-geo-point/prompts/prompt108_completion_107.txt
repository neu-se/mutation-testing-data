  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
20 + zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `20 + zoom` expression would change the value of `x` and `y` in the `toTile` method, potentially returning a different tile coordinate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zoom + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom + 1` expression would change the value of `x` and `y` in the `toTile` method, potentially returning a different tile coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
zoom - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zoom - 1` expression would change the value of `x` and `y` in the `toTile` method, potentially returning a different tile coordinate.

DONE.
