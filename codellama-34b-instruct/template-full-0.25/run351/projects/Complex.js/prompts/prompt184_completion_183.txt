  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0, but this replacement code fragment checks if `a` is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0, but this replacement code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 && a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than 0, but this replacement code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0.

DONE.
