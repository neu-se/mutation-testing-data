  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different values in different parts of the code, which would cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and it is used in different parts of the code to calculate angles and distances. Changing its value would cause the function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` is a function that returns the square root of a number, and it is used in different parts of the code to calculate distances and angles. Changing its behavior would cause the function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
