  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method would be called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.on('drain', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `on` method would be called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.off('drain', () => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `off` method would be called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

DONE.
