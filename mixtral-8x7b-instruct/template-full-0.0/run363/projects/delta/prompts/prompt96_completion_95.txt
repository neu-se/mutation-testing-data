 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always insert the newOp at the end of the array, instead of considering the index variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an out-of-bounds error when accessing the lastOp variable, which would expose potential issues with error handling in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose an index to insert the newOp, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application and expose potential issues with the test suite's ability to handle randomness.

DONE.
