  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key++
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, which would cause the set method to store the value at a different key than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be incremented by 1, but the value would not be stored at the new key. Instead, it would be stored at the original key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the key would be concatenated with the string 'a', which would cause the set method to store the value at a different key than intended.

DONE.
