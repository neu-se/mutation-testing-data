  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a string literal "+" instead of the actual plus sign.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a string literal "-" instead of the actual minus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a string literal "*" instead of the actual plus sign.

DONE.
