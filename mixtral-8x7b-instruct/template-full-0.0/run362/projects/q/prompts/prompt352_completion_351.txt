 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(rejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection would be wrapped in a promise, and the original code does not wrap the rejection in a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(rejected)
