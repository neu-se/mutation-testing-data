  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` property of the `attributes` object, rather than the `attributes` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the keys of the `attributes` object, rather than the `attributes` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the values of the `attributes` object, rather than the `attributes` object itself.

DONE.
