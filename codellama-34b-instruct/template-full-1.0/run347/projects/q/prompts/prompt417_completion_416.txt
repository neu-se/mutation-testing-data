  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Q
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isPending` function checks the `state` property of the `inspect` object. However, in this modified code, `Q` is set to `false`, so the `isPending` function will always return `false`, even if the promise is actually still pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isPending` function checks the `state` property of the `inspect` object. However, in this modified code, `null` is not an object, so the `isPending` function will always return `false`, even if the promise is actually still pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `isPending` function checks the `state` property of the `inspect` object. However,
