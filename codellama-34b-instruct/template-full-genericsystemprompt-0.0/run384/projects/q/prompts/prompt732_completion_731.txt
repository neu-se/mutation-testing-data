  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be negative, which would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, regardless of whether all promises have been resolved or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be equal to the number of promises, which would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, regardless of whether all promises have been resolved or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be greater than zero, which would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed immediately, regardless of whether all promises have been resolved or not.

DONE.
