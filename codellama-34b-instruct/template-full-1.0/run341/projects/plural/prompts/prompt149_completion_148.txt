  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === undefined && null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would cause the if statement to always evaluate to false, resulting in the function always returning the default plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural !== undefined || null
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would cause the if statement to always evaluate to true, resulting in the function always returning the input string as-is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural === undefined && null === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the null value would cause the if statement to always evaluate to false, resulting in the function always returning the default plural form. This is similar to Option 1, but the null value is included in the if statement to demonstrate how mutation testing can be used to identify different code paths.

DONE.
