 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity, regardless of the value of 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isZero
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the Complex object itself is zero, rather than checking if its 're' property is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return this.re === 0 && this.im === 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if both 're' and 'im' properties are zero, but it would not take into account the special case of Infinity and -Infinity.

DONE.
