  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that handles errors, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `errback` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, even if the operation was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `Q.reject` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the operation was successful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that creates a resolved promise, while `callback` is a function that handles successful results. Using `Q.resolve` instead of `callback` would cause the promise to be resolved, even if
