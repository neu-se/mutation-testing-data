  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength() + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the `otherIter` peek length, potentially causing the `while` loop to iterate one more time than necessary.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.max(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `length` variable to the maximum of the `peekLength` values of `thisIter` and `otherIter`, potentially causing the `while` loop to iterate more times than necessary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength() - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the `otherIter`
