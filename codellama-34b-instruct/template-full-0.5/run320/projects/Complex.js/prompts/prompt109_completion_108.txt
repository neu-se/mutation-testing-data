  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks whether a value is Not a Number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` checks whether a value is Not a Number, while `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks whether a value is Not a Number, while `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number.

DONE.
