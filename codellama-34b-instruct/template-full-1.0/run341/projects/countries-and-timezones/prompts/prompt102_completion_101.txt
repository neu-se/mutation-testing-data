  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.freeze
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.freeze` prevents the addition of new properties to an object, while `Object.assign` simply copies the properties of one object to another.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of strings containing the names of the enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.assign` simply copies the properties of one object to another.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of strings containing the values of the enumerable properties of an object, while `Object.assign` simply copies the properties of one object to another.

DONE.
