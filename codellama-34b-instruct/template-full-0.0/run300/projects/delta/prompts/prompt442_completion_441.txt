  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to calculate the length of the substring, and adding 1 to it would cause the substring to be one character longer than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to calculate the length of the substring, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the substring to be one character shorter than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `offset` variable is used to calculate the length of the substring, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the substring to be twice as long as intended.

DONE.
