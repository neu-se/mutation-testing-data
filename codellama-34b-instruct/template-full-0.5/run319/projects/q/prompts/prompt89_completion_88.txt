  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `call` function as the `this` value, rather than the `f` function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second argument of the `call` function as the `this` value, rather than the `f` function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f, []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty array as the `this` value, rather than the `f` function itself.

DONE.
