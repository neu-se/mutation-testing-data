  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator before the `verb` variable would negate its value, causing the `query` method to return the opposite of what it would have returned with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would concatenate the `verb` variable with the string `'abc'`, causing the `query` method to return a different value than it would have returned with the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `verb` variable to uppercase, causing the `query` method to return a different value than it would have returned with the original code fragment.

DONE.
