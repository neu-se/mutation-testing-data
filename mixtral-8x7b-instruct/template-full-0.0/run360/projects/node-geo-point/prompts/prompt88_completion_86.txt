 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.cos` function is called with the argument, which would always return a positive value between -1 and 1, while the original code uses the `cos` function from the global scope, which could have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.acos` function is the inverse of the `Math.cos` function, and would return the angle in radians for which the cosine is the given value, while the original code uses `cos` to calculate the cosine of the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0.5 * Math.cos
