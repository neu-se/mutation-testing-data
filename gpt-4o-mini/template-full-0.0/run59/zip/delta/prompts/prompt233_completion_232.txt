Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to attempt to read one more element than is available in the `otherIter`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect behavior when processing the operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to read one extra operation than intended, which could lead to incorrect processing of the `otherIter` operations, resulting in unexpected behavior in the delta output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to read one less operation than intended, which could lead to missing an operation in the `otherIter`, potentially resulting in an incomplete or incorrect delta output.

DONE.
