  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(Boolean).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter(Boolean)` would remove any falsy values from the `values` array, which could cause the `map` function to not iterate over all the elements in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.slice(1).map
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array with all the elements of `values` except the first one, which could cause the `map` function to not iterate over the first element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reverse().map
```
This would result in different behavior because `reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the `values` array, which could cause the `map` function to not iterate over the elements in the correct order.

DONE.
