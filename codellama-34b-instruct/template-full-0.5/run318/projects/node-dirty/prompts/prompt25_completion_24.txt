  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with no arguments, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a single argument `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('dummy error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with no arguments, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a single argument `new Error('dummy error')`, which is an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback function with no arguments, while this new code fragment calls the callback function with a single argument `this`, which is a reference to the current object.

DONE.
