  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "goat" is not the same as "goose" and would not be caught by the existing rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'geese'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "geese" is already defined as the plural form of "goose" in the existing rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of "goose" and "s" would result in "gooses", which is not the correct plural form of "goose".

DONE.
