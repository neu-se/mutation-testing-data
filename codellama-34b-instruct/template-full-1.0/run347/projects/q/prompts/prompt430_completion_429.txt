  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not a property of the `object` instance, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `state` property is not defined on the `object` instance, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` variable is not defined, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
