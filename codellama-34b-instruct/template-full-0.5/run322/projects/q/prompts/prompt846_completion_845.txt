  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.then(rejected, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the arguments in reverse order, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.then(void 0, rejected);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the arguments in reverse order, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.
