  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(π - Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere, while the replacement code calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a flat plane.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1.1 * Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere, while the replacement code scales the bearing by a factor of 1.1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(π - Δλ) - 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere, while the replacement code calculates the bearing between two points on the surface of a sphere with an offset of -360 degrees.

DONE.
