  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.value` may not exist on the object, whereas `data` is guaranteed to exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.key` may not exist on the object, whereas `data` is guaranteed to exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` is a function that only exists on strings, whereas `data` may be any type of object.

DONE.
