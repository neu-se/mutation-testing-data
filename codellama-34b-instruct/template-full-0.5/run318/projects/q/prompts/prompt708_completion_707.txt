  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first argument of the `fbound` function to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing an empty array as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments of the `fbound` function to the `dispatch` method, except for the first one, instead of passing an empty array as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first two arguments of the `fbound` function to the `dispatch` method, instead of passing an empty array as in the original code.

DONE.
