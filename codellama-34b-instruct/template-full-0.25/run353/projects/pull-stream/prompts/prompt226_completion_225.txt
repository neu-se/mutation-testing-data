  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return test(data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the logical NOT operator to negate the result of the `test` function, while this new code fragment does not negate the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) && data.length > 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the `test` function returns a falsy value, while this new code fragment also checks if the `data` object has a non-zero length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return !test(data) || data.length === 0 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if the `test` function returns a falsy value, while this new code fragment also checks if the `data` object has a zero length.
