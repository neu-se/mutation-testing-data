 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always fulfill with an empty object instead of the original object passed to `Q.master()`. This change could cause issues if the code relies on the returned object to have the same properties as the input object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Q.reject(new Error('Master promise rejected')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always reject with an error, whereas the original implementation only rejects the promise if an error occurs during the execution of the `inspect` method. This change could cause issues if the code expects the returned promise to fulfill under normal circumstances.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (op, args) { return Q.reject(new Error('Invalid operation')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always reject with an error indicating an invalid operation
