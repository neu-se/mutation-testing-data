Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(urlMap.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the values of the `urlMap` into an array using `slice`, which may not handle the iterable correctly compared to `Array.from`, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the keys of the `urlMap` instead of the values, which would change the output structure and potentially lead to incorrect data being processed in the subsequent code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.concat(...urlMap.values())
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to concatenate the values of the `urlMap` into a single array, which is not the intended operation and could lead to a flattened structure rather than an array of objects.

DONE.
