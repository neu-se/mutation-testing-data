  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.encoding
```
This change will cause the `readFile` function to use the `encoding` property of the `options` object as the encoding for the file, rather than the default encoding.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.throws
```
This change will cause the `readFile` function to use the `throws` property of the `options` object as the error handling strategy, rather than the default strategy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, options.reviver
```
This change will cause the `readFile` function to use the `reviver` property of the `options` object as the JSON reviver function, rather than the default reviver function.

DONE.
