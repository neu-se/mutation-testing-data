  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of the array, whereas `push` adds a new element to the end of the array. In this case, `pop` would cause the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array to be empty, even if there are still unhandled rejections.

DONE.
