  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error2'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is no longer 'error', which could cause the application to behave differently when an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is no longer 'error', which could cause the application to behave differently when an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'disconnect'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is no longer 'error', which could cause the application to behave differently when an error occurs.

DONE.
