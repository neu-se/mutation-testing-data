  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.src
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.src` is a different variable than `options.dest`, and it may not be set to a valid file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would convert the file path to uppercase, which may not be valid or expected by the code that uses the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory name of the file path, which may not be the same as the original file path.

DONE.
