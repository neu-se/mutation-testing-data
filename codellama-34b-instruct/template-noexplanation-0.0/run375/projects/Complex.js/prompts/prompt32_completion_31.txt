  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the inequality operator instead of the equality operator. This change will cause the function to return a different value when `a` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the greater-than operator instead of the equality operator. This change will cause the function to return a different value when `a` is greater than zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the less-than operator instead of the equality operator. This change will cause the function to return a different value when `a` is less than zero.

DONE.
