 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately calls the function, instead of passing the function reference. This means that the `nodeArgs.push` call would receive the return value of `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` instead of the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the function reference with `null`. The `nodeArgs.push` call would then push `null` as the last argument, which would likely cause the method being called to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the function reference with the `deferred` object. The `nodeArgs.push` call would then push the `deferred` object as the last argument, which would likely cause the method being called to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
