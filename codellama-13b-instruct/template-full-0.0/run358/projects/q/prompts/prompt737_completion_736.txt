  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, regardless of whether the input array is empty or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise, regardless of whether the input array is empty or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a rejected promise if the input array has more than one element, and a fulfilled promise if the input array has only one element.

DONE.
