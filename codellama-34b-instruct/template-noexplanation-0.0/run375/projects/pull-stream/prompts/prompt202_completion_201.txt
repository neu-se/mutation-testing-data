  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` instead of the expected `abort` error. This will likely cause the test to fail, as the `abortCb` function is expecting an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `undefined` instead of the expected `abort` error. This will likely cause the test to fail, as the `abortCb` function is expecting an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('abort')
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with a new error object instead of the expected `abort` error. This will likely cause the test to fail, as the `abortCb` function is expecting an error object.

DONE.
