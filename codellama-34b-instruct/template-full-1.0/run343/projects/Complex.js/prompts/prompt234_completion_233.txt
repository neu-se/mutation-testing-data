  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a >= 0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has an equality check  ```a <= 0``` which means ```a``` can be zero and ```b``` can be positive, but the new code ```a >= 0``` makes ```b``` negative when ```a``` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```b != 0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a conditional statement, but the new code only checks if ```b``` has any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a > 0 || b == 0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has an or check ```||```  and the new code is only checking for a greater than equality ```>=```.

DONE.
