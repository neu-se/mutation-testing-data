Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load('invalid/path/to/file.json');
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to load a file from a non-existent path, which would trigger the 'error' event in the `_readStream` and potentially lead to unhandled errors if not properly tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would cause the `_load` method to skip the file loading logic and immediately emit a 'load' event with a count of 0, which may not be the intended behavior if the path is expected to be a valid string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` would also skip the file loading logic, but it may lead to confusion in the code's intent, as it is not clear whether the absence of a path is intentional or an oversight, potentially affecting the application's state.

DONE.
