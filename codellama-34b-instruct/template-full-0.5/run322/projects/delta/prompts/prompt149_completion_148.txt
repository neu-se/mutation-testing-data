  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` is greater than 0, which means that there is a remaining length to be processed. In contrast, the new code fragment checks if the difference is less than 0, which means that there is a negative length remaining, which is not a valid condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the difference between `firstOther.retain` and `firstLeft` is greater than 0, which means that there is a remaining length to be processed. In contrast, the new code fragment checks if the difference is equal to 0, which means that there is no remaining length, and the code would not process any more ops.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
