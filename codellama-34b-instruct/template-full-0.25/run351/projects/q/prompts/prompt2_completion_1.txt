  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because "promise" is a string, whereas `bootstrap` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"q"
```
This would result in different behavior because "q" is a string, whereas `bootstrap` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"function"
```
This would result in different behavior because "function" is a string, whereas `bootstrap` is a function.

DONE.
