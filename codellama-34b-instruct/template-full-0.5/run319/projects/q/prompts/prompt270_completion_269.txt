  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `null` would cause the promise to be rejected without a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `undefined` would cause the promise to be rejected without a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` expects a reason for the rejection, and passing a string would cause the promise to be rejected with a reason.

DONE.
