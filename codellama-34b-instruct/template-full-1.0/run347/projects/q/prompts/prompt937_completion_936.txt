  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return the entire `baseArgs` array instead of slicing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return all elements of the `baseArgs` array except for the last one, instead of returning all elements from the second element onwards.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return all elements of the `baseArgs` array, including the `thisp` argument.

DONE.
