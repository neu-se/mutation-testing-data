  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor.name` returns the name of the constructor function used to create the object, whereas `typeof a` returns the type of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.toString()` returns a string representation of the object, whereas `typeof a` returns the type of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.valueOf()` returns the primitive value of the object, whereas `typeof a` returns the type of the object.

DONE.
