  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) >= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is less than `EPSILON`, while the new code checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `EPSILON`. This would cause the `toString` method to produce different results for complex numbers with a magnitude less than `EPSILON`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is less than `EPSILON`, while the new code checks if `b` is greater than or equal to `EPSILON`. This would cause the `toString` method to produce different results for complex numbers with an imaginary part less than `EPSILON`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
