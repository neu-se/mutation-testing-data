  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `Q.nfapply` would be passed to the Node function as an argument, rather than being used as the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `Q.nfapply` would be passed to the Node function as an argument, rather than being used as the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 4
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth argument to `Q.nfapply` would be passed to the Node function as an argument, rather than being used as the callback.

DONE.
