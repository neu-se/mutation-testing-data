  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(word)` is a function that returns a string representing the type of an object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `word.constructor.name` is a property that returns the name of the constructor function that created an object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

DONE.
