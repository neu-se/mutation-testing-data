  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(null)` creates a new function that always uses `null` as the `this` value when called, whereas the original code uses the `deferred` object as the `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function creates a new function that calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` only when the arrow function is called, whereas the original code calls `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` at the time of function creation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind(deferred)` creates a new function that uses `deferred` as the `this` value when called, whereas the original code uses the original `this` value (the `deferred`
