  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `array` is an array, but `array.length` is a number, so the `map` function would not be applied to the array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while the original code fragment `array` is the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.concat([])` returns a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and an empty array, while the original code fragment `array` is the original array.

DONE.
