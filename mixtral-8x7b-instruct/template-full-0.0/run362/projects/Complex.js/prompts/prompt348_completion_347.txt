 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces randomness in the calculation, making the output unpredictable and inconsistent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the input `b`, changing the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the exponential of `b`, which is not the same as the original value of `b`.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing process highlights potential weaknesses in the test suite, as the tests should fail due to the altered behavior. DONE.
