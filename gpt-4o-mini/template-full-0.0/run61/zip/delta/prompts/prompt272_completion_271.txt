Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to terminate when there are no more operations to iterate over, effectively skipping any remaining operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the loop condition to only continue if the next operation is a delete, potentially ignoring insert and retain operations that should also be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue as long as there are operations with a length greater than zero, which could lead to processing operations that should not be considered if they are empty.

DONE.
