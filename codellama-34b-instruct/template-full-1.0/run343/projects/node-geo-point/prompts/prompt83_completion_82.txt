  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var a = 1, b = 2;
function foo(x) {
  return x + a;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PI = Math.PI + 1;
console.log(PI);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is not modified in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function foo(x) {
  return x + 1;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `foo` function is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
