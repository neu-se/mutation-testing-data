  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the current GeoPoint object, while the new code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the current GeoPoint object, while the new code fragment returns a new GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude set to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.fromLatLngArray([0, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the current GeoPoint object, while the new code fragment returns a new GeoPoint object created from the [0, 0] array.

DONE.
