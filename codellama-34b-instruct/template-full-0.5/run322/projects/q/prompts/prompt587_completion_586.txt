  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator()).then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the return value of `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which is a promise. In the original code, the `makeGenerator` function is called directly, and its return value is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function is called directly, and its return value is not a promise. In the original code, the `Q.async` function is called with `makeGenerator` as an argument, and its return value is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the return value of `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which is a promise. In the original
