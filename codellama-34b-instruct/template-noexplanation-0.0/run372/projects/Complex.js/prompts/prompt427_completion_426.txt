  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This will cause the `Math.pow` function to return 0, which will result in the `places` variable being set to 0. This will cause the `Math.ceil` function to round the `re` and `im` components of the complex number to 0, which will result in the `Complex` object being set to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This will cause the `Math.pow` function to return -1, which will result in the `places` variable being set to -1. This will cause the `Math.ceil` function to round the `re` and `im` components of the complex number to -1, which will result in the `Complex` object being set to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This will cause the `Math.pow` function to return Infinity, which will result in the `places
