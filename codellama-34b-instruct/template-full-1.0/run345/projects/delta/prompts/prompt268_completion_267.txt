  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, whereas `otherOp` refers to an object that holds the opposite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseFloat` returns the argument as a floating point number, whereas `otherOp` may contain an integer or string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of the argument, whereas `otherOp` may contain a negative value.

DONE.
