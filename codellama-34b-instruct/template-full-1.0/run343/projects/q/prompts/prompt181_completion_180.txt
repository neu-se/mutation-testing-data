  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^at (?:.+ )?\((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `(?:.+ )?` part would match any number of characters, including none, before the function name, which is not part of the original regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^at .+ \((.+)(?::(\d+))(?::(\d+))?\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `(?::(\d+))?` part would make the column number optional, which is not the case in the original regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^at .+ \((.+):(\d+):(?:\d+)\)$/.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because the `(?:\d+)` part would match any number of digits, including none, before the column number
