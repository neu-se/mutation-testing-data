  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` expects a file path as its argument, while `zipArchive.directory` expects a directory path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob('**/*')
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.glob('**/*')` would include all files and directories in the archive, while `zipArchive.directory` would only include the files and directories in the specified directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory('../')
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory('../')` would include the parent directory of the current directory, while `zipArchive.directory` would only include the files and directories in the specified directory.

DONE.
