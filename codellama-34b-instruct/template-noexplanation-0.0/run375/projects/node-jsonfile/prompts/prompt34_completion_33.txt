  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding
```
This change will cause the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions to read and write files with a different name than the one specified in the `file` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace(/\.json$/, '')
```
This change will cause the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions to read and write files with a different name than the one specified in the `file` parameter, by removing the `.json` extension from the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.replace(/\.json$/, '.txt')
```
This change will cause the `readFile` and `writeFile` functions to read and write files with a different name than the one specified in the `file` parameter, by replacing the `.json` extension with `.txt`.

DONE.
