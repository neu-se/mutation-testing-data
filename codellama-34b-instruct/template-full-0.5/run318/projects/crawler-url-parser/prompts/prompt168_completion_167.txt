  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `pageurl_path` starts with the substring `linkurl_path`, whereas `includes` checks if `pageurl_path` contains the substring `linkurl_path` anywhere.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice(0, linkurl_path.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` extracts a substring of `pageurl_path` starting from the first character and with a length equal to the length of `linkurl_path`, whereas `includes` checks if `linkurl_path` is a substring of `pageurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of `linkurl_path` in `pageurl_path`, whereas
