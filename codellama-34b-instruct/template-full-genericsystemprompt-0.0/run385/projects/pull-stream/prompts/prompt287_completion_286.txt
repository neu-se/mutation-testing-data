  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the transformed data, while the buggy code fragment returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the transformed data, while the buggy code fragment returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the mapper function with null, while the buggy code fragment does.

DONE.
