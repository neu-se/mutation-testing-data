  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from the second element onwards, instead of returning a new array containing the elements of `arguments` from the first element onwards.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    arguments.splice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first element of `arguments` and return a new array containing the remaining elements, instead of returning a new array containing all the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    arguments.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing only the elements of `arguments` that are not equal to `1`, instead of returning a new array containing all the elements.

DONE.
