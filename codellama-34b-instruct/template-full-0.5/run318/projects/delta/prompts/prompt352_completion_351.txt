  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other operation instead of the base operation, which could cause issues if the attributes are not the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the second argument to `AttributeMap.invert`, which could cause issues if the function does not handle `null` correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the attributes of the other operation as the first argument and `null` as the second argument to `AttributeMap.invert`, which could cause issues if the function does not handle `null` correctly.

DONE.
