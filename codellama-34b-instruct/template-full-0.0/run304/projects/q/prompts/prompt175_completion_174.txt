  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.reverse().join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the stack trace to be printed in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice(1).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, which would cause the first element of the array to be omitted from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.concat(["extra line"]).join
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method adds the specified element to the end of the array, which would cause an extra line to be added to the stack trace.

DONE.
