 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the next operation without advancing the iterator, which could lead to an infinite loop in certain conditions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.previous()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the previous operation, which is not equivalent to the next operation in the sequence. This could lead to incorrect diff results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.hasNext ? otherIter.next() : null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of a `hasNext` property, which is not a standard method for iterators. If the property exists, it returns the next operation; otherwise, it returns `null`. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the code.

DONE.
