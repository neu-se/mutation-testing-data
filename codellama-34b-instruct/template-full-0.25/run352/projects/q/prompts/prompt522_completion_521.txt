  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same properties and methods as the original `exception` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and it would not have the same properties and methods as the original `exception` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Error()` creates a new error object, which would have different properties and methods than the original `exception` object.

DONE.
