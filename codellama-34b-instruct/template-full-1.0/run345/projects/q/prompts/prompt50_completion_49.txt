  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` is a variable that is not defined in the context of the code snippet, and therefore the expression `!domain` would always evaluate to `true`, regardless of the value of `flushing`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
flushing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is a boolean variable, and adding 1 to it would cause it to always evaluate to `true`, even if its original value was `false`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
flushing = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the value of `flushing` to `false`, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
