  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolved` is a promise method that returns a resolved promise, whereas `rejected` is a promise method that returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method that returns a rejected promise, whereas `rejected` is a promise method that returns a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw new Error("rejected")` throws an error with the message "rejected", whereas `rejected` is a promise method that returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
