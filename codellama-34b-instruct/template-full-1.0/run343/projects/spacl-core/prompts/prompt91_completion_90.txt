  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through each policy and check if it is governed by the current policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through each policy and check if the length of the policies array is governed by the current policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would loop through each policy and check if the current policy object is governed by the current policy.

DONE.
