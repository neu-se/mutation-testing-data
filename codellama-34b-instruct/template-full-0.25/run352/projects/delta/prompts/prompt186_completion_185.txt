  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`. In JavaScript, `undefined` is a primitive value that represents an uninitialized variable or a non-existent property, while `null` is an object that represents the intentional absence of any object value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a number, and `thisOp.retain` is expected to be a boolean value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because `'retain'` is a string, and `thisOp.retain` is expected to be a boolean value.

DONE.
