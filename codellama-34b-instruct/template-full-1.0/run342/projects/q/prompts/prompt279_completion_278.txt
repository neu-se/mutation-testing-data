  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `arguments` object, which is not available in ES6 and returns a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `arguments` object to get the arguments passed to the function, while this code fragment uses the `arguments` object to get the arguments passed to the `reject` function, which is not the same thing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `arguments` object to create a new array with the arguments passed to the function, while this code fragment creates an empty array.

DONE.
