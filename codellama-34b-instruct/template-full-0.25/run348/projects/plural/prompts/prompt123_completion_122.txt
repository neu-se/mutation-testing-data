  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex to match all occurrences of the words in the list, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex pattern would cause the regex to match the words in the list regardless of their case, so "tea" would also match "Tea" and "TEA".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
