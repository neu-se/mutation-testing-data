  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is infinite, but the replaced code fragment checks if `z` is infinite and also if `z` is equal to the placeholder value. This would cause the code to behave differently in certain cases where `z` is infinite but not equal to the placeholder value.

DONE.
