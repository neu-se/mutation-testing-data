  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, which in this case is `undefined`. This means that the `error` object would be lost and the promise would be resolved with `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.catch()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch()` returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback, which in this case is `undefined`. This means that the `error` object would be lost and the promise would be resolved with `undefined`, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the returned promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error, promise.finally()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.finally()` returns a new promise that is resolved
