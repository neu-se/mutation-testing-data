  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred.reject).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the deferred promise, while `Q(callback).fapply` is a method that applies the `callback` function to the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(deferred.resolve).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred promise, while `Q(callback).fapply` is a method that applies the `callback` function to the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(timeout).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` is a numeric value representing the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the promise, while `Q(callback).fapply` is a method that applies the `callback` function to the promise.

DONE.
