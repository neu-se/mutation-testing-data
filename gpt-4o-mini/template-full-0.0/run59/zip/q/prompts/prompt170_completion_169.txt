Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `false`, leading to all stack lines being considered as non-internal, which could result in incorrect stack trace filtering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isInternalFrame` function to always return `true`, leading to all stack lines being considered as internal, which would prevent any relevant stack traces from being displayed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lineNumber > qEndingLine
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to only filter out stack lines that are greater than the `qEndingLine`, potentially allowing internal frames that should be filtered out to remain in the stack trace.

DONE.
