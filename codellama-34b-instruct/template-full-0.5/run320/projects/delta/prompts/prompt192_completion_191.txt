  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if `otherIter` has no more elements, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue even if `delta` has no more elements, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to continue for a fixed number of iterations, regardless of whether `otherIter` or `delta` have more elements.

DONE.
