  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 2, regardless of the values of `thisIter.peekLength()` and `otherIter.peekLength()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'hello' + 'world'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string `'helloworld'`, regardless of the values of `thisIter.peekLength()` and `otherIter.peekLength()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the number 42, regardless of the values of `thisIter.peekLength()` and `otherIter.peekLength()`.

DONE.
