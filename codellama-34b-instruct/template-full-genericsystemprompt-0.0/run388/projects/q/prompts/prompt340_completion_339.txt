  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "fulfilled", even if the promise was rejected, which would cause the `rejected` branch to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would never be "rejected", even if the promise was rejected, which would cause the `rejected` branch to be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspected.state` would always be "pending", even if the promise was fulfilled or rejected, which would cause the `fulfilled` and `rejected` branches to be skipped.

DONE.
