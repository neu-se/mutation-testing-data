  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x, y
```
This change reverses the order of the variables, which could potentially cause issues with the calculation of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y + x
```
This change adds the values of `y` and `x` together, which could also cause issues with the calculation of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This change subtracts the value of `y` from `x`, which could also cause issues with the calculation of the bearing.

DONE.
