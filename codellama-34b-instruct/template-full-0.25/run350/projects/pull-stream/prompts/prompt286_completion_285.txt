  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because `!end` is always truthy, whereas `end` is only truthy when it is not null or undefined. This means that the `try` block would always be executed, even when `end` is null or undefined, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end && mapper(data)` is only truthy when both `end` and `mapper(data)` are truthy. This means that the `try` block would only be executed when both `end` and `mapper(data)` are truthy, which could cause the code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end || mapper(data)` is only truthy when either `end` or `mapper
