  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `return` value of the `promiseDispatch` method would be `undefined`, which would cause the `dispatch` method to return a promise that resolves to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this.dispatch(deferred.reject, op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the `reject` method instead of the `resolve` method, causing the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
