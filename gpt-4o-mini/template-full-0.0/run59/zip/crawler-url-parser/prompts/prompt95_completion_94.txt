Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to be called with `null` as the base URL, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the `href` and resulting in a `currentUrl` that lacks a valid base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_base_url"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string that is not a valid URL to the `parse` function, which could lead to the function returning `null` or an incorrectly parsed URL, affecting the subsequent logic that relies on a valid `currentUrl`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object instead of the `baseUrl` object itself, which could lead to unexpected results if `baseUrl` is `null` or does not have a `url` property, potentially causing errors in the parsing logic.

DONE.
