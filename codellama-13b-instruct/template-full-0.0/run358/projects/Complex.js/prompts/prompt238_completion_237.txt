  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `b`, while the modified code fragment returns `b + 1`. This could cause issues in cases where the value of `b` is expected to be used in a specific way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `b`, while the modified code fragment returns `-b`. This could cause issues in cases where the value of `b` is expected to be used in a specific way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `b`, while the modified code fragment returns the absolute value of `b`. This could cause issues in cases where the value of `b` is expected to be used in a specific way.

DONE.
