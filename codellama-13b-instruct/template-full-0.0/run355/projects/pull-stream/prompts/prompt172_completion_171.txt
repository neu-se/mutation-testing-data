  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a function that always returns `true` when called, regardless of the `abort` parameter. This would cause the `values` function to always return an empty array, which could cause issues in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a function that always returns `false` when called, regardless of the `abort` parameter. This would cause the `values` function to always return an empty array, which could cause issues in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` function would return a function that always returns `true` when called, regardless of the `abort` parameter. This would cause the `values` function to always
