  Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:

```
err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true if `err` is not null, regardless of the length of `cbs`.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:

```
cbs.length && err != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true if both `cbs` has a length greater than 0 and `err` is not null.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:

```
!cbs.length && err == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate to true if both `cbs` has a length of 0 and `err` is null.

DONE.
