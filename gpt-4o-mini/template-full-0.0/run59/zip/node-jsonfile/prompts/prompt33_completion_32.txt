Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.appendFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.appendFile` appends data to a file instead of overwriting it, which could lead to unexpected results if the intention was to write new content.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.writeFileSync` is a synchronous method, which could block the event loop and lead to performance issues, especially in an asynchronous context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.unlink)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.unlink` is used to delete a file, which would cause the function to attempt to delete the file instead of writing to it, leading to errors or data loss.

DONE.
