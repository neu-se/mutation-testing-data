  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0 
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length <= 0` check in the original code fragment would catch cases where `length` is a negative number, while the new fragment would only catch cases where `length` is exactly 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0 
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length <= 0` check in the original code fragment would catch cases where `length` is 0, while the new fragment would only catch cases where `length` is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0 
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length <= 0` check in the original code fragment would catch cases where `length` is 0 or a negative number, while the new fragment would only catch cases where `length` is a negative number.

DONE.
