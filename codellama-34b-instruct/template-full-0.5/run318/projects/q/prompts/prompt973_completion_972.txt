  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(Q.nfapply, Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfapply` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(Q.nbind, Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is not a function and would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nfcall(Q.nfbind)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nfbind` is not a function and would throw an error.

DONE.
