  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index in this && this[index] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is in the array, but does not check if the value at that index is undefined. The modified code fragment checks if the value at the index is not undefined, which would cause the `array_reduce` function to behave differently if the array contains undefined values.
