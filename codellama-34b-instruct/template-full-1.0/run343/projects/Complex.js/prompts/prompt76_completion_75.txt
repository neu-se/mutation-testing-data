  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<=` operator will allow the loop to continue to the next iteration even if the index is equal to the length of the `tokens` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== tokens.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator will not allow the loop to continue to the next iteration if the index is equal to the length of the `tokens` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== tokens.length || parser_exit()
```
This would result in different behavior because if the index is equal to the length of the `tokens` array, the `parser_exit()` function would be called, which would cause the loop to exit.

DONE.
