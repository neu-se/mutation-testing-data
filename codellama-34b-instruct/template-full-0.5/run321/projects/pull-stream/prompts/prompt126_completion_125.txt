  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is less than `max`. This would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is greater than or equal to `max`. This would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i === max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while this replacement checks if `i` is equal to `max`. This would cause the function to return a different value in some cases.

DONE.
