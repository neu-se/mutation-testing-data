  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a valid key in the `Map` object, and attempting to retrieve a value using an invalid key will return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is a valid key in the `Map` object, and attempting to retrieve a value using a `null` key will return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `'key'` is a valid key in the `Map` object, and attempting to retrieve a value using the string `'key'` will return the value associated with the key `'key'` in the `Map` object.

DONE.
