  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the protocol from the URL, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the protocol with `http://`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedBaseUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the protocol with `https://`, which could cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

DONE.
