  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < -b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `x` is negative, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` when `x` is negative, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `x` is negative, regardless of the value of `b`.

DONE.
