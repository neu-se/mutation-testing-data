  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `a` variable, which is the real part of the complex number, while the new code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is the imaginary part of the complex number. This would cause the `sin` function to return a different value, which would in turn affect the calculation of the `tan` function.

DONE.
