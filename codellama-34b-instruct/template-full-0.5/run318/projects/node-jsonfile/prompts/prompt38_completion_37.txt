  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different method than `universalify.fromCallback`. The former takes a promise as input, while the latter takes a callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `fs.writeFile` function as a callback to `universalify.fromCallback`, rather than passing the `fs.writeFile` function directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `options` object as a second argument to `universalify.fromCallback`, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
