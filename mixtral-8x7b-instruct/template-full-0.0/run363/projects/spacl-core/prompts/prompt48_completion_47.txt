 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes `null` instead of an empty string to the `props` array, potentially causing issues in the code that relies on the `props` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
window.props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the global `window.props` array instead of the local `props` array, causing the pushed value to be lost or cause unexpected side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('/(' + part.slice(1) + ')')
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the wrong string format to the `parts` array, changing the regular expression structure and causing incorrect path matching.

DONE.
