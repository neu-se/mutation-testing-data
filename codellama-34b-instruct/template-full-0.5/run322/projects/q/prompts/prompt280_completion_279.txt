  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method with an argument of `1` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code returned the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method with an argument of `-1` would return a new array with the last element removed, whereas the original code returned the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method with arguments of `0` and `1` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas the original code returned the original array.

DONE.
