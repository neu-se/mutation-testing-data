  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.done: Unhandled rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of logging a warning, which could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Q.done: Unhandled rejection");
throw new Error("Q.done: Unhandled rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a warning message to the console before throwing an error, which could help debug the issue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(new Error("Q.done: Unhandled rejection"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `Q.onerror` function with the error message, which could be used to handle the error in a custom way.

DONE.
