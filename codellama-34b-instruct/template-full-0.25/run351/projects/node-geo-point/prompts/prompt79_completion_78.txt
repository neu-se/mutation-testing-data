  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a modified latitude value, which would lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use a modified longitude value, which would lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
