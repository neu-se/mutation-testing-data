  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` is used to indicate that the promise is resolved with `undefined` as the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` is used to indicate that the promise is resolved with `undefined` as the value, while `null` would indicate that the promise is resolved with `null` as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `void 0` is used to indicate that the promise is resolved with `undefined` as the value, while the string `"undefined"` would indicate that the promise is resolved with the string `"undefined"` as the value.

DONE.
