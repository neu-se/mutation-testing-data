Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because it would match words ending in "-y" but not "-ey" or "-ly" as the original rule did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y$|quy$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 4) + 'ies' }
