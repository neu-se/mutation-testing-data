  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'], this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `atan2` function are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'], this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `atan2` function are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `atan2` function are different, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
