  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/[aeiouy]/, 'a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all vowels in the word with the letter "a", which would change the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/[aeiouy]/, 'e')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all vowels in the word with the letter "e", which would change the plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/[aeiouy]/, 'i')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all vowels in the word with the letter "i", which would change the plural form of the word.

DONE.
