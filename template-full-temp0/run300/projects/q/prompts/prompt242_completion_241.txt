  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` would be incremented by 1, which could cause the promise to resolve to a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` would be decremented by 1, which could cause the promise to resolve to a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` would be multiplied by 2, which could cause the promise to resolve to a different value than expected.

DONE.
