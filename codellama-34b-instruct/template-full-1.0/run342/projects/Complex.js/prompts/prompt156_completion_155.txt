  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isZero']()` always returns `true`, regardless of the value of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['isZero']()` only returns `true` if `a` is `0`, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `b['isZero']()` only returns `true` if `b` is `0`, regardless of the value of `a`.

DONE.
