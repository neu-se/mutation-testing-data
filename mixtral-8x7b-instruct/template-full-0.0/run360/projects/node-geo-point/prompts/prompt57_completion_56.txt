 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the bearing, regardless of the input coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the current object instead of the input coordinate's latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random value between 0 and 1, instead of the actual bearing.

DONE.
