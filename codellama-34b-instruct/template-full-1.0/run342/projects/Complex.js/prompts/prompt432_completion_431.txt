  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` returns the largest integer less than or equal to its argument, while `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the value of its argument rounded to the nearest integer, while `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` returns the value of its first argument raised to the power of its second argument, while `Math.ceil` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to its argument.

DONE.
