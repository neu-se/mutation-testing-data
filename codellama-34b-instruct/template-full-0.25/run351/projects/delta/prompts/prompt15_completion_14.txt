  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === undefined` checks if `a` is undefined, whereas `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== null` checks if `a` is not null, whereas `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof a !== 'undefined'` checks if `a` is not undefined, whereas `typeof a !== 'object'` checks if `a` is not an object.

DONE.
