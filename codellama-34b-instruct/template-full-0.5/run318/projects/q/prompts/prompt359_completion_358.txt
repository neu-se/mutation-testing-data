  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value of the promise, while the mutated code returns null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value of the promise, while the mutated code returns undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the value of the promise, while the mutated code throws an error.

DONE.
