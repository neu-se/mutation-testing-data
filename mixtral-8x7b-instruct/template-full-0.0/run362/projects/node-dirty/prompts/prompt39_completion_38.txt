 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn(key, val) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `forEach` loop would no longer break when `fn(key, val)` is truthy, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn(val, key) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments of the `fn` function are switched, potentially causing the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fn.call(null, key, val) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to explicitly set the `this` value to `null`, potentially causing the function to behave unexpectedly if it relies on the `this` value.

DONE.
