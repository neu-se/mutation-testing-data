 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, [args]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `apply` method call by passing `args` as an array instead of individual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `arguments` object instead of the explicitly passed `args` array, which could lead to unexpected results in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `this` context of the function to `null`, which might not be compatible with the intended functionality of the code.

DONE.
