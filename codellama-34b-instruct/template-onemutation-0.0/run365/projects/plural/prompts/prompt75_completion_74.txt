  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'die'`, which is a singular noun, while the new code fragment is `'dice'`, which is a plural noun. The pluralization function would return a different result for these two words.

DONE.
