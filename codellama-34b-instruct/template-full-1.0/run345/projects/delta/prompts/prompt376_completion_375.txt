  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the length of the next operation in the other iterator to the string 'insert', which would always evaluate to false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the next operation in the other iterator to the string 'insert', which would always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the type of the next operation in the other iterator to the string 'delete', which would always evaluate to false.

DONE.
