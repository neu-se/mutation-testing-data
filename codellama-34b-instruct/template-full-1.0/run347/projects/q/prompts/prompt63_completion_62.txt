  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because window and flush are not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because this refers to the global object, and calling flush as a method of the global object would not work as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, flush
```
This would result in different behavior because null is not an object, and calling flush as a method of null would cause an error.
