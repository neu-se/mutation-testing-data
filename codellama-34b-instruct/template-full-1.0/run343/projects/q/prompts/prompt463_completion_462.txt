  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the variable being accessed in the array indexOf function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.getUnhandledReasons()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function to access the unhandled reasons, instead of accessing the array directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all(unhandledRejections, reason).forEach(unhandledReasons)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function (Promise.all) and iterate over the unhandled rejections, instead of accessing the array directly.

DONE.
