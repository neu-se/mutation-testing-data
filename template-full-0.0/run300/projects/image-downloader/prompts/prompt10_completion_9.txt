  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last segment of the URL path, rather than the full path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first segment of the URL path, rather than the full path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/').slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last segment of the URL path, rather than the full path.

DONE.
