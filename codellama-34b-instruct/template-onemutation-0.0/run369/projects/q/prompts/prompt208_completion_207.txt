  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.

DONE.
