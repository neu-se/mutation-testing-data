Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, leading to unhandled promise rejections not being tracked correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the notify method instead of the resolve method, which is intended for progress notifications rather than fulfilling the promise, potentially leaving the promise in a pending state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, regardless of the original promise's state, which could lead to unexpected errors in the promise chain.

DONE.
