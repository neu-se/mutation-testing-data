 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'1'

This would result in different behavior because the `parse_exit` function would not be called even if an invalid string is provided. The `parse` function would return an object with `re` and `im` properties set to `0` and `1` respectively, instead of throwing a `SyntaxError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse_exit` function would not be called even if an invalid string is provided. The `parse` function would return an object with `re` and `im` properties set to `1` and `0` respectively, instead of throwing a `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse_exit` function would not be called even if an invalid string is provided. The `parse` function would return an object with `re
