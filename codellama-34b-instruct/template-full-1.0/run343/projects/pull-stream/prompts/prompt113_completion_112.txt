  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with `null` as the first argument, without passing the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err.message, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the error message as the first argument, without passing the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the callback function with the length of the cumulative data as the second argument, instead of the cumulative data itself.

DONE.
