  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then()` returns a new promise, while `promise` is an existing promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q()` wraps a promise or value in a promise, while `promise` is already a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer()` returns a new deferred object, while `promise` is an existing promise.

DONE.
