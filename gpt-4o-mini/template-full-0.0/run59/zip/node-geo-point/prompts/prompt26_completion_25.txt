Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the sine function instead of converting degrees to radians, which would lead to incorrect calculations in the distance formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude * (Math.PI / 180) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the result of the degree-to-radian conversion, which would skew the calculations and produce erroneous distance results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it mistakenly uses the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which would disrupt the intended calculation of the distance between two geographical points.

DONE.
