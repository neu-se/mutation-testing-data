  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) === null
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression, which may or may not be correct depending on the intended behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== null && part.match(/:.+/) !== undefined
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression, which may or may not be correct depending on the intended behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:.+/) !== null && part.match(/:.+/) !== undefined && part.match(/:.+/) !== ''
```
This change will cause the `compile` function to produce a different regular expression, which may or may not be correct depending on the intended behavior of the code.

DONE.
