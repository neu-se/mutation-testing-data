  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` property is not the same as the `options` object, and the `request` function would receive a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.dest` property is not the same as the `options` object, and the `request` function would receive a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.url + options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options.url` and `options.dest` properties are concatenated, which would result in a different URL being requested.

DONE.
