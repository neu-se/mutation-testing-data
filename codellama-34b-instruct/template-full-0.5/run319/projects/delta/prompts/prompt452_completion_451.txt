  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `hasNext` method, causing the `next` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more operations to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `hasNext` method without checking its return value, causing the `next` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more operations to be processed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext && this.index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there are more operations to be processed and if the current index is less than the length of the `ops` array, causing the `next` method to always return an empty array if there are no more operations to be processed.

DONE.
