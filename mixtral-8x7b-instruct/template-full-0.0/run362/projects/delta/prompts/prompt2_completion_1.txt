 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat empty objects and null values differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat arrays and non-object values differently than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat undefined values differently than the original code fragment.

By introducing these changes, you can test the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior due to different input types and values. DONE.
