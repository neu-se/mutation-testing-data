 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles unhandled errors in promises, while `console.error` just logs the error. This would cause any unhandled errors to be silently ignored instead of being logged.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would disable the error handling mechanism for promises. Any unhandled errors would not be handled and could cause the application to crash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function (e) { return e; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the error handling mechanism for promises. Instead of handling the errors, it would simply return the error object, which could cause the application to continue executing with an unhandled error.

DONE.
