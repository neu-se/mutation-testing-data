  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value passed to `fulfill`, rather than resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value passed to `fulfill`, rather than rejecting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q.reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the value passed to `fulfill`, rather than resolving it.

DONE.
