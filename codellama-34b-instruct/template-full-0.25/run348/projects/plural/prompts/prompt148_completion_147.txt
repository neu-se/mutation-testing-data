  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, regardless of the word's actual plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 'es' to the end of the word, regardless of the word's actual plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.substr(0, word.length - 1) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 'ies' to the end of the word, regardless of the word's actual plural form.

DONE.
