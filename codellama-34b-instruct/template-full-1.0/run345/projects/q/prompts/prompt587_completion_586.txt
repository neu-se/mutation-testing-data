  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator.bind(null))
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator` would no longer be called with the correct `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because a different function would be called as the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because a different type of function would be called as the generator.

DONE.
