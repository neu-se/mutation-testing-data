  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2, zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with two arguments, resulting in a different calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a single argument, resulting in a different calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function would be called with a different argument, resulting in a different calculation.

DONE.
