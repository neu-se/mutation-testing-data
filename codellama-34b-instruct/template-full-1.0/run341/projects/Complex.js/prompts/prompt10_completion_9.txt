  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the square of the input, rather than the input itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to divide by zero, resulting in a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return Infinity, rather than the input itself.

DONE.
