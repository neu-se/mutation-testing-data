  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex is removed, causing the regex to be case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex causes the regex to match all occurrences in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex causes the regex to match the input string across multiple lines.

DONE.
