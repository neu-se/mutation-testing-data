 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(string,'').endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the string to a non-empty string using concat, which could cause the endsWith method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
string.slice(-1) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the last character of the string is a '/', instead of checking if the string ends with '/'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
string.indexOf('/', string.length - 1) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string contains a '/' at the second to last position, instead of checking if the string ends with '/'.

DONE.
