  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement `i` instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 2 instead of 1, potentially causing the loop to skip over certain iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would increment `i` by 1, but the assignment would be done using a different operator, potentially causing the loop to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
