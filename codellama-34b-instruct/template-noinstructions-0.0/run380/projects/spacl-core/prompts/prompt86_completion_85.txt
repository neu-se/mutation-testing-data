  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is not being called, which would cause the `Policy` to be created with a reference to the original `Rule` instead of a clone of the `Rule`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(name, deep)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method is being called with the wrong number of arguments, which would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
