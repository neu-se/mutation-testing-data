 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Reflect.ownKeys
```
This would result in different behavior because `Reflect.ownKeys` returns an array of all own keys in the object, including symbols, while `Object.keys` only returns the enumerable string-keyed properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
['constructor', ...Object.keys(b)]
