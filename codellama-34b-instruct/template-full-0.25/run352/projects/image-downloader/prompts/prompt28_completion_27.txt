  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight().startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` removes characters from the end of the string, while `trimLeft()` removes characters from the beginning of the string. This means that the resulting string after `trimRight()` may not match the original string, and the `startsWith()` method may return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` removes the first character of the string, which may change the result of the `startsWith()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.substring(1).startsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` returns a substring starting from the second character of the string, which may change the result of the `startsWith()` method.

DONE.
