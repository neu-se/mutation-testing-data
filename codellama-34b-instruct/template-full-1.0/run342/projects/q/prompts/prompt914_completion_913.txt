  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `arguments` and would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `arguments` and would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because an array with different values than `arguments` would cause the `nfapply` and `nfcall` methods to behave differently.

DONE.
