  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra space to the result of JSON.stringify, which could affect the formatting of the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spaces / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it halves the value of spaces, which could affect the amount of indentation in the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the result of JSON.stringify to be formatted with zero spaces, which could affect the readability of the output.

DONE.
