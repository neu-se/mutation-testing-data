  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr.startsWith('http://')) {
  baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is done using `startsWith()` instead of a regular expression, which could lead to different matching behavior for URLs that start with `http://`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr === '') {
  baseUrlStr = 'https://' + baseUrlStr;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is done using the identity operator `===` instead of a regular expression, which could lead to different matching behavior for URLs that start with `http://`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (baseUrlStr.includes('http://')) {
  baseUrlStr = baseUrlStr.replace('http://', 'https://');
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement is done using
