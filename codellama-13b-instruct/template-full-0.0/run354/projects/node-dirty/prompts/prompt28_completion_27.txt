  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write buffer is empty, while the 'close' event is emitted when the stream is closed. In this case, the 'close' event would be emitted immediately after the 'drain' event, which could cause the stream to be closed before the write buffer is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event is emitted when the write buffer is empty, while the 'end' event is emitted when the stream is closed and there is no more data to be written. In this case, the 'end' event would be emitted immediately after the 'drain' event, which could cause the stream to be closed before the write buffer is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain' event
