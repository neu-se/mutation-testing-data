  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `read`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `read`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code fragment, which was `read`.

DONE.
