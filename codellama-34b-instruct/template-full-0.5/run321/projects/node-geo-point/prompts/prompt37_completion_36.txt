  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` is the radius of the first point, while `point2Rad` is the radius of the second point. Using `point1Rad` instead of `point2Rad` would cause the calculation to use the wrong radius, leading to an incorrect distance calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the radius of the second point, causing the calculation to use a different radius than the original code. This could lead to a different distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad + point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the radii of the two points together, causing the calculation to use a different radius than the original code. This could lead to a different distance calculation.

DONE.
