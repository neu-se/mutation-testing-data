  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "es" to the word, while this code fragment appends "s".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "s" to the word, while this code fragment appends "es".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment appends "es" to the word, while this code fragment appends "ies".

DONE.
