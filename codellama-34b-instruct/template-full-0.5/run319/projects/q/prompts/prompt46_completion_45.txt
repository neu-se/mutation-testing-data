  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exit()` would terminate the Node.js process, whereas the original code would only exit the current domain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exitCode = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.exitCode` sets the exit code for the Node.js process, whereas the original code would only exit the current domain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.kill(process.pid);
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.kill()` would terminate the Node.js process, whereas the original code would only exit the current domain.

DONE.
