  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This change will cause the `getNumStr` function to always return a string with a leading zero, regardless of the input value. This will result in incorrect offset strings being generated for some time zones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This change will cause the `getNumStr` function to always return a string with a trailing zero, regardless of the input value. This will result in incorrect offset strings being generated for some time zones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This change will cause the `getNumStr` function to always return a string with a rounded value, regardless of the input value. This will result in incorrect offset strings being generated for some time zones.

DONE.
