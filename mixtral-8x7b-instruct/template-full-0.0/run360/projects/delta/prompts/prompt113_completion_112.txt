 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], this.ops.reduce)
```
This would result in different behavior because it applies `reduce` to each element of `this.ops` array instead of the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op).reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters out `falsy` values from `this.ops` array before applying `reduce`, which could lead to different accumulated values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.reduce.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) of the `reduce` function to the current object, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the function relies on the original context.

DONE.
