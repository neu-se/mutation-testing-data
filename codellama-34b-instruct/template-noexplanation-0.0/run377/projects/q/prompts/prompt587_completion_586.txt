  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { throw new Error("Test error"); });
```
This code fragment will cause the `makeGenerator` function to be called, and then a `Test error` will be thrown. This will cause the promise returned by `Q.async` to be rejected, which will in turn cause the promise returned by `spawn` to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { return Q.reject("Test error"); });
```
This code fragment will cause the `makeGenerator` function to be called, and then a rejected promise with the value `"Test error"` will be returned. This will cause the promise returned by `Q.async` to be rejected, which will in turn cause the promise returned by `spawn` to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function () { return Q.resolve("Test error");
