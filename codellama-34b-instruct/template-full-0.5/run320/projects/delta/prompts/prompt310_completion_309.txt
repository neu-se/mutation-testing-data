  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{
  const delta = new Delta(this.ops.slice());
  if (other.ops.length > 0) {
    delta.push(other.ops[0]);
    delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops.slice(1));
  }
  return delta;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `return` statement, which would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of a `Delta` object.
