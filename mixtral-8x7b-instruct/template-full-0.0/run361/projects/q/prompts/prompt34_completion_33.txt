 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a function as the `task` argument, but it would receive `null` instead. This would likely cause an immediate error when `runSingle` is called in the `nextTick` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `runSingle` function expects a function as the `task` argument, but it would receive a number instead. This would likely cause an immediate error when `runSingle` is called in the `nextTick` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.Q
```
This would result in different behavior because `global.Q` is an object, not a function. The `runSingle` function expects a function as the `task` argument, so passing an object would likely cause an error when `runSingle` is called in the `nextTick` function.
