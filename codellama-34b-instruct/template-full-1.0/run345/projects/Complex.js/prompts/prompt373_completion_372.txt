  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not the same as the original `Math.cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not the same as the original `Math.cos` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is not the same as the original `Math.cos` function.

DONE.
