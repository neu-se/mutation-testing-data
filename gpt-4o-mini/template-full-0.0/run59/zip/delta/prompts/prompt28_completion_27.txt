Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than the keys, which would lead to incorrect iteration and potentially missing attributes in the inversion logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(base).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because filtering the keys to only those that start with 'a' would limit the attributes considered for inversion, potentially omitting valid attributes that do not meet this condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, which would require additional handling to access the keys correctly, leading to incorrect behavior in the inversion logic.

DONE.
