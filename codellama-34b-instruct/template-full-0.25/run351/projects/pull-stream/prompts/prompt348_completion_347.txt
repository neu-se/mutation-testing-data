  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.call(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that allows changing the value of `this` inside a function, and passing `null` as the first argument would cause the function to be executed in the global scope, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.bind(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, and the first argument is the value to be passed as the `this` parameter to the function. Passing `null` as the first argument would cause the function to be executed in the global scope, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.test.apply(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method
