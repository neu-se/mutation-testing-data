  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `exception`, which was a variable that was defined earlier in the code. Replacing it with `0` would cause the code to behave differently because it would no longer be a reference to the variable `exception`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `exception`, which was a variable that was defined earlier in the code. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to behave differently because it would no longer be a reference to the variable `exception`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `exception`, which was a variable that was defined earlier in the code. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to behave differently because it would no longer be a reference to the variable `exception`.

DONE.
