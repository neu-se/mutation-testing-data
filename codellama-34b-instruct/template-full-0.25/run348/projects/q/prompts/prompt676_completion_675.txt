  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, args, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the array, which would cause the `dispatch` method to behave differently.

DONE.
