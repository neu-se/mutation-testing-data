  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a different range of elements from the `base` Delta, which may result in a different output from the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length + 1
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a range of elements that includes the next element after the end of the range, which may result in a different output from the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This change will cause the `slice` method to return a range of elements that includes the previous element before the start of the range, which may result in a different output from the `invert` method.

DONE.
