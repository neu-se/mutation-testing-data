 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it no longer checks if `attributes` is an object and if it has any properties. It only checks if `attributes` is not `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes instanceof Object && Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `attributes` is an instance of the `Object` constructor, which excludes objects created using object literals or other constructors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
attributes && Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't check if `attributes` is actually an object. It would treat `null` and empty arrays as if they had properties, which might not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
