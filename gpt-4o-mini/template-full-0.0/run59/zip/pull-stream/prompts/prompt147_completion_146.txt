Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values, rather than its keys, which is what `Object.keys()` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of the object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs, instead of just the keys, which would lead to a different output format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(object).filter(key => key.startsWith('a'))
```
This would result in different behavior because this code filters the keys to only include those that start with the letter 'a', potentially omitting many keys that would normally be included by `Object.keys()`.

DONE.
