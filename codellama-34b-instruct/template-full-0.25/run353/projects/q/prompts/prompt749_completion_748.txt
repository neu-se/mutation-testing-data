  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise itself, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the index of the resolved promise, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progress
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the progress of the promise, rather than the value of the promise.

DONE.
