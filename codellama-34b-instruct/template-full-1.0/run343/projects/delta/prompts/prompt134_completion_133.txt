  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one iteration fewer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-10
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute 10 fewer iterations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta` is a variable that stores the result of the `reduce` operation, so it would never be equal to the current iteration index.

DONE.
