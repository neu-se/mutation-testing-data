Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.concat(other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `other.ops` array to `this.ops`, potentially resulting in a different order and number of operations in the resulting `Delta` object compared to slicing `this.ops`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, other.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only take a slice of `this.ops` up to the length of `other.ops`, potentially omitting operations from `this.ops` that are beyond that length, leading to a loss of data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => ({ ...op, attributes: null }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array of operations where all attributes are set to `null`, which could change how the operations are processed and composed, potentially altering the final output of the `Delta`.

DONE.
