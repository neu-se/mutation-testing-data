  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.concat` returns a new array instead of modifying the original array in-place like `this.rules.push`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.unshift` adds the rule to the beginning of the array instead of the end like `this.rules.push`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.rules.splice` can be used to add, remove, or replace elements in an array, while `this.rules.push` only adds elements to the end of an array.

DONE.
