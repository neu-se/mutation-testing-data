  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1; i <= this.length; i++
```
This change will cause the loop to start at 1 instead of 0, which may cause the loop to skip the first element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length - 1; i++
```
This change will cause the loop to end at the second-to-last element in the array instead of the last element, which may cause the loop to skip the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0; i < this.length / 2; i++
```
This change will cause the loop to end at half the length of the array instead of the full length, which may cause the loop to skip over some elements.

DONE.
