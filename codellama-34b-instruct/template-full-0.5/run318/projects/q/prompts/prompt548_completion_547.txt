  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so `verb` would be set to "throw" and `arg` would be set to `null`, which would cause the `errback` function to be called with `null` as its argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, so `verb` would be set to "throw" and `arg` would be set to `undefined`, which would cause the `errback` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `errback` function to be called with an `Error` object as its argument, which would be handled differently than the original code.

DONE.
