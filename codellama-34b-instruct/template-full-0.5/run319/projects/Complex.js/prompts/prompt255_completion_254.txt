  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would always be greater than `a`, which could cause the `expm1` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a - 1` expression would always be less than `a`, which could cause the `expm1` function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a * 2` expression would always be twice the value of `a`, which could cause the `expm1` function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
