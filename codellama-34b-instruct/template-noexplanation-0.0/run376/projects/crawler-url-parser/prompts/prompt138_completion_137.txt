  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ''
```
This code fragment will remove the "index" part of the URL, but it will not replace it with a forward slash as the original code fragment did.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, ' '
```
This code fragment will remove the "index" part of the URL and replace it with a space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, 'default'
```
This code fragment will remove the "index" part of the URL and replace it with the string "default".

DONE.
