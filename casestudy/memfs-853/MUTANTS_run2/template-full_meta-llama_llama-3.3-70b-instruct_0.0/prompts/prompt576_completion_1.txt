Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('File already exists')
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a generic Error object instead of a custom error object created by the `createError` function, potentially affecting error handling and logging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
console.error('File already exists') && null
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs an error message to the console but does not throw an error, allowing the execution to continue instead of stopping with an exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.createError
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a potentially non-existent `createError` method of the current object (`this`) instead of the original `createError` function, potentially causing a TypeError or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
