 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the success callback would be called instead of the error callback when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the fail function would not be called and the error would not be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise object instead of rejecting it, and the error would not be passed to the next catch block.

DONE.
