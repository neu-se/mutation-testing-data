  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the object, which may have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the object with the object as the `this` context, which may have a different behavior than calling the method directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.apply(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the object with the object as the `this` context and no arguments, which may have a different behavior than calling the method directly.

DONE.
