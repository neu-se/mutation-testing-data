 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to call the `dispatch` method on the `Object` constructor, rather than the `Q` promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `dispatch` method of the current context, which might not be the `Q` promise object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `dispatch` method of a local `deferred` object, which is not part of the original code fragment's context.

DONE.
