  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` constant represents the ability to write to a file, whereas the original code fragment used `fs.constants.R_OK`, which represents the ability to read from a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.X_OK` constant represents the ability to execute a file, whereas the original code fragment used `fs.constants.R_OK`, which represents the ability to read from a file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.F_OK` constant represents the ability to check if a file exists, whereas the original code fragment used `fs.constants.R_OK`,
