  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] * loh - z['re'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the operands is reversed, which would cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh + z['im'] * arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is used instead of the `-` operator, which would cause the result to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * loh - z['im'] * arg + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional `1` is added to the result, which would cause the result to be incorrect.

DONE.
