  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than expected and any code that relies on the function's behavior would break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than expected and any code that relies on the function's behavior would break.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value than expected and any code that relies on the function's behavior would break.

DONE.
