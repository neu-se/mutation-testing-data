  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.includes(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if the callback is already in the list, and if it is, it will not add it again. In the original code, the callback is always added to the list, which could result in duplicate callbacks being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is checked instead of the `includes` method. If the list is empty, the callback will not be added, which could result in some callbacks not being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.indexOf(cb) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method checks if the callback is already in the list, and if it is not, it will add it. In the original code, the callback is always added to the list, which could result in duplicate callback
