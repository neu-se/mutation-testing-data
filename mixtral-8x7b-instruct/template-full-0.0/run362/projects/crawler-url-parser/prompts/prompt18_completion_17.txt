 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `false`, and the `baseUrlStr` variable would not be reassigned. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the reassigned value of `baseUrlStr`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would evaluate to `false` if `baseUrlStr` is `null`. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the reassigned value of `baseUrlStr`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true).host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would only evaluate to `true` if the current URL has a host. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that relies on the reassigned value of `baseUrlStr`.
