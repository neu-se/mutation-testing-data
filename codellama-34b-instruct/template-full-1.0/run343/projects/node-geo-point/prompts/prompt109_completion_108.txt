  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 << zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the left shift operator << would result in a smaller value than multiplying by two, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing by zoom would result in a floating-point value, while multiplying by two would keep the result as a whole number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 % zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulus operator % would result in a value that is always less than or equal to the zoom function, while multiplying by two would keep the result as a larger value.

DONE.
