Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to incorrectly handle the case where the first operation in `other` is a delete instead of an insert, potentially leading to unexpected results in the composition of the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the code to treat the first operation in `other` as an insert regardless of its actual type, which could lead to incorrect handling of operations and an invalid resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the logic to always consider the first operation's retain value as zero, which could lead to skipping necessary operations and altering the expected outcome of the delta composition.

DONE.
