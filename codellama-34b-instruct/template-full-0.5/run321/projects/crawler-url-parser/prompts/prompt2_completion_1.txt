  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.substring(1)` would return a substring of `str` starting from the second character, while `str` would return the entire string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.toUpperCase()` would return a string with all characters in uppercase, while `str` would return the string as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.replace("a", "b")
```
This would result in different behavior because `str.replace("a", "b")` would return a string with all occurrences of "a" replaced with "b", while `str` would return the string as is.

DONE.
