Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly use the second argument `b` instead of the first argument `a` to determine the embed type, potentially leading to mismatched types and errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the keys of `a` instead of the keys of the embed object, which may not correspond to the expected embed type, leading to incorrect type matching.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `embedType` to be `null`, which would always lead to a mismatch error when comparing with `Object.keys(b)[0]`, thus breaking the logic of the function.

DONE.
