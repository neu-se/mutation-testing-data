Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the fallback function to be called with `undefined` instead of the actual arguments, potentially leading to unexpected rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` would also lead to the fallback function being invoked, but it may not trigger the same error handling as `undefined`, resulting in different error messages or behaviors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unexpected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a string literal to the fallback function, which could lead to a rejection with a message indicating that the operation is not supported, even if the operation was valid.

DONE.
