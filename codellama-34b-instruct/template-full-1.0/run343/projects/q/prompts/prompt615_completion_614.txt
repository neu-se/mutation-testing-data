  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object with `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object with `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the object with `NaN`.

DONE.
