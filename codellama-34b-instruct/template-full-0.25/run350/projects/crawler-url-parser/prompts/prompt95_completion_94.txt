  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `url` property of the `baseUrl` object, which may not be the same as the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.protocol + '//' + baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would construct a URL string using the `protocol` and `host` properties of the `baseUrl` object, which may not be the same as the `baseUrlStr` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(baseUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `URL.format()` method to construct a URL string from the `baseUrl` object, which may not be the same as the `baseUrlStr` variable.

DONE.
