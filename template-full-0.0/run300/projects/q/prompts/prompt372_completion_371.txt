  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not used in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that is called when an error occurs, but it is not used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
