  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, while the new code fragment `onAbort()` calls the `onAbort` function immediately and passes no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, while the new code fragment `onAbort(abort, cb)` calls the `onAbort` function immediately and passes the `abort` and `cb` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onAbort` is a function that is called with the `abort` and `cb`
