  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will invert the boolean value of `abort`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `false`, and `false` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, and `abort` is a boolean value, so this expression will always evaluate to `false` if `abort` is `false`, and `true` if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort ? true : false
```
This would result in different behavior because the ternary operator will evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `true`, and `false` if `abort` is `false`.

DONE.
