 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies')
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method instead of the `+` operator for string concatenation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
w.replace(/y$/, 'ies')
