  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a bug");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute, while the mutated code would throw an error and stop execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute, while the mutated code would return early and stop execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would continue to execute, while the mutated code would return a different value and stop execution.

DONE.
