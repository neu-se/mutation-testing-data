  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```    
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid return value, but it is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a valid return value, but it is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that creates a rejected promise, but it is not a valid return value.

DONE.
