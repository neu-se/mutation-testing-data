  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `newPromise` is already a promise, so `newPromise.promise` would be a promise of a promise, which is not what we want.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `newPromise.value` would return the resolved value of the promise, which is not what we want.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newPromise.then(function (value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `newPromise.then` would return a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback function, which is the value of the original promise. This would result in the same behavior as the original code.

DONE.
