  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `2`, which would skip the first argument to `Q.fcall` and use the second argument instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 3)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `3`, which would skip the first two arguments to `Q.fcall` and use the third argument instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 4)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` is now `4`, which would skip the first three arguments to `Q.fcall` and use the fourth argument instead.

DONE.
