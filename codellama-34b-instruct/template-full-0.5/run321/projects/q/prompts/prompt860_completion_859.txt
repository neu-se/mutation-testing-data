  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would not be executed, and the promise would be resolved with the value `null` instead of being rejected with the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would not be executed, and the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of being rejected with the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error: Timed out after " + ms + " ms"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would not be executed, and the promise would be resolved with the string "Error: Timed out after " + ms + " ms" instead of being rejected with the error object.

DONE.
