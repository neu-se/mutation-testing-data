  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude value instead of the latitude value, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude value plus one, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the latitude value multiplied by two, which could cause errors in the code that uses the returned value.

DONE.
