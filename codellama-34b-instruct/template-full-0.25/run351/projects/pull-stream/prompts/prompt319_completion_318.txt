  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as an argument, which means that the `read` function will be called with `null` as an argument. However, if `undefined` is used instead, the `read` function will not be called, and the code will behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a falsy value, while `null` is a truthy value. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as an argument, which means that the `read` function will be called with `null` as an argument. However, if `false` is used instead, the `read` function will not be called, and the code will behave differently.
