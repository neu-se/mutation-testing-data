  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while the replacement code fragment `1 + 1` is a mathematical expression that evaluates to the number 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while the replacement code fragment `"hello world"` is a string literal that has no relation to the function's arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arguments` is a special keyword that refers to the arguments passed to a function, while the replacement code fragment `Math.random()` is a function that returns a random number between 0 and 1, which has no relation to the function's arguments.
