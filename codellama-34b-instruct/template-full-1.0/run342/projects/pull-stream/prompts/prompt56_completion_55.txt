  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.unshift(item)` would add the item to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.pop()` would remove the last item from the array instead of adding one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.splice(0, 0, item)
```
This would result in different behavior because `arr.splice(0, 0, item)` would add the item to the beginning of the array, but also remove the first item from the array.

DONE.
