 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the result of `Math.cos`, which can lead to unexpected values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `Math.cos` with `Math.sin`, which calculates the sine instead of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.PI / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `Math.cos` function with a constant value, which is the result of `Math.exp(Math.PI / 2)`. This change will cause the tangent function to always return the same value, regardless of the input.

DONE.
