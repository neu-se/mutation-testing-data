  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return value;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `value` variable is not defined in the scope of the `finally` callback, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback would return `null` instead of the resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` callback would return `undefined` instead of the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
