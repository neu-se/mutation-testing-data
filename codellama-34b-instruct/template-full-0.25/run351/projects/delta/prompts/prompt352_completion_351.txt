  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op instead of the base op, which could lead to incorrect results in the transform function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the same attributes for both the retain and the insert, which could lead to incorrect results in the transform function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other op for the retain and the attributes of the base op for the insert, which could lead to incorrect results in the transform function.

DONE.
