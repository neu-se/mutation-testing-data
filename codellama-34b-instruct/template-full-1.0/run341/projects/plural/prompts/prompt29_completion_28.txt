  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/thesis|crises/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is no longer case-insensitive, so the word "crises" would not match the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/(thesis|crises)/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'esis' });
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes an extra "s" at the end of the word "crises", which would cause the rule to not match the word "crisis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/^(thesis|crisis)/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'eses' });
```
