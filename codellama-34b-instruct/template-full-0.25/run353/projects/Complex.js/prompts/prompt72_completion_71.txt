  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is null, while this new code fragment checks if the `tokens` array has a length of 0. If the `tokens` array has a length of 0, it means it is empty, and the code would enter the `for` loop and try to access the first element of the array, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is null, while this new code fragment checks if the `tokens` array has a length of 1. If the `tokens` array has a length of 1, it means it only has one element, and the code would enter the `for` loop and try to access the second element of the array, which would cause an error.
