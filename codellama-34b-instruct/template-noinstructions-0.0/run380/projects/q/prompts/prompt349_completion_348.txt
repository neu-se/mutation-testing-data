  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the exception, while this new code fragment throws the exception, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the exception, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with the exception as the reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns the exception, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with the exception as the reason, using the Q library.

DONE.
