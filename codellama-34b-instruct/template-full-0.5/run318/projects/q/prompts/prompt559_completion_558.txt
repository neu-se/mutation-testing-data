  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks for the presence of the `StopIteration` symbol on the exception, while this code fragment checks for the presence of the `StopIteration` string in the exception's `name` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIterationException"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks for the presence of the `StopIteration` symbol on the exception, while this code fragment checks for the presence of the `StopIterationException` string in the exception's `name` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function checks for the presence of the `StopIteration` symbol on the exception, while this code fragment checks for the presence
