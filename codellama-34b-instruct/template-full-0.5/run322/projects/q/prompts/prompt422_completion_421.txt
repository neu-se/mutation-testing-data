  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `value` property of the `object`, whereas the original code fragment returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string representation of the `object`, whereas the original code fragment returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `object` if it is an array-like object, whereas the original code fragment returns the object itself.

DONE.
