Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, { someAttribute: true }, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the attributes object passed to the predicate, potentially altering the logic that depends on the attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the index passed to the predicate by incrementing it, which could affect how the predicate processes the lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it decreases the index passed to the predicate, which could lead to incorrect processing of the lines if the index is expected to be non-negative.

DONE.
