  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value + 1; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the fulfilled value of the promise, whereas the original code simply returns the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value * 2; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the fulfilled value of the promise by 2, whereas the original code simply returns the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function(value) { return value - 1; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the fulfilled value of the promise, whereas the original code simply returns the value.

DONE.
