  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
n
```
This would result in different behavior because the initial value of `i` is `0`, but after the loop, `n` would be `1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate `i + 1` times, instead of `i` times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
j
```
This would result in different behavior because a variable named `j` does not exist, and the loop would terminate immediately.

DONE.
