  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ics` ending would not be matched, resulting in incorrect plural forms for words such as "statistics" and "classics".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ic$|ci$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ics` and `ci` endings would be matched, resulting in incorrect plural forms for words such as "clothes" and "trouser".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/icate$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `icate` ending would be matched, resulting in incorrect plural forms for words such as "mitigate" and "authenticate".

DONE.
