  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0;` statement is valid but nonsensical in the current context. It would cause the `while` loop's condition to always be false, resulting in an infinite loop and the `reduce()` method not being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1;` statement is valid but nonsensical in the current context. It would cause the `while` loop's condition to always be true, resulting in an infinite loop and the `reduce()` method not being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN;
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid value for the `peek()` method. It would cause the `while` loop's condition to always be false, resulting in an infinite loop and the `reduce()` method not being called.

DONE.
