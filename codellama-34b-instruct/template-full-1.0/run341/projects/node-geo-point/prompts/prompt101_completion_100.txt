  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 0.005
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a small error in the latitude calculation, which could affect the overall result of the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 - 0.005
```
This would also result in different behavior because it would introduce a different small error in the latitude calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π/2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sinφ2` and `cosφ2` calculations to be equal to 1, which would change the result of the `calculateDestination` method.

DONE.
