  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `continuer` function itself as the first argument, which would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with the `continuer` function itself as the first argument, and the number `1` as the second argument, which would cause an infinite loop and also pass the number `1` as the `arg` parameter to the `continuer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", "error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on
