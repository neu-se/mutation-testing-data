  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + Math.PI) % (2 * Math.PI) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `rad2deg` to convert the angle from radians to degrees, while the new code fragment is using a different formula that first converts the angle to degrees and then adds `Math.PI` to it. This would result in a different bearing value, which could lead to incorrect calculations of distances and coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(θ + Math.PI) % (2 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using `rad2deg` to convert the angle from radians to degrees, while the new code fragment is using a different formula that first converts the angle to degrees and then takes the remainder with `Math.PI`. This would result in a different bearing value, which could lead to incorrect calculations of distances and coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
