  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression matches any sequence of digits, decimal points, and exponents, while the new regular expression matches any sequence of letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\d+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression matches any sequence of digits, decimal points, and exponents, while the new regular expression matches any sequence of digits.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression matches any sequence of digits, decimal points, and exponents, while the new regular expression matches any sequence of letters and digits.

DONE.
