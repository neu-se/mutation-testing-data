  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to call it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not behave the same as `deferred.makeNodeResolver`, which is a method that takes an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because `42` is a number and would not behave the same as `deferred.makeNodeResolver`, which is a method.

DONE.
