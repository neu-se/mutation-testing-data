  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'function' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `attributes` variable is a function, rather than an object. This would cause the `insert` method to always add the `attributes` property to the new op, even if it is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `attributes` variable has more than one key, rather than checking if it has any keys. This would cause the `insert` method to only add the `attributes` property to the new op if the `attributes` variable has more than one key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes != null &&
      typeof attributes === 'object' &&
      Object.keys(attributes
