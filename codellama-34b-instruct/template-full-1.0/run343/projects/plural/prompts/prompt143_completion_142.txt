  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is a unary operator that returns a string indicating the type of the operand, while `type` is an unknown variable or function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.type` is a different expression than `type`, and it has a different value if `this` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plural.type
```
This would result in different behavior because `plural.type` is a different expression than `type`, and it has a different value if `plural` is an object or function.

DONE.
