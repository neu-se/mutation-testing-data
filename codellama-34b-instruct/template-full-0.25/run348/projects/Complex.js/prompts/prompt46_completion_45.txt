  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a || 're' in a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if both 'im' and 're' are in a, while this code checks if either 'im' or 're' is in a.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a && 're' in b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if 'im' and 're' are in the same object, while this code checks if 'im' is in a and 're' is in b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'im' in a && 're' in a && a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if 'im' and 're' are in a, while this code checks if 'im' and 're' are in a and a is equal to b.

DONE.
