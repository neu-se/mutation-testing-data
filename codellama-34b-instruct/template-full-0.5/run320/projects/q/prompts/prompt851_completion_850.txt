  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with the error object, rather than rejecting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be returned as the result of the `then` method, rather than a promise that is rejected with the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be returned as the result of the `then` method, rather than a promise that is rejected with the error object.

DONE.
