Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` checks if the object has the specified property, either as its own property or as an inherited property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends!== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.extends!== undefined` checks if the `extends` property exists and is not undefined, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, regardless of its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.in instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `config.in instanceof Object` checks if the `in` property of the `config` object is an instance of `Object`, which is unrelated to the existence of the `extends` property, whereas `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call` checks if the object has the specified property as its own property.

DONE.
