  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the inserted text is always 0, which means that the code would always push an empty string to `delta`, instead of the actual text that was inserted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the inserted text is always 1, which means that the code would always push the first character of the inserted text to `delta`, instead of the entire text that was inserted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `text` variable instead of the length of the inserted text, which could be different depending on how the `text` variable is defined.

DONE.
