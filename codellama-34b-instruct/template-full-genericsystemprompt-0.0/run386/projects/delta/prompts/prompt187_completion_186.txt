  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `thisOp.insert` argument, which is not the same as the original code that called the `getHandler` method on the `Op` class with the `thisOp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta` class with the `otherOp.insert` argument, which is not the same as the original code that called the `getHandler` method on the `Op` class with the `thisOp` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(thisOp.insert, otherOp.insert)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getHandler` method on the `Delta`
