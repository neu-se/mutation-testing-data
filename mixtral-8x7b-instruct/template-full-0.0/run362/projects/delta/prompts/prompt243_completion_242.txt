 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns 0, which may cause the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly, especially when determining the length of the operation to delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(thisIter.current())
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the current operation, which may not be the correct length of the operation to peek at, causing the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10))
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random length between 0 and 9, which is unlikely to be the correct length of the operation to peek at, causing the `diff()` function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
