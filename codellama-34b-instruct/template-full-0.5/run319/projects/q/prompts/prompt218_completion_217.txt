  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Promise.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
