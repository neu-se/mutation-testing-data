  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to run one extra iteration, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never run, potentially leading to the loop body being skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1 < length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to stop one iteration earlier, potentially leaving out a necessary iteration.

DONE.
