  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is undefined, but replacing it with `null` would make the check always return `false`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is undefined, but replacing it with `undefined` would make the check always return `true`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `args` variable is undefined, but replacing it with an empty array would make the check always return `false`, potentially causing the function to behave differently.

DONE.
