  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[1]` would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of `ref[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[i]` would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of `ref[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref[length - 1]` would be passed as the first argument to the `pull` function, instead of `ref[0]`.

DONE.
