  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments of the path with a '/' character, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().map(s => s.replace(/[*+]/g, ''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any wildcard characters from the segments of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to match certain paths.

DONE.
