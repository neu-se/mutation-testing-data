  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks for deep equality, while `!isEqual` checks for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[key]` checks for the presence of a key in the `a` object, while `!a[key]` checks for the absence of a key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `b[key]` checks for the presence of a key in the `b` object, while `a[key]` checks for the presence of a key in the `a` object.

DONE.
