 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'Bogus error message'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original error message has been changed, which could cause issues in error handling or logging.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `DivideByZeroError` instead of the original `SyntaxError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Invalid Param')
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an `Error` object instead of a `SyntaxError` object.

DONE.
