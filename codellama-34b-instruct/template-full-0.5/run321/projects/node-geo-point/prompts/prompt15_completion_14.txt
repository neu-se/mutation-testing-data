  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the first element of the original array, rather than the original array itself. This could cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.concat([0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with the original array's elements followed by the elements of the argument array. In this case, the argument array is `[0]`, which would add an extra element to the end of the original array. This could cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to return a different result, potentially leading to errors in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method returns a
