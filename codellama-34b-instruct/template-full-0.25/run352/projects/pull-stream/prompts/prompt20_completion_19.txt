  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `ref` array is being passed as the second argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the third element of the `ref` array is being passed as the second argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the fourth element of the `ref` array is being passed as the second argument to the `pull` function, instead of the first element.

DONE.
