 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `i` by 2 instead of 1, causing fewer iterations in the loop and potentially skipping some elements in the `answerPs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
len++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments `len` instead of `i`, causing the loop to iterate more than expected and potentially accessing elements outside the `answerPs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new resolved promise, causing the `resolve` function to be called immediately and skipping the iteration over `answerPs` array elements.

DONE.
