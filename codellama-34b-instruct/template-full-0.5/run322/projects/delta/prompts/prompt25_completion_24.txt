  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] + b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` instead of comparing them for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] && b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a logical AND operation on `a[key]` and `b[key]` instead of comparing them for equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the values of `a[key]` and `b[key]` for inequality instead of equality.

DONE.
