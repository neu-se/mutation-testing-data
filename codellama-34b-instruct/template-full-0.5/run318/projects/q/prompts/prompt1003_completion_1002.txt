  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the `dispatch` method would be in the wrong order, causing the method to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method would remove the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.concat([42])]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method would add an extra argument to the `nodeArgs` array, which could potentially change the behavior of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
