  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("This is a different rejection reason");
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve("This is a different resolution value");
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolution value would be different, which could cause the test to fail.

DONE.
