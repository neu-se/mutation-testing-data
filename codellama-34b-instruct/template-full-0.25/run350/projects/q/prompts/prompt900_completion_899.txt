  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the function to throw an error, which would be caught by the promise and result in a rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the function to resolve immediately, without waiting for the promise to be resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err, result) {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but a function with two arguments is being passed instead. This would cause the function to resolve immediately, without waiting
