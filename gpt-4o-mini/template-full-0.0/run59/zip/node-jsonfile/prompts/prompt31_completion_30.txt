Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` to the `stringify` function may lead to unexpected serialization behavior or errors, as `stringify` might not handle `null` as a valid argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because using a hardcoded object with a specific encoding instead of the `options` object means that any custom encoding specified in the `options` will be ignored, potentially leading to incorrect file writing if a different encoding is required.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to the `stringify` function may cause it to behave differently than when passing the `options` object, potentially leading to serialization issues or default behavior that does not match the intended options.

DONE.
