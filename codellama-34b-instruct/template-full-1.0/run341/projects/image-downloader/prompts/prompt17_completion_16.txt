  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`options.dest = path.join(options.dest, basename);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `dest` path with the original `basename`, rather than the `decodedBasename`, which may produce a different file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.basename(options.url));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `dest` path with the `basename` of the `url`, rather than the `decodedBasename`, which may produce a different file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`options.dest = path.join(options.dest, path.dirname(options.url));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the `dest` path with the `dirname` of the `url`, rather than the `decodedBasename`, which may produce a different file path
