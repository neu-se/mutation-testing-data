  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values"
```
This would result in different behavior because "values" is a different method than "keys" and would return an array of the values of the object's properties, rather than the keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length"
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" is a property of an array, not a method, and would return the number of elements in the array, rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is not a valid method and would return an error, rather than the keys.

DONE.
