  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `new Complex(Math.PI / 2, Infinity)` for any non-zero value of `a` or `b`, even if `a` and `b` are not both zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `new Complex(Math.PI / 2, Infinity)` only if `a` or `b` is zero, but not if both `a` and `b` are zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 && b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return `new Complex(Math.PI / 2, Infinity)` only if both `a` and `b` are zero, but
