  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `stream` variable to `_read`, rather than the `read` function. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the `stream` variable as its argument, rather than the `read` function, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = read
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `read` function to `_read`, rather than the `stream` variable. This would cause the `nextChunk` function to be called with the `read` function as its argument, rather than the `stream` variable, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign `null` to `_read`, rather than the `stream` variable or the `read` function. This would cause the `nextCh
