  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would now include all attributes from the `b` object, even if they are `undefined`. This could cause issues if the `b` object is not intended to be merged with the `a` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would now include all attributes from the `b` object, even if they are `null`. This could cause issues if the `b` object is not intended to be merged with the `a` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] !== undefined && attributes[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose` function would now include all attributes from the `b` object, except for those that are `undefined` or `null`. This could cause issues if the `b` object is not intended
