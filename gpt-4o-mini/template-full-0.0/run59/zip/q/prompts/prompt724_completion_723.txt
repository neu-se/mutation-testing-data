Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the check for `isPromise(null)` will always return false, causing the code to skip the fulfillment check and potentially lead to an immediate rejection of the promise, rather than processing it as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise(undefined)` will also return false, similar to the first option, leading to the same issue where the promise is not processed correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior in promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to check if the promise at the current index is a promise, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promises if the array contains non-promise values, potentially resulting in incorrect fulfillment or rejection of the overall promise.

DONE.
