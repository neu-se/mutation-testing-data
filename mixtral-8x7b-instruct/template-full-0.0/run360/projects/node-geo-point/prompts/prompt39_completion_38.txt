 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad) * acos(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `<PLACEHOLDER>` with a constant value, which would not consider the actual longitude difference between the two points. This change would cause the distance calculation to be inaccurate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad) * atan2(point1.longitude, point2.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `atan2` function with the longitude values instead of the actual longitude difference. This change would cause the distance calculation to be inaccurate and potentially result in unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
cos(point1Rad) * sin(point2Rad) * Math.atan(point1.longitude / point2.longitude)
