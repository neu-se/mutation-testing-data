  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest.split('.').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `dest.split('.').join('')` would remove all periods from the destination file name, which may change its extension or validity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + dest
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 + dest` would concatenate the number 1 with the destination file name, which would result in a different file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would not produce any file output, whereas the original code fragment would write data to the destination file.

DONE.
