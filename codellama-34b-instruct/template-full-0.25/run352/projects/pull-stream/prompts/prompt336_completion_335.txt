  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment passes the string `"foo"` instead. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors or unexpected results.
