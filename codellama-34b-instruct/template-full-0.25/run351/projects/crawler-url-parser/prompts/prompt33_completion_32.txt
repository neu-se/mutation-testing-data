  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `http` protocol with `https`, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `http` protocol with `ftp`, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `http` protocol with `file`, which could cause the URL to be parsed differently.

DONE.
