  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.length` would return the length of the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.indexOf` would return the index of the first occurrence of the specified value within the stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.replace` would replace all occurrences of the specified value within the stack trace, whereas `e.stack.indexOf` would return the index of the first occurrence.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.stack.split` would split the stack trace into an array of strings, whereas `e.stack.indexOf` would return the index of the first occurrence.

DONE.
