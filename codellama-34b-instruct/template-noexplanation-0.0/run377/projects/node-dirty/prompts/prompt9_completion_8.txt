```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value `val * 2` instead of `val` in the `_data` map. This change will not affect the behavior of the `get` method, but it will cause the `size` method to return a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val.toUpperCase()
