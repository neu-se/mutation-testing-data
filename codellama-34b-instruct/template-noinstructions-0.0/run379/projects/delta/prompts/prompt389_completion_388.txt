  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` returns the `peekLength` property of the `otherIter` object, which is not necessarily related to the length of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength + 1` would always return one more than the length of the next operation in the `other` iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength` returns the actual length of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength - 1` would always return one less than the length of the next operation in the `other`
