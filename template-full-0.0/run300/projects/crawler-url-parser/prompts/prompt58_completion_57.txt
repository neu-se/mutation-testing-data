  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of the expected object, causing the `extract` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a URL object with a `protocol` property set to `null`, which would cause the `extract` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol != 'http:' && parsedUrl.protocol != 'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a URL object with a `protocol` property set to a value other than `http:` or `https:`, which would cause the `extract` function to fail.

DONE.
