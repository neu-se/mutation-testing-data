  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr + "test"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is modified, which could potentially cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.replace("http", "https")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is modified, which could potentially cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.split(".").reverse().join(".")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is modified, which could potentially cause the `parse` function to return a different result.

DONE.
