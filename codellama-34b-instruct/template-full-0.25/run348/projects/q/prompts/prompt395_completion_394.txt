  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` changes the `this` context of the function to `null`, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` changes the `this` context of the function to `this` and passes an empty array as arguments, which could cause the promise chain to behave differently.

DONE.
