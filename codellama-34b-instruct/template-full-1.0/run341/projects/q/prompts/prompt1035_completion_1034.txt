  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would not include the first argument passed to the function, unlike `array_slice(arguments, 0)` which includes all arguments starting from the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(args, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(args, 0)` would return the whole `args` array, unlike `array_slice(arguments, 0)` which returns a new array containing all elements but the first one of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs = array_slice(arguments, 1, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments, 1, 1)` would return an array containing the second argument of the `arguments` object, whereas `array
