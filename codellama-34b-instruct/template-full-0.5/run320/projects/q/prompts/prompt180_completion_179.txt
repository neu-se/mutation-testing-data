  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the stack trace line contains the string "(node.js:".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:123"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the stack trace line contains the string "(node.js:", but would instead check if it contains the string "(node.js:123".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:123:"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer check if the stack trace line contains the string "(node.js:", but would instead check if it contains the string "(node.js:123:".

DONE.
