  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abort` function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb && function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abort` function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `abort` function to be called with the wrong arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

DONE.
