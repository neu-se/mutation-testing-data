  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && !line
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!line` part would invert the result of the `isInternalFrame` and `isNodeFrame` checks, potentially causing the `filterStackString` function to include or exclude stack lines that it should not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.trim()` part would remove any whitespace from the beginning and end of the `line` string, potentially causing the `filterStackString` function to include or exclude stack lines that it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line.split(" ").length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `line.split(" ").length
