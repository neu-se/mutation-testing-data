  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This will cause the function to return the sine of the input angle instead of the cosine, which will result in a different output value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This will cause the function to return the tangent of the input angle instead of the cosine, which will result in a different output value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This will cause the function to return the arccosine of the input angle instead of the cosine, which will result in a different output value.

DONE.
