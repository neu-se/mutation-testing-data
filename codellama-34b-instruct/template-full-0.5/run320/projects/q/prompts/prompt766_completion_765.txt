  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would immediately resolve the promise, whereas the original code fragment `noop` would do nothing and the promise would remain pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would immediately reject the promise, whereas the original code fragment `noop` would do nothing and the promise would remain pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would create a new deferred object, whereas the original code fragment `noop` would do nothing and the promise would remain pending.

DONE.
