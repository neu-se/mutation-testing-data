  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
- 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign would flip the sign of the result, potentially producing incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+ 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra addend would change the result, potentially producing incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\* 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the extra multiplier would change the result, potentially producing incorrect calculations.

DONE.
