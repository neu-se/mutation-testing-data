 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset) / 30
```
This would result in different behavior because it would divide the offset by 30 instead of 60, which could lead to incorrect hour values in the output string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * 0.016666667
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the offset to minutes by multiplying it with a value close to 1/60, but not exactly, which could lead to rounding errors and incorrect hour or minute values in the output string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset >> 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would perform a right shift operation by 2 bits, which is equivalent to dividing by 4, not 60, leading to incorrect hour values in the output string.

DONE.
