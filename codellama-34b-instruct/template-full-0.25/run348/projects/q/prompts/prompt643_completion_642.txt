  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array is reversed, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat()` method creates a new array by concatenating the `args` array with an empty array, which could cause the `dispatch` method to interpret the arguments differently.

DONE.
