  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at the second element instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at the last element instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at a random element in the array.

DONE.
