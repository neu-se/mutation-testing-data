  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the less than operator, while the new code fragment uses the less than or equal to operator. This would cause the code to behave differently when the absolute value of `a` is equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`.

DONE.
