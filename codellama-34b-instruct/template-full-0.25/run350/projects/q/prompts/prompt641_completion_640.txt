  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the "get" operation instead of "post", which would cause the method to return a promise for the value of the property instead of the return value of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the "set" operation instead of "post", which would cause the method to set the value of the property instead of invoking the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the "delete" operation instead of "post", which would cause the method to delete the property instead of invoking the method.

DONE.
