  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `then` method would not be called if the promise is resolved with a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `then` method would not be called if the promise is resolved with a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because `"foo"` is a truthy value, and the `then` method would be called if the promise is resolved with a truthy value.

DONE.
