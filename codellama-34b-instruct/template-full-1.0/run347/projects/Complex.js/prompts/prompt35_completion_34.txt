  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the not equal operator `!=` is used instead of the equal operator `==`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `b` is `0`, leading to the `else` block being executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` used with the `b` variable would invert its value, making the `if` statement evaluate to `true` even if `b` is `0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `===` is used instead of `==`, which checks the value and type of the variables, so even if `b` has the value `0`, the type is different, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
