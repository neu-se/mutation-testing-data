 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be resolved, even if the input promise is rejected. This is different from the original code, where the returned promise's resolution depends on the input promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('An error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would always be rejected with the string 'An error', regardless of the input promise's state. This is different from the original code, where the returned promise's rejection depends on the input promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => reject('An error'), 1000);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected after 1 second with the string 'An error', regardless of the input promise's state.
