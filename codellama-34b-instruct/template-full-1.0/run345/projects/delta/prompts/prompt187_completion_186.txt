  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the getHandler function would return null, which would lead to a crash or error when attempting to call methods on the handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the getHandler function would return undefined, which would lead to a crash or error when attempting to call methods on the handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the getHandler function would return an empty object, which would lead to a crash or error when attempting to call methods on the handler.

DONE.
