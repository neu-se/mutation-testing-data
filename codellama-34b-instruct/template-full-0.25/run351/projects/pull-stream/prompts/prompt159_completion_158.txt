  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the value of `_value + 1`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the value of `_value * 2`, which is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `_value`, while the mutated code fragment returns the value of `_value - 1`, which is a different value.

DONE.
