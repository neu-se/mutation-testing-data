  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw newException
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the exception if the `Q.onerror` function is not defined, while the new code fragment would always throw the exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(newException)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only rejects the promise if the `Q.onerror` function is not defined, while the new code fragment would always reject the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(newException)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only resolves the promise if the `Q.onerror` function is not defined, while the new code fragment would always resolve the promise.

DONE.
