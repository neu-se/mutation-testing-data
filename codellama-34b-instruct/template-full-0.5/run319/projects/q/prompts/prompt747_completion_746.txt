  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not a function and will cause a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onRejected, onFulfilled, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` and `onRejected` arguments are swapped, which will cause the promise to be rejected even if it was fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onProgress, onRejected, onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onProgress` argument is passed as the first argument to `then`, which is not a valid argument and will cause a `TypeError`.

DONE.
