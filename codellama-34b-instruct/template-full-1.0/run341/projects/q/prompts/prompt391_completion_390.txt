  Sure, I can do that! Here are my mutation testing questions and answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will throw a `TypeError` when called as a function. In the original code, `progressed` is a function that is called with the `value` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a void expression that evaluates to `undefined`. In the original code, `progressed` is a function that is called with the `value` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(progressed(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a new resolved promise with the result of calling `progressed(value)`. In the original code, `progressed(value)` is a function that is called with the `value` argument, but the function
