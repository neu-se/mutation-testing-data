 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the key-value pair from the in-memory cache, but does not add the key-value pair to the write queue for persisting on disk.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the key-value pair to the write queue for persisting on disk, but does not update the in-memory cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the value associated with the key from the in-memory cache, but does not remove the key-value pair from the cache or add it to the write queue for persisting on disk.

DONE.
