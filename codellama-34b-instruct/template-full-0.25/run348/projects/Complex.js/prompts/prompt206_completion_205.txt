  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the real part of the complex number `z` (`z['re']`), while this replacement uses the imaginary part (`z['im']`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the real part of the complex number `z` (`z['re']`), while this replacement uses the real part plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b, z['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the imaginary part of the complex number `z` (`z['im']`), while this replacement uses the imaginary part plus one.

DONE.
