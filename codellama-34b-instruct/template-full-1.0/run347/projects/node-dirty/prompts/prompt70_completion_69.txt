  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which would indicate that the database file could not be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which would indicate that the database file could not be read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which would indicate that data could not be written to the database file.

DONE.
