  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `newOp.retain` to a non-null value, while this modified code sets it to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `newOp.retain` to a different value than the one assigned by this modified code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `newOp.retain` to a different value than the one assigned by this modified code.

DONE.
