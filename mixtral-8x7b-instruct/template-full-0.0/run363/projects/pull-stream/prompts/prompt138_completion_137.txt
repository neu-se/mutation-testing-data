 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.toString()` returns a string representation of the `cb` function, rather than invoking the function as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / cb
```
This would result in different behavior because if `cb` is not a number, it would throw a `TypeError` when dividing by `cb`. In contrast, the original code would not throw an error in this situation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(cb)
