  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function is being called with the `reverse` method, which would return a reversed version of the filtered data, rather than the filtered data itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function is being called with the `slice` method, which would return a slice of the filtered data starting from the second element, rather than the filtered data itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filter.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` function is being called with the `map` method, which would return a new array with each element multiplied by 2, rather than the filtered data itself.

DONE.
