  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name.toLowerCase(), policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the policy name to lowercase, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.clone()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method would create a new policy object with the same name, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property is being used as the key instead of the `name` property of the policy object, which could cause the `get()` method to return a different policy than expected.

DONE.
