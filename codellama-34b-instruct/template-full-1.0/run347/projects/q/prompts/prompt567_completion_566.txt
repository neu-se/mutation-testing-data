  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = 42
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `result` would be 42 instead of being calculated from `Q.promised(getFooPromise)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = Q(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` would be a promise that resolves to 42 instead of being a promise of the return value of `Q.promised(getFooPromise)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result = Q.promised(getBarPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` would be a promise of the return value of `Q.promised(getBarPromise)` instead of being a promise of the return value of `Q.promised(getFooPromise)`.

DONE.
