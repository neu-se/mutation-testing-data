  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to pass all elements of the array as arguments, while this replacement only passes the first element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to pass all elements of the array as arguments, while this replacement only passes the elements starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.concat(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to pass all elements of the array as arguments, while this replacement passes the elements of the array followed by the number 1.

DONE.
