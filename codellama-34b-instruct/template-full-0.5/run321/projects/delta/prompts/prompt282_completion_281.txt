  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the string, rather than the length of the op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherOp.retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the other op, rather than the length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, otherOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the string, and also apply the attributes of the other op.

DONE.
