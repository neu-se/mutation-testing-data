  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not a function, and would trigger a runtime error when invoked as one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject()` method throws an error when called without arguments, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function does not return a value, and would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` instead of the original value.

DONE.
