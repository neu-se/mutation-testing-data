  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of the expected object, causing the `extract` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return `null` instead of the expected object, causing the `extract` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host != baseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would return a different object than expected, causing the `extract` function to fail.

DONE.
