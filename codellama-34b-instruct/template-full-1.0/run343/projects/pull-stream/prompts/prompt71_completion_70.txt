  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `op`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value of `op` by 2, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the value of `op`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
