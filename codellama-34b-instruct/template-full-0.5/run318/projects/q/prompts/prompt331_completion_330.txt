  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` and `reject` are reversed, causing the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(value + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the resolved value is incremented by 1, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise is rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the promise to be in a rejected state instead of a resolved state.

DONE.
