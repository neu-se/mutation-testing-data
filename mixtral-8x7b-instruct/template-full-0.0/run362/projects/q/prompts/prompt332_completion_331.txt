 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, while this change resolves the promise with the original `result` variable, which might not have the desired effect in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw result;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise, while this change throws an exception with the `result` variable, which might not have the desired effect in the context of the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return result;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment resolves the promise with the result of the `promiseDispatch` method, while this change returns the result directly, which might not have the desired effect in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
