  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the starting index of the slice, potentially including or excluding important arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the first two arguments, potentially excluding important arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include the second argument, potentially excluding important arguments.

DONE.
