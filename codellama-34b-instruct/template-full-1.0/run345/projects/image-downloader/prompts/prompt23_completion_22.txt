  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"."
```
This would result in different behavior because `"."` is the parent directory of the current directory, whereas `__dirname` is the current directory itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not a valid path, and would cause the `path.resolve` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` is the name of the current file, whereas `__dirname` is the current directory.

DONE.
