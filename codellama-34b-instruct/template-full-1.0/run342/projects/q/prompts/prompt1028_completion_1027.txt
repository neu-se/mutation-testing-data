  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null()()
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would throw an error, whereas the original code would call the `nodeback` function with the arguments `(null, value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined()()
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would throw an error, whereas the original code would call the `nodeback` function with the arguments `(null, value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
node()()
```
This would result in different behavior because `node` is not a function and would throw an error, whereas the original code would call the `nodeback` function with the arguments `(null, value)`.

DONE.
