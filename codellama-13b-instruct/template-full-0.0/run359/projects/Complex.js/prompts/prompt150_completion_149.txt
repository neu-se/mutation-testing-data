  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called with no arguments, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause the `isInfinite` method to be called with no arguments, resulting in a different behavior.
