 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy code fragment uses "oo" instead of "ou" for the plural form of "goose".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy code fragment does not add the "s" or "es" suffix for the plural form of "goose".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'gooses' + num
```
This would result in different behavior because the buggy code fragment concatenates the "s" or "es" suffix with the number passed to the `plural` function, which is not the expected behavior.

DONE.
