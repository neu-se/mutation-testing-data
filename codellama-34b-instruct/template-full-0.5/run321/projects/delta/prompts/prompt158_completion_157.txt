  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return a positive number, even if the iterator is at the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the next element in the array, even if the iterator is at the end of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return true, even if the iterator is at the end of the array.

DONE.
