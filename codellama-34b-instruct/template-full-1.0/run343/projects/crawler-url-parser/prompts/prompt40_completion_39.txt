  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `parsedUrl.host` was null and if `baseUrlStr` was not null, but the new code fragment also checks if `baseUrlStr` is not null. If `baseUrlStr` is null, the new code fragment would still result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if `parsedUrl.host` was null and if `baseUrlStr` was not null, but the new code fragment checks if `parsedUrl.host` is null or if `baseUrlStr` is null. If both `parsedUrl.host` and `baseUrlStr` are null, the new code fragment would still result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
