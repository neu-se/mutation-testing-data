  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow` is not the same function as `Math.exp`. While both functions return exponential results, `Math.pow` takes two arguments and returns the first argument raised to the power of the second argument, whereas `Math.exp` takes a single argument and returns the exponential of that argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is not used to calculate the exponent. While `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are used in the implementation of the exponential function, they are used in different parts of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is not used to calculate the exponent. While `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` are used in the implementation of the exponential function, they are used in different parts of the code
