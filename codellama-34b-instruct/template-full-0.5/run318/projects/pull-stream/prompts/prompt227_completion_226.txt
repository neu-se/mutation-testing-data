  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because `!test` is the opposite of `test`, so it would return the opposite result of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `test && false` is always false, regardless of the value of `test`, so it would always return false, even if the original code fragment returned true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `test || true` is always true, regardless of the value of `test`, so it would always return true, even if the original code fragment returned false.

DONE.
