  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted twice, once with the original reason and once with the modified reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("rejectionHandled", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with the wrong reason, which could cause confusion and lead to incorrect handling of the rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit("unhandledRejection", reason, promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the event would be emitted with the wrong reason, which could cause confusion and lead to incorrect handling of the rejection.

DONE.
