  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the cursor by 1, which would cause the `diff()` function to start comparing the strings at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the cursor by 1, which would cause the `diff()` function to start comparing the strings at the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cursor * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the cursor value, which would cause the `diff()` function to start comparing the strings at the wrong index.

DONE.
