  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!domain
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` would be undefined, and the code within the `if (domain)` block would not be executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain = undefind
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` would be set to `undefined`, and the code within the `if (domain)` block would not be executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
domain = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `domain` would be set to `null`, and the code within the `if (domain)` block would not be executed.

DONE.
