 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Rejected!'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the catch block would now throw an error instead of resolving the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method expects a function as its first argument, and `null` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` inside the `catch` block would refer to the global object, not the promise being caught.

DONE.
