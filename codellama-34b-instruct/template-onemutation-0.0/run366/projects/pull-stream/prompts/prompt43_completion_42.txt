  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.slice()` returns a shallow copy of the `ref` array, whereas `ref` returns the original array. This change would cause the `pull` function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `pull` function.
