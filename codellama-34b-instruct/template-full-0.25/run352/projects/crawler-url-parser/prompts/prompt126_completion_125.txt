  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(linkurl, pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` function with the `linkurl` and `pageurl` arguments, which would return a different result than the original code fragment that only called `parse` with the `linkurl` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.parse(pageurl)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` method on the `linkurl` object with the `pageurl` argument, which would return a different result than the original code fragment that called the `parse` function with the `linkurl` and `pageurl` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.parse(linkurl)

This would result in different behavior because it would call the `parse` method on the `linkurl` object with the `linkurl` argument, which would return a different result than the original code fragment that called the
