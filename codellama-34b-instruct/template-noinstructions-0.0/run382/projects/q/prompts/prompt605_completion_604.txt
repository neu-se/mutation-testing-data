  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.bind(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value, whereas the original code uses `self` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.call(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the function immediately, whereas the original code uses `self` as a reference to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch.apply(self)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the function immediately, whereas the original code uses `self` as a reference to the function.

DONE.
