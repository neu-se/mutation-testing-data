  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `throw new Error('Invalid operation');`
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, whereas the replacement code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `someOtherArray.map`
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `map` method on the `ops` array, whereas the replacement code fragment uses the `map` method on some other array called `someOtherArray`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `null`
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns an array of `Op` objects, whereas the replacement code fragment returns `null`.

DONE.
