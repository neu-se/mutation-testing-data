  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
not(verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the boolean result of the `verb` variable, potentially changing the outcome of the query.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the boolean result of the `verb` variable, potentially changing the outcome of the query.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the boolean result of the `verb` variable, potentially changing the outcome of the query.

DONE.
