  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `query` method would return `null` instead of `false` if the combination of path and action is not governed by the policy, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method would return `true` instead of `false` if the action is explicitly denied, which could lead to incorrect authorization decisions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `query` method, which could lead to incorrect authorization decisions.

DONE.
