  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is used to resolve the promise with a value, whereas `reject` is used to reject the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would throw an exception, whereas `reject` is used to reject the promise with a reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, whereas `reject` is a function that takes a reason.

DONE.
