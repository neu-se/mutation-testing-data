  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `.catch` is not the same as `.fail` in Q. `.catch` is used to catch and handle rejections, while `.fail` is used to handle errors in a promise chain. Using `.catch` in this context would result in the deferred promise resolving instead of rejecting, even if an error occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then` is not the same as `.fail` in Q. Using `.then` in this context would result in the deferred promise resolving normally, even if an error occurs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(nodeArgs).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `nfapply` is not the same as `fapply` in Q. `nfapply`
