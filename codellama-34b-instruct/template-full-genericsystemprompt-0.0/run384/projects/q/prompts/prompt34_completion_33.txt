  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is incremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if the incremented value is used in a subsequent operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is multiplied by 2, which could cause the program to behave differently if the multiplied value is used in a subsequent operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `task` variable is decremented by 1, which could cause the program to behave differently if the decremented value is used in a subsequent operation.

DONE.
