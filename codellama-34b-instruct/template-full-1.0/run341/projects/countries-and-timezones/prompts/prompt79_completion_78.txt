  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would result in unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimeZone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function than the original code fragment, which would result in unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code fragment, which would result in unexpected behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
