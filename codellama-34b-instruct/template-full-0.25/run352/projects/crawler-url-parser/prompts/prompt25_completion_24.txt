  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#!'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact and add a new fragment identifier.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment would leave it intact and add a random string to it.

DONE.
