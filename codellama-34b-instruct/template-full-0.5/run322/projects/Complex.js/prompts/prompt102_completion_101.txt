  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(plus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus` variable is not being used in the original code, and it is being used here, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `minus` variable is not being used in the original code, and it is being used here, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(plus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plus` and `minus` variables are not being used in the original code, and they are being used here, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
