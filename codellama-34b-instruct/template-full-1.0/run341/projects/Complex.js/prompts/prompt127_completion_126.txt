  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false for the case where `a` is finite, and it would return true for the case where `a` is infinite. This would cause the second branch of the `if` statement to be taken, which would return infinity, regardless of the value of `z`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for the case where `a` is finite, and it would return false for the case where `a` is infinite. This would cause the first branch of the `if` statement to be taken, which would return the value of `a`, regardless of the value of `z`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false for the case where `z`
