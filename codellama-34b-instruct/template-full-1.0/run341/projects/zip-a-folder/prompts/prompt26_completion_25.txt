  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`format, {gzip: true, gzipOptions: {level: 1}}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzipOptions` object is not the original object passed in, and the `level` property is set to 1 instead of 9.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`format, {gzip: false, gzipOptions: {level: 9}}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `gzip` property is set to `false` instead of `true`, and the `level` property is set to 9 instead of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`format, {store: true, zlib: {level: 0}}`
```
This would result in different behavior because the `store` property is set to `true` instead of `false`, and the `zlib` object is used instead of the `gzip` object. The `level` property
