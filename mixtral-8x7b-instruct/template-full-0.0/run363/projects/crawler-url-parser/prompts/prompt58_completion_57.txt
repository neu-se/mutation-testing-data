 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the second parsing of the `currentUrl` would not happen if the protocol is not `http:` or `https:`, potentially causing incorrect parsing of some URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, result_normalize_options, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result_normalize_options` would be used for parsing the `currentUrlStr`, potentially changing the parsing result and causing some tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.parse('https://' + currentUrlStr, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because a protocol would always be added to `currentUrlStr` before parsing, potentially causing incorrect parsing of some URLs and causing some tests to fail.

DONE.
