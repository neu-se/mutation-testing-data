  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `end, null` passes `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `end, undefined` passes `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function, while the modified code fragment `end, 'foo'` passes the string `'foo'` instead.

DONE.
