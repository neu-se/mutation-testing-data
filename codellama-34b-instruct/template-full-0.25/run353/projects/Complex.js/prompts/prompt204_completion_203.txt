  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it may have a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.b
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.b` is a different property than `b`, and it may have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different expression than `b`, and it may have a different value.

DONE.
