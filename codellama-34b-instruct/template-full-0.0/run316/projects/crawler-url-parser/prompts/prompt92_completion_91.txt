  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method to remove any characters after a semicolon in the `href` string, while the new code fragment does not perform any replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"").trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not trim the `href` string, while the new code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.replace(/;.*$/g,"").toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not convert the `href` string to lowercase, while the new code fragment does.

DONE.
