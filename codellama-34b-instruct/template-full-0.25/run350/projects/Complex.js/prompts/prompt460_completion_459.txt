  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which is a small positive value used to compare floating-point numbers. However, the modified code fragment checks if the absolute value of `a` is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `a` is very small.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) <= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than `Complex['EPSILON']`, which is a small positive value used to compare floating-point numbers. However, the modified code fragment checks if the absolute value of `a` is less than or equal to `Complex['EPSILON']`, which
