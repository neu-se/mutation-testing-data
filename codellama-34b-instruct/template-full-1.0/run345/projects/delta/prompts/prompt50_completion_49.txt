  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NULL_CHARACTER
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `embedType` property of the `a` object matches the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant, which is not what the original code intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `embedType` property of the `b` object matches the `embedType` property of the `a` object, which is not what the original code intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `Object.keys()` method is defined on the `b` object, which is not what the original code intended to do.

DONE.
