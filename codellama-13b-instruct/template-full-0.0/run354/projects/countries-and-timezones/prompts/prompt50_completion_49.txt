  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with the `name` parameter, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the test suite to fail if the `getTimezone` function is not properly tested.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with an empty object as the second parameter, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the test suite to fail if the `getTimezone` function is not properly tested.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(name, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function is called with an object as the second parameter, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the test suite to fail if the
