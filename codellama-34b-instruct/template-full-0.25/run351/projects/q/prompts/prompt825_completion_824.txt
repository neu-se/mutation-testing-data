  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which modifies the resolved value by adding 1 to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which modifies the resolved value by multiplying it by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value - 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which modifies the resolved value by subtracting 1 from it.

DONE.
