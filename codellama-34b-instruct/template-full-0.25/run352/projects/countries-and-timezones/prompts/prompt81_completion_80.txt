  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter(c => c.timezones.length > 0).map(c => getCountry(c.id, options))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would remove any countries that do not have any timezones, whereas the original code would include all countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(c => getCountry(c.id, options)).filter(c => c.timezones.length > 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would be applied to the result of the `map` method, which would include all countries, whereas the original code would only include countries that have timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.map(c => getCountry(c.id, options)).filter(c => c.timezones.length > 0).map(c => c.id)
```
This would result in different
