  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` object is converted to a string using the `toString()` method, which may produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` object is converted to a primitive value using the `valueOf()` method, which may produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
message.toJSON()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` object is converted to a JSON string using the `toJSON()` method, which may produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
