 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
<any value>
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function checks if the input is an object and not null, so providing any other value would bypass this check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function checks if the input is an object and not null, so providing null would bypass this check and throw a TypeError in the next line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function checks if the input is an object and not null, so providing an array would bypass this check and throw a TypeError in the next line.

DONE.
