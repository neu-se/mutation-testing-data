  Understood, I will apply mutation testing to the code and provide three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would receive a `null` value instead of the expected `data` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would receive an `undefined` value instead of the expected `data` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ data: data }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function would receive an object with a `data` property instead of the expected `data` value.

DONE.
