  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `slice` method to extract a substring from the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)`. This can be a useful way to extract specific information from an object's string representation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).split(' ')[1]
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `split` method to split the result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(obj)` into an array of substrings, and then selects the second element of the array. This can be a useful way to extract specific information from an object's string representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).match(/^\[object (.*)\]$/)[1]
```
This code fragment is
