  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not throw an error, but this new code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a function as an argument to `task`, but this new code fragment passes `null` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task(function() { throw new Error("This is a buggy code fragment"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a function as an argument to `task`, but this new code fragment passes a function that throws an error instead.

DONE.
