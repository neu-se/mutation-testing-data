  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the entire `currentUrl` object, instead of just the `url` property, to the `Map` object's `get()` method. This would cause the code to behave differently, because the `Map` object would attempt to look up the wrong key in the map, and would not find the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the `protocol` property of the `currentUrl` object, instead of the `url` property, to the `Map` object's `get()` method. This would cause the code to behave differently, because the `Map` object would attempt to look up the wrong key in the map, and would not find the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be passing the `path` property
