  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of `reject`, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown instead of rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be logged to the console instead of being thrown or rejected.

DONE.
