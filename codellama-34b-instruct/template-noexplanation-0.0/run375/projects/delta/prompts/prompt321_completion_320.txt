  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'number'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it removes the `typeof` operator, which could cause the code to behave differently if `op.retain` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'string'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the type check from `number` to `string`. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.retain` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'object'
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it changes the type check from `number` to `object`. This could cause the code to behave differently if `op.retain` is an object.

DONE.
