  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `Q` object, but replacing it with `undefined` would cause the function to fail, as it is relying on the `Q` object to provide the `nodeify` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `Q` object, but replacing it with `null` would cause the function to fail, as it is relying on the `Q` object to provide the `nodeify` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `Q` object, but replacing it with a string would cause the function to fail, as it is relying on the `Q` object to provide the `nodeify` function.

DONE.
