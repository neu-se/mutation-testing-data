  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the array of arguments from 1, which would result in `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the array of arguments, which would change the program's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the array of arguments by 0, which would result in an empty array.

DONE.
