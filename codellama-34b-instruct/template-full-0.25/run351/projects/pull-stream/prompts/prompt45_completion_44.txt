  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `read.source` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if it's a string. This change could cause the function to behave differently when the `read` argument is an object with a `source` property that is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `read.source` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if it's an object. This change could cause the function to behave differently when the `read` argument is an object with a `source` property that is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read && typeof read.source === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `read.source` is a function, while this
