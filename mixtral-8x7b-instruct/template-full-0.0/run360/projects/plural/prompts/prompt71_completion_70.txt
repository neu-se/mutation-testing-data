 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule added 'cellos' as a special case for a single word, while this change would make it the general rule for all words ending in 'o'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match any word ending in 'o', not just the specific word 'cello'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 's' to the end of every word, regardless of the original rules.

DONE.
