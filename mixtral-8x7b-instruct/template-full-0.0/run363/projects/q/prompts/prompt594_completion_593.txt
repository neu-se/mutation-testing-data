 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` and `self` may not refer to the same object in certain contexts, such as when using arrow functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
globalThis
