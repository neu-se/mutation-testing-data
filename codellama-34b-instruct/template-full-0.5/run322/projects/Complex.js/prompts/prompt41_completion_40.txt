  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` returns the base-2 logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` returns the base-10 logarithm of a number, whereas `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log(a * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log(a * b)` would return the natural logarithm of the product of `a` and `b`, whereas `Math.log(a + b)` would return the natural logarithm of the sum of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
