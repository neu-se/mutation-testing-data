  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject(new Error("Invalid nodeback")));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not defined on the `deferred` object, and would throw a `TypeError` when called. Additionally, the `new Error("Invalid nodeback")` argument is not a valid nodeback function, and would cause the `nodeArgs.push()` method to throw a `TypeError` as well.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
        deferred.reject(err);
    } else {
        deferred.resolve(result
