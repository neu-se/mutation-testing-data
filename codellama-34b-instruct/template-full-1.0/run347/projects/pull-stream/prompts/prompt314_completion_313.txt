  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `data` to be a non-null value, but `null` is a falsy value in JavaScript, so it would trigger the `else` branch of the `if` statement instead of the main branch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value in JavaScript, so it would trigger the `else` branch of the `if` statement instead of the main branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value in JavaScript, so it would trigger the `else` branch of the `if` statement instead of the main branch.

DONE.
