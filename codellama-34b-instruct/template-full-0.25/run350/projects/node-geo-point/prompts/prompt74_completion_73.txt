  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(θ) + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function converts radians to degrees, but adding 360 to the result would cause the bearing to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `θ` variable represents the bearing in radians, and subtracting 180 from it would cause the bearing to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
θ + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and adding it to `θ` would cause the bearing to be outside the range of 0 to 360 degrees.

DONE.
