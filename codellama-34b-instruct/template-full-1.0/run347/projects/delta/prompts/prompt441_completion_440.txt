  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` is a different method than `substr` and could cause different output in the final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` is a different method than `substr` and could cause different output in the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.length.substr
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` returns the length of the `insert` string, while `substr` returns a substring of the `insert` string. Using `length.substr` would cause an error because `substr` is not a method of a number.

DONE.
