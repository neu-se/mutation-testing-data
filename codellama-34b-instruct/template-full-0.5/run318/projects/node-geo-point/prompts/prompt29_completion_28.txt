  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are being swapped, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.coordinates[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinates` property is being accessed instead of the `latitude` property, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.coordinates[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `coordinates` property is being accessed instead of the `longitude` property, which would cause the calculation of the distance and bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
