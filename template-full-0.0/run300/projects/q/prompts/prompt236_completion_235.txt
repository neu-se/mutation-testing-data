  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `promise` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `deferred` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.apply(Q)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to be called on the `Q` object instead of the `resolvedPromise` object, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
