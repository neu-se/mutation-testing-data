  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 1; i <= tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop body would not be executed for the first value of `tokens[0]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i < tokens.length - 1; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop body would not be executed for the last value of `tokens[tokens.length - 1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0; i != tokens.length; i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop body would not be executed for any value of `tokens` that is not a number.

DONE.
