  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing + 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now calculated as 180 degrees different from the original bearing, which would lead to a different destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance * 2, bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance is now doubled, which would lead to a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.calculateDestination(this, distance, bearing * -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing is now negative, which would lead to a different destination point.

DONE.
