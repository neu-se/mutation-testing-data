  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object has a new property `foo` that is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.bar
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object has a new property `bar` that is not present in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.baz
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` object has a new property `baz` that is not present in the original code.

DONE.
