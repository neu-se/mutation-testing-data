  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would have different parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, onAbort, abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the parameters is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the parameters is different.

DONE.
