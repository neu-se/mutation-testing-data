  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object and does not have a `then` method, which is called on the line `deferred.resolve(_fulfilled(value))`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is an object and has a `then` method, which would cause the code to enter the `fulfilled` branch instead of the `rejected` branch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a number and does not have a `then` method, which would cause the code to enter the `rejected` branch instead of the `fulfilled` branch.

DONE.
