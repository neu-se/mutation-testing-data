  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the tile size, while this code fragment uses the `**` operator to calculate the tile size. The `**` operator has a higher precedence than the `+` operator, so it would be evaluated first, potentially resulting in a different value for the tile size.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()` function to calculate the tile size, while this code fragment uses the `*` operator to calculate the tile size. The `*` operator has a lower precedence than the `+` operator, so it would be evaluated after the `+` operator, potentially resulting in a different value for the tile size.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 / zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow()`
