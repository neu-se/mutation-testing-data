 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable would be assigned the value `null` instead of an instance of `Promise.prototype`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(descriptor)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fallback` and `inspect` arguments would not be passed to the `Promise` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` variable would be assigned a `Date` object instead of an instance of `Promise.prototype`.

By introducing these changes, the test suite may not catch the errors because the code would break at an earlier stage, and the expected behavior of the `Promise` object would not be realized. DONE.
