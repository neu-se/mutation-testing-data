  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would fulfill the promise with the value, while the modified code fragment would reject the promise with the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would fulfill the promise with the value, while the modified code fragment would fulfill the promise with undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfill(value + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would fulfill the promise with the value, while the modified code fragment would fulfill the promise with the value plus one.

DONE.
