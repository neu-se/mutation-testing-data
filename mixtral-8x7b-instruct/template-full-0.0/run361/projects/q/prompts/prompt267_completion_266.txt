 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(reject(reason));
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately wraps the rejected promise in a resolved promise, preventing the rejection from being handled properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `reject` method on the `deferred` object directly, instead of through the `become` function, potentially bypassing important logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new rejected promise using the `Promise` constructor, instead of using the `deferred` object's `reject` method, potentially bypassing important logic.

DONE.
