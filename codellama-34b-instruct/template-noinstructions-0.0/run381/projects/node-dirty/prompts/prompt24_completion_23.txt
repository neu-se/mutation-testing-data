  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called immediately, regardless of whether the data is persisted or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called only if the data is not persisted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called only if it is defined and the data is persisted.

DONE.
