  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("test"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return 42; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value 42, whereas the original code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Promise.reject(new Error("test")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would not.

DONE.
