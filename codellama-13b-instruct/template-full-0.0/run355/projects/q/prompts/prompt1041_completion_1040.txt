  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.resolve` function is called twice, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.resolve` function is called with a different argument, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve({
    head: value,
    tail: next.promise
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ends.resolve` function is called with a different argument, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code.

DONE.
