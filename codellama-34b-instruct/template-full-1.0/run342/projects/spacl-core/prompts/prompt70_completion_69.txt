  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.replace(/\//g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/\//g` replaces all forward slashes in the `path` string with an empty string. In the original code fragment, the `path` variable is not modified, so the `query` method will be called with the original path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split("/").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method with a separator of `/` splits the `path` string into an array of substrings at each occurrence of `/`. The `pop` method then removes the last element of the array, which may be different from the original path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method with an index of 1 returns the substring of the `path` string starting from the second character. In the original code fragment,
