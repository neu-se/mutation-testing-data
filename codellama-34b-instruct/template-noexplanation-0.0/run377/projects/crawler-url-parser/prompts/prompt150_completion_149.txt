  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the string at every backslash character, rather than every forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the string at every forward slash character, which is the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This will cause the `split` method to split the string at every forward slash or backslash character.

DONE.
