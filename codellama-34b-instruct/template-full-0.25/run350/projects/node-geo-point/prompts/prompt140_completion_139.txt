  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return the same value for the longitude, regardless of the input value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a value that is one degree of longitude greater than the input value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `adjustPrecision` method to always return a value that is twice the value of the input longitude.

DONE.
