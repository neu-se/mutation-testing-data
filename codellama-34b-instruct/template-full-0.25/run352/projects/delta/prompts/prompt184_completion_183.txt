  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return `'string'` if `thisOp.retain` is a string, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it, even if `thisOp.retain` is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return `'object'` if `thisOp.retain` is an object, which would cause the code to enter the `if` block and execute the code inside it, even if `thisOp.retain` is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` would return `'undefined'` if `thisOp.retain` is undefined, which would cause the code to
