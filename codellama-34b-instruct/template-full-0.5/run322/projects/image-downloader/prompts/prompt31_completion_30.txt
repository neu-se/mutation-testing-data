  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimLeft` method with a parameter of 1 would remove the first character of the URL, which could cause the URL to be invalid and the request to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimRight(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trimRight` method with a parameter of 1 would remove the last character of the URL, which could cause the URL to be invalid and the request to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method with a parameter of 1 would remove the first character of the URL, which could cause the URL to be invalid and the request to fail.

DONE.
