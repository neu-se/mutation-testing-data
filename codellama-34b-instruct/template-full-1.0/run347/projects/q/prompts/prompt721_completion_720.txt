  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(JSON.stringify(deferred));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a JSON string representation of the deferred object, whereas the original code would reject the promise with an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would empty the promises array, whereas the original code would leave it unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the promises array, whereas the original code would resolve it with an array of values or promises.

DONE.
