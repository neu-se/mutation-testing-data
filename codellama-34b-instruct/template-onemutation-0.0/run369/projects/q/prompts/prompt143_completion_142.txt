  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack && (!error.__minimumStackCounter__ || error.__minimumStackCounter__ < p.stackCounter)
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed from `>` to `<`, which would cause the condition to be true when the `error.__minimumStackCounter__` is less than `p.stackCounter`, instead of when it is greater. This would cause the `stacks.unshift(p.stack)` line to be executed even if the `error.__minimumStackCounter__` is not greater than `p.stackCounter`, which would result in a different stack trace being generated.
