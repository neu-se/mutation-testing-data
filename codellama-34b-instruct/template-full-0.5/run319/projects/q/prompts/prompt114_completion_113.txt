  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on `null`, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown, whereas the original code would call `call` on `thisp`, which could be any value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on `undefined`, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown, whereas the original code would call `call` on `thisp`, which could be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would be called on `0`, which would result in a `TypeError` being thrown, whereas the original code would call `call` on `thisp`, which could be any value.

DONE.
