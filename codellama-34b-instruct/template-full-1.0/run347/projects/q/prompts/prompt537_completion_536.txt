  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value passed to `spread` is the resolved value of a promise, while in the modified code, the value passed to `spread` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value passed to `spread` is the resolved value of a promise, while in the modified code, the value passed to `spread` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value passed to `spread` is the resolved value of a promise, while in the modified code, the value passed to `spread` is an empty array.

DONE.
