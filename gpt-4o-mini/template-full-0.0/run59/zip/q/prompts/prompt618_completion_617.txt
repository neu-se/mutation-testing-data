Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the arguments passed to the `dispatch` method, potentially causing it to look for a property that does not exist or to behave incorrectly when trying to access the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key + '1']
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the key being accessed by appending '1', which would lead to accessing a different property than intended, likely resulting in `undefined` if that property does not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to perform a multiplication operation on the key, which is not a valid operation for string keys, leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to access the property.

DONE.
