  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "object" && window && window.document && window.document.title
```
This would result in different behavior because `window` and `document` are browser-specific objects that are not present in the Node.js environment, where this code is typically run.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.longStackSupport && false
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.longStackSupport` is a boolean flag that controls the inclusion of long stack traces, and setting it to `false` would disable the feature.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof Q !== "undefined" && Q.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nextTick` is a function that schedules a task to run in the next iteration of the event loop, and checking its existence would ensure that the code only runs in an environment where Q is defined.

DONE.
