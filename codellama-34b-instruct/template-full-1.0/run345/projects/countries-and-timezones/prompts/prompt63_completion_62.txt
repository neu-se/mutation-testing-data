  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.id
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `id` property of the `data` object as an argument to the `buildCountry` function, rather than passing the `data` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the value of the `id` property of the `data` object as an argument to the `buildCountry` function, rather than passing the `data` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a `null` value as an argument to the `buildCountry` function, rather than passing the `data` object.

DONE.
