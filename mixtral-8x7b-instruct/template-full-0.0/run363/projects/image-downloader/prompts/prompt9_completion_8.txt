 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `options.dest` to a string, which may not have the desired effect if `options.dest` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.basename
