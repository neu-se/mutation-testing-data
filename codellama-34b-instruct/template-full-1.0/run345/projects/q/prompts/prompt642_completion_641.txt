  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args.toString()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is a JavaScript method that returns a string representing the object, but it won't return the original array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args + '']
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator `+` is used on an array and a string, resulting in the array being converted to a string and then concatenated with the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, args * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` is used on an array and a number, resulting in the array being converted to a number and then multiplied by 2.

DONE.
