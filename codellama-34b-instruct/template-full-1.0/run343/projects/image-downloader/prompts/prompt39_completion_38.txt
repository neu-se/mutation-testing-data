  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `once` method to listen for the 'close' event on the stream, while this replaced code uses `resolve` to immediately resolve the promise without waiting for the stream to finish.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 reject();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reject` method to reject the promise when the request fails, while this replaced code uses `resolve` to immediately resolve the promise without waiting for the stream to finish.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 resolve({ filename: dest, data: dest });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves the promise with a single object that contains the filename and stream data, while this replaced code resolves the promise with an object that contains the filename and the destination stream.

DONE.
