  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` diff
-  typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null
+  typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' || thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `thisOp.retain` is an object, while the modified condition checks if it is not null. This could cause the program to behave differently when `thisOp.retain` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` diff
+  typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original condition checks if `thisOp.retain` is not an object, while the modified condition checks if it is an object. This could cause the program to behave differently when `thisOp.retain` is not an object.
