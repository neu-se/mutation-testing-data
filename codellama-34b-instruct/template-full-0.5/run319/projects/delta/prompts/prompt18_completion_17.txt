  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different object than `a`, and the `concat` method will return a new array that contains the elements of both `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is a string concatenation operation, and the `concat` method will return a new array that contains the elements of both `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.concat(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.concat(b)` is a method call that returns a new array that contains the elements of both `a` and `b`.

DONE.
