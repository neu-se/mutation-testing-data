  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path is a substring of the page URL path, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!pageurl_path.includes(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the page URL path does not contain the link URL path, which is the opposite of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.startsWith(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the link URL path starts with the page URL path, which is a different condition than the original code.

DONE.
