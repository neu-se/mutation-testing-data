  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the second element of the `rules` array instead of the first element, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the third element of the `rules` array instead of the first element, which is the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the first element of the `rules` array instead of the first element of the `rule` array, which is the intended behavior.

DONE.
