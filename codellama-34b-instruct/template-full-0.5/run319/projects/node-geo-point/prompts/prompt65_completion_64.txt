  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` variable is used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere, and adding 180 to it would cause the distance calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` variable is used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the distance calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Δλ` variable is used to calculate the distance between two points on a sphere, and subtracting 180 from it would cause the distance calculation to be off by a factor of 2.

DONE.
