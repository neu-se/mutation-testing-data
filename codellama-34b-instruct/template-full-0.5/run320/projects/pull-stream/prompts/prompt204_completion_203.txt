  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is not the same as the `cb` function, and it would cause the `next` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not the same as the `cb` function, and it would cause the `next` function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is not the same as the `cb` function, and it would cause the `next` function to return a different value.

DONE.
