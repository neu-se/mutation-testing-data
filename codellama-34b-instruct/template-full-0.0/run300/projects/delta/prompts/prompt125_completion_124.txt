  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than or equal to firstLeft, but this code checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than firstLeft.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than or equal to firstLeft, but this code checks if the peeked op is an insert and its length is less than firstLeft.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft)
