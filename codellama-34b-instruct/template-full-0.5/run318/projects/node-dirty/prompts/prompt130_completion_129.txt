  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let [key, cbs] = this._queue.values();
```
This would result in different behavior because `values()` returns an iterator of the values in the queue, rather than the key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let [key, cbs] = this._data.entries();
```
This would result in different behavior because `entries()` returns an iterator of the key-value pairs in the data object, rather than the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let [key, cbs] = this._queue.keys();
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys()` returns an iterator of the keys in the queue, rather than the key-value pairs.

DONE.
