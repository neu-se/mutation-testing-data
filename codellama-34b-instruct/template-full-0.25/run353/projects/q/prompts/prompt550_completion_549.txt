  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` is a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(new Error("error"))` is a rejected promise with a specific error message, whereas `Q` is a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve(undefined)` is a resolved promise with the value `undefined`, whereas `Q` is a promise that is resolved with the value `undefined`.

DONE.
