  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delay` method would introduce a delay before the `dispatch` method is called, which could cause the test to fail even if the `dispatch` method is working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would change the context of the `dispatch` method to `object`, which could cause the test to fail if the `dispatch` method relies on the context of the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.proxy(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `proxy` method would create a new function that wraps the `dispatch` method, which could cause the test to fail if the `dispatch` method is not working correctly or if the test is relying on the specific implementation of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
