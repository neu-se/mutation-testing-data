 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event handler in the `MessageChannel` code would not be set, and the `flush` function would not be called asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'placeholder'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event handler in the `MessageChannel` code would be set to a string instead of a function, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onmessage` event handler in the `MessageChannel` code would be set to an empty function, which would prevent the `flush` function from being called asynchronously.

DONE.
