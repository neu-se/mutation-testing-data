  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null || baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of `&&`, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `true` if `baseUrlStr` is not `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host == null && baseUrlStr != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of `||`, which would cause the condition to always evaluate to `false` if `baseUrlStr` is `null`.

DONE.
