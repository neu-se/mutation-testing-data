  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This change will cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, rather than the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value + 1]
```
This change will cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, but with an added offset of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value * 2]
```
This change will cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, but with a multiplier of 2.

DONE.
