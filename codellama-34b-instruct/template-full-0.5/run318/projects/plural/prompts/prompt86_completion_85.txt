  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(<any argument>, <any argument>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with different arguments, which could cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(<any argument>, <any argument>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with different arguments, which could cause the function to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(<any argument>, <any argument>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with different arguments, which could cause the function to produce a different output.

DONE.
