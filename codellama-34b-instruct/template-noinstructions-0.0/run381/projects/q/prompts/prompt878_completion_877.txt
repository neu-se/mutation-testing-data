  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the callback function is expected to be the last element in the `nodeArgs` array, so using `unshift` would cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the callback function is expected to be the last element in the `nodeArgs` array, so using `pop` would cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end.
