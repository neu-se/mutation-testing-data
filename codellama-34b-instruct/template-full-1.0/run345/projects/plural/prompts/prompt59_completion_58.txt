  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because "criteria" is not the plural form of "criterion".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is the original code fragment, and the mutation testing is to identify different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because it is the incorrect plural form of "criterion", but it is still a valid string.

DONE.
