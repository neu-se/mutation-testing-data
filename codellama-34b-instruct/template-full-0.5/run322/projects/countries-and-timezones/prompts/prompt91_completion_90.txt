  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country object with its `timezones` property set to `null` instead of an array of timezone objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country object with its `timezones` property set to an empty array instead of an array of timezone objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountry(countryId, { deprecated: !deprecated })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would return a country object with its `timezones` property set to an array of timezone objects, but the `deprecated` property of each timezone object would be inverted.

DONE.
