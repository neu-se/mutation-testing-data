  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise as is, while this modified code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise as is, while this modified code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value.toUpperCase();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the promise as is, while this modified code fragment returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise converted to uppercase.
