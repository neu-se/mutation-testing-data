  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this != Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` could refer to a different object, and `Complex` is a constructor function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex.prototype.isPrototypeOf(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is an instance of `Complex` using a different method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(this.constructor === Complex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor of `this` is the same as `Complex`, which may not always be the case.

DONE.
