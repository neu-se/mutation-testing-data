  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called on the promise returned by `nfapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the original function call was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called on the promise returned by `nfapply`, which would cause the promise to be resolved or rejected based on the result of the original function call, rather than always rejecting the promise as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then
