  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array_slice` function to create a new array from the given arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the same function to create a new array from the given arguments, but with a different set of arguments. This could result in different behavior if the arguments passed to the function are not the same as the arguments passed to the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array_slice` function to create a new array from the given arguments, while the buggy code fragment uses the `array_concat` function to create a new array from the given arguments, but with a different set of arguments. This could result in different behavior if the arguments passed to the function are not the same as the arguments passed to the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_push
```
