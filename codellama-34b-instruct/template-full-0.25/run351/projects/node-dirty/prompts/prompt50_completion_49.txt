  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at the given key, while the modified code fragment returns the value stored at the given key plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at the given key, while the modified code fragment returns the value stored at the given key multiplied by two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value stored at the given key, while the modified code fragment returns the value stored at the given key minus one.

DONE.
