  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the first attribute of the last operation, whereas the original code fragment checks all attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes[lastOp.attributes.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the last attribute of the last operation, whereas the original code fragment checks all attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.attributes.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check the attributes of the last operation starting from the second attribute, whereas the original code fragment checks all attributes.

DONE.
