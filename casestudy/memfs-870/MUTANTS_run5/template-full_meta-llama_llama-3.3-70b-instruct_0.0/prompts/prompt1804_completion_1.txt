Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/dev/null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file descriptor returned by `openSync` would be for a special file (`/dev/null`) instead of the original file, potentially causing issues with the subsequent `fchmodBase` call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
filename + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file descriptor returned by `openSync` would be for a different file (a temporary file with a `.tmp` extension) instead of the original file, potentially causing issues with the subsequent `fchmodBase` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/proc/self/fd'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file descriptor returned by `openSync` would be for a special file (`/proc/self/fd`) that contains information about the process's file descriptors, instead of the original file, potentially causing issues with the subsequent `fchmodBase` call.

DONE.
