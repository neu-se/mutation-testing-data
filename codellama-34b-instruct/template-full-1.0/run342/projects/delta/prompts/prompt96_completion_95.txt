  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because passing 0 as the first parameter to the `splice` method would remove the first element of the array, rather than inserting the new element at the specified index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting the new element at the index `this.ops.length - 1` would append the new element to the end of the array, rather than inserting it at the specified index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this.ops.length + 1) / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because inserting the new element at the index `(this.ops.length + 1) / 2` would result in the new element being inserted in the middle of the array, rather than at the specified index.

DONE.
