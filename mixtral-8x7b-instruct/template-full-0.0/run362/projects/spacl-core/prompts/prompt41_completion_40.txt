 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the path prefix from root (`/`) to current directory (`.`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'/|'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an incorrect alternative for the path prefix, allowing a pipe symbol (`|`) after the slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'/\\'
