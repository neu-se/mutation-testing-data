 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applay"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string being passed to `dispatch` method would be an incorrect one, possibly causing the method to not be found and an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1234
```
This would result in different behavior because an integer is being passed instead of a string, which would cause a type error in the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the current object, which might not have the `apply` method, causing a `TypeError` to be thrown.

DONE.
