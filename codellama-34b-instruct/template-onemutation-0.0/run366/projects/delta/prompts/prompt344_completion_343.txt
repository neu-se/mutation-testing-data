  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `embedType` is a string and `toLowerCase()` would return a new string with all characters in lowercase, which could cause the code to behave differently if the string is used as a key in an object or as a parameter in a function.
