 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` creates a new promise, while `Q.resolve(null)` immediately resolves to a value `null`. This change may bypass asynchronous behavior or error handling in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is an instance of the Q promise library, while `Promise.resolve` is a native JavaScript method. This change may cause compatibility issues or unexpected behavior in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('Error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` creates a new promise, while `Q.reject('Error')` immediately rejects the promise with an error message. This change may bypass asynchronous behavior or error handling in the test suite.
