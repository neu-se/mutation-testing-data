  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest + '1' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the filename would be different, causing the stream to write to a different file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, flags: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the flags would be different, causing the stream to overwrite the file instead of appending to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 0o666 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the mode would be different, causing the stream to have different permissions.

DONE.
