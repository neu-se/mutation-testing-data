Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the length used for the transformation, potentially causing more characters to be retained than intended, leading to incorrect text manipulation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the length used for the transformation, which could lead to data loss by retaining fewer characters than necessary, resulting in an incomplete transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length used for the transformation, which could cause the algorithm to attempt to retain more characters than available, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect data retention.

DONE.
