  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cosh`, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the new code fragment is `-cosh`, which returns the negative hyperbolic cosine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cosh`, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the new code fragment is `Math.cosh`, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number using the `Math` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `cosh`, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a number, while the new code fragment is `Math.acosh`, which returns the hyperbolic arccosine of a number using the `Math` object.
