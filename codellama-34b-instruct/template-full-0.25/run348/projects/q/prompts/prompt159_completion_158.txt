  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stackTrace"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different, and the code that uses the property would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stackTrace" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different, and the code that uses the property would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stackTrace" + "bar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the property name is different, and the code that uses the property would not work as intended.

DONE.
