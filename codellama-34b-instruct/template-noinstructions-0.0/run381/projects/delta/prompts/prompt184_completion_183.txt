  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be treated as an object, rather than a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be treated as a string, rather than a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'boolean'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` property to be treated as a boolean, rather than a number, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `compose` method.

DONE.
