  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is empty, while the new fragment will add a '#' character to the end of the URL, potentially changing its meaning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is empty, while the new fragment will add a random number to the end of the URL, potentially changing its meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'#' + Date.now()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is empty, while the new fragment will add a timestamp to the end of the URL, potentially changing its meaning.

DONE.
