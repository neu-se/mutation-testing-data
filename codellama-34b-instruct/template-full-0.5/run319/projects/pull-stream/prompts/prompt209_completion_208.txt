  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted || true
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted || true` always returns `true`, while `aborted` returns `true` only if `aborted` is truthy. This change would cause the `cb(aborted)` line to be called even if `aborted` is falsy, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `!aborted` returns `true` if `aborted` is falsy, while `aborted` returns `true` only if `aborted` is truthy. This change would cause the `cb(aborted)` line to be called only if `aborted` is falsy, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted && true` returns `true` only if `ab
