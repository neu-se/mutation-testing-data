Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include keys with `null` values in the resulting `copy`, whereas the original code excludes them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow keys with a value of `false` to be copied, ignoring all other values, including `null` and `undefined`, which the original code would include.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would copy attributes that are falsy (like `0`, `false`, or `""`), while the original code only excludes `null` and `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results in the final `copy`.

DONE.
