  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(null)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it explicitly passes `null` as the `nodeback` argument to `nodeify`, which will cause the function to return a promise instead of calling the `nodeback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(undefined)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it explicitly passes `undefined` as the `nodeback` argument to `nodeify`, which will cause the function to return a promise instead of calling the `nodeback` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).nodeify(function() {})
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it explicitly passes an empty function as the `nodeback` argument to `nodeify`, which will cause the function to return a promise instead of calling the `nodeback` function.

DONE.
