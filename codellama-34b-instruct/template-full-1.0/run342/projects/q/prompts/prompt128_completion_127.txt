  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[object]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.hasOwnProperty` would reference the global `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` function instead of the `hasOwnProperty` function defined in the local scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[object.prototype]
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` would reference the `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` function instead of the `hasOwnProperty` function defined in the local scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[hasOwnProperty]
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` would reference a different function than the one defined in the local scope.

DONE.
