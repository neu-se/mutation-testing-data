Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form 'memes' is incorrect for the word 'memo', which should be 'memos'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'memoes' is a non-standard pluralization of 'memo', while the correct plural form is 'memos'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo', 'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly suggests that the plural of 'memo' is the same as the singular form, which is not accurate.

DONE.
