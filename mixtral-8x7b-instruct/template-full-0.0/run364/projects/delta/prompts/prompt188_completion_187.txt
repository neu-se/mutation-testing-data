 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assume the embed type is 'insert', which may not be the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * 2 | 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly choose between 0 and 1, which would likely result in an incorrect embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'delete'
