  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to skip over the last operation in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to include an extra operation in the diff result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the peeked operation, which could cause the code to include twice as many operations in the diff result.

DONE.
