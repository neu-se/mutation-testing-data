 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments passed to the reducer function is changed, which could lead to unexpected results if the reducer function is not commutative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the same accumulator value is passed twice to the reducer function, which could lead to unexpected results if the reducer function is not idempotent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(data, sink)
```
This would result in different behavior because the reducer function is being passed the wrong arguments, it should receive the accumulator value and the current data, instead it is receiving the accumulator value and the sink function, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
