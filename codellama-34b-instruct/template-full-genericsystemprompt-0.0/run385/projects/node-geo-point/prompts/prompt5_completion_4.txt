  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` and `coordinates` properties are not defined on the `point` object, rather than checking if they are defined and have the correct values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || !Array.isArray(point.coordinates) || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'` or if the `coordinates` property is not an array or does not have a length of 2, rather than checking if the `type` property is equal to `'Point'` and the `coordinates` property is an array with a length of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point
