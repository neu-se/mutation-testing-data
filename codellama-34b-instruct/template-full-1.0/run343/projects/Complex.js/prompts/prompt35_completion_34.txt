  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable being checked is now the value of `_b`, which may be different from the original `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for inequality, rather than equality.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the check is now for the absolute value of `b` being less than or equal to zero, rather than `b` being equal to zero.

DONE.
