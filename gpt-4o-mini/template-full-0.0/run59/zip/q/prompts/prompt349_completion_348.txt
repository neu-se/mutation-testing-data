Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of `exception` would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined` instead of the actual error, potentially masking the original error and leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Error occurred"
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `exception` with a string literal would cause the promise to resolve with a generic error message instead of the actual error object, which would lose important context about the error that occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("Custom error")
```
This would result in different behavior because using a new error object with a custom message would always reject with the same error message regardless of the actual error that occurred, making it difficult to diagnose the specific issue that caused the rejection.

DONE.
