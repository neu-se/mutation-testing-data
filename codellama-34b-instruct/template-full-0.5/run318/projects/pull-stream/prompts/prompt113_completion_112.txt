  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `err` argument to the `cb` function, while this new fragment passes both `null` and `acc` as arguments. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, potentially causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes the `acc` argument to the `cb` function, while this new fragment passes both `err` and `null` as arguments. This could cause the `cb` function to behave differently, potentially causing the test to fail.
