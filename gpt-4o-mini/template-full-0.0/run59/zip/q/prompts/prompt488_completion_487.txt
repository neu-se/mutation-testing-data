Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the length of the `unhandledReasons` array to 1, which means that even if there were multiple unhandled reasons, only the first one would be retained, potentially losing important information about other unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it disables the tracking of unhandled rejections immediately, meaning that any subsequent unhandled rejections would not be tracked or reported, leading to a loss of visibility into promise rejection issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, unhandledRejections.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it clears the `unhandledRejections` array, effectively removing all tracked unhandled rejections without resetting the reasons, which could lead to inconsistencies in the state of unhandled rejections and their corresponding reasons.

DONE.
