  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only if there are still pending promises, rather than when all promises have been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when all promises have been resolved, rather than when there are no more pending promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed only when the `promises` array is empty, rather than when all promises have been resolved.

DONE.
