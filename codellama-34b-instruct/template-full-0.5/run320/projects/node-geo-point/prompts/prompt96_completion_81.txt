  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + (y / x) * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2(y, x)` to calculate the bearing, which takes into account the quadrant of the angle. The new code fragment only uses `cosθ` to calculate the bearing, which would result in a different bearing value in some cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + (y / x) * sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan2(y, x)` to calculate the bearing, which takes into account the quadrant of the angle. The new code fragment only uses `sinθ` to calculate the bearing, which would result in a different bearing value in some cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + (y / x) * tanθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `atan
