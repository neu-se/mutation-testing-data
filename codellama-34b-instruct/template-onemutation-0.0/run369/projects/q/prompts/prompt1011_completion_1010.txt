  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a new deferred object, while the modified code fragment creates a new deferred object with a null value. This would cause the promise chain to resolve with a null value, rather than the expected value.

DONE.
