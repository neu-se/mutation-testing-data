  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled instead of rejected, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered pending instead of fulfilled, which could cause the program to wait indefinitely for the promise to be resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" && inspected.value === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be considered fulfilled only if its value is undefined, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly if the promise is fulfilled with a non-undefined value.

DONE.
