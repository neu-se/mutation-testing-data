  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`z['re']`
This would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`z['im']`
This would result in a different function calculation, potentially leading to an incorrect return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
`z['abs']()`
This would result in a different function calculation, potentially leading to an incorrect return value.

DONE.
