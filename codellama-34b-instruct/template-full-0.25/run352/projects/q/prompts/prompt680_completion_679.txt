  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would start at the second argument instead of the first, which could cause the function to receive the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would only return the second argument instead of all the arguments, which could cause the function to receive the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1, -1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would return all the arguments except the last one, which could cause the function to receive the wrong arguments.

DONE.
