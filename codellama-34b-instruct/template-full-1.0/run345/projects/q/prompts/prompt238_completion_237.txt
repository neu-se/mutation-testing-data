  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be returned instead of the `value` argument provided to the `resolvedPromise` promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be returned instead of the `value` argument provided to the `resolvedPromise` promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty object would be returned instead of the `value` argument provided to the `resolvedPromise` promise.

DONE.
