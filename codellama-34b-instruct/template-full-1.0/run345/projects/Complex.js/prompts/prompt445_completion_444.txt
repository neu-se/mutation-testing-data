  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.5, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a result that is half the size of the original result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
100, places || 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a result that is 100 times the size of the original result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return a result that is the same size as the original result, and the imaginary part would always be 0.

DONE.
