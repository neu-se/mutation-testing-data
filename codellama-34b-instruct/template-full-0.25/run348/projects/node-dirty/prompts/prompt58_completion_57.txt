  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method is called immediately, rather than being called when the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Drain event not emitted'))
```
This would result in different behavior because an error is emitted immediately, rather than being emitted when the `drain` event is emitted.

DONE.
