  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the second condition is checking if `module` is undefined, which would be the case if the code is running in a browser environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "undefined" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the first condition is checking if `exports` is undefined, which would be the case if the code is running in a browser environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the second condition is checking if `module` is a function, which would not be the case in a browser environment.

DONE.
