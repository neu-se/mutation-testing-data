  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `updater` is called with a different argument, `key`, instead of `this.get(key)`, which is the original argument in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(key), key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `updater` is called with an additional argument, `key`, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
updater(this.get(val))
```
This would result in different behavior because `updater` is called with a different argument, `this.get(val)`, instead of `this.get(key)`, which is the original argument in the original code fragment.

DONE.
