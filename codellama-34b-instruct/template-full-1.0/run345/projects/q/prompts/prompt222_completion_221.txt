  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `constructor` property of the object created by `defer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `prototype` property of the `Object` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.__proto__
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the `prototype` property of the object created by `defer` to be the `Object` prototype.

DONE.
