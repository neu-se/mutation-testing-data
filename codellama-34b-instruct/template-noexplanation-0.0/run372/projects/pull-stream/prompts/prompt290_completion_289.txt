  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite if it does not catch this change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This change will also cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite if it does not catch this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which may reveal a weakness in the test suite if it does not catch this change.

DONE.
