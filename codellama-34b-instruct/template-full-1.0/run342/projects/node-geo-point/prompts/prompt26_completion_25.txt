  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
180 - deg2rad(point1.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the math operations are performed in a different order, which can lead to errors in the calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(deg2rad(point1.latitude))
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by `deg2rad` will be different when used with `sin`, which can affect the results of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asin(cos(deg2rad(point1.latitude)))
```
This would result in different behavior because the value returned by `cos` will be different when used with `asin`, which can affect the results of the calculation.

DONE.
