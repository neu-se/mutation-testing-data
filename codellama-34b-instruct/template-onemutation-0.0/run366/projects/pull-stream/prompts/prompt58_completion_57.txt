  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `done` is falsy, while the new code fragment checks if `done` is strictly equal to `null`. If `done` is any other falsy value (such as `undefined` or `false`), the original code fragment would still consider it as a valid callback function, while the new code fragment would not.
