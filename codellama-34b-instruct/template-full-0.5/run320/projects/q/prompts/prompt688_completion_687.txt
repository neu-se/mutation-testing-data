  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `this.dispatch` would cause the promise to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("reject", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch("reject", [])` would cause the promise to be rejected with an empty array, whereas `this.dispatch` would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("resolve", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch("resolve", [])` would cause the promise to be resolved with an empty array, whereas `this.dispatch` would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the function call.

DONE.
