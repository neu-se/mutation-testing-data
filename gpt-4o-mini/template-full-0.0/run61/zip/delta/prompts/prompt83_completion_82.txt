Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for reference equality instead of deep equality, which may incorrectly allow operations to merge when the attributes are structurally equal but not the same object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, causing the code to merge operations when the attributes are not equal, which is the opposite of the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality (==) instead of strict equality (===), which may lead to unexpected type coercion and incorrect merging of operations based on attribute values.

DONE.
