  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is not a promise, so it will not have a `dispatch` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object["dispatch"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `dispatch` property on `object` instead of calling the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `promiseDispatch` method on `object` instead of the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
