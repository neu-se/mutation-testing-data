 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always use the length of the next operation in `otherIter` instead of the minimum length between `thisIter` and `otherIter`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will use a length that is 1 less than the length of the next operation in `thisIter`, potentially causing incorrect composition of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
firstOther.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it will use a retain value that is 1 less than the actual retain value of the first operation in `otherIter`, potentially causing incorrect composition of operations.

DONE.
