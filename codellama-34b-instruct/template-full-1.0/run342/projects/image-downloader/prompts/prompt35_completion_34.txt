  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.on('data', (chunk) => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the response data to the destination file stream, whereas this new code fragment does not pipe any data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.unpipe()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the response data to the destination file stream, whereas this new code fragment unpipes the data, effectively stopping the transfer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the response data to the destination file stream, whereas this new code fragment pauses the data transfer, effectively halting the transfer.

DONE.
