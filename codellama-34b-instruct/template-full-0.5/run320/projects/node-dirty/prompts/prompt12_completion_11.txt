  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase()` would change the key to uppercase, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would append the string 'foo' to the key, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the key to null, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
