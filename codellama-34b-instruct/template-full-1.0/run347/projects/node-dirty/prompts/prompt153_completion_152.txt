  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cork the write stream again, even if it was already corked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.unpipe();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the write stream from the pipeline, potentially causing issues with data flow.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would destroy the write stream, potentially causing issues with data flow and resource cleanup.

DONE.
