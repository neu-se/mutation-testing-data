  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.source.promiseDispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the promise to the source promise instead of the resolved promise, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the code that handles the promise resolution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind(resolvedPromise).apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bind the promise dispatch method to a different object, potentially changing the context in which it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.constructor.prototype.promiseDispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would dispatch the promise using the prototype of the constructor function, rather than the instance of the promise. This could lead to ambiguous behavior in the code that handles the promise resolution.

DONE.
