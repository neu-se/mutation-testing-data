  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
# This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise immediately, without waiting for the callback to be called.
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
# This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise immediately, without waiting for the callback to be called.
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.something
# This would result in different behavior because "something" is not a valid property of a promise deferred object.
```

DONE.
