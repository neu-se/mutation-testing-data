  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be passed to `Q.fapply()` with a different first argument, potentially changing the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be passed to `Q.fapply()` with a different last argument, potentially changing the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements of `nodeArgs` except the first, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be passed to `Q.fapply()` with a different first argument, potentially changing
