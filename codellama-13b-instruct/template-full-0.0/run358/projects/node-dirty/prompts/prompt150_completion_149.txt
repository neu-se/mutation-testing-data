  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call without any arguments, while `cb(null)` is a function call with a single argument `null`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the `cb` function is implemented.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call without any arguments, while `cb(undefined)` is a function call with a single argument `undefined`. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on how the `cb` function is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('test'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call without any arguments, while `cb(new Error('test'))` is a function call with a single argument `new Error('test')`,
