  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of a country object, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).allTimezones }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezone objects instead of a country object, which would cause the `deliverCountry` function to fail.

DONE.
