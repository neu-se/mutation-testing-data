  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `false` would always return `false`, even if the array has more elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `null` would always return `null`, even if the array has more elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` would always return `true`, while the new code fragment `array[i++]` would return the next element in the array, even if the array has more elements.

DONE.
