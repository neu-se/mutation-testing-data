  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid_timezone"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return `null` instead of a valid timezone object, leading to errors in the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"UTC" + tzName
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name, leading to errors in the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would return a timezone object with a different name, leading to errors in the `getCountriesForTimezone` function.

DONE.
