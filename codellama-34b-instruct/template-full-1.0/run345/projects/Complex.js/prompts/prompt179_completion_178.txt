  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is not the same as `d` in terms of numeric values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max(a, b)` is not the same as `d` in terms of numeric values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a % b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `(a % b)` is not the same as `d` in terms of numeric values.

DONE.
