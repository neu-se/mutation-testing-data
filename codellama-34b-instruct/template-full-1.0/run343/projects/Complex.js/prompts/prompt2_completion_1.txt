  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always evaluate to 0, regardless of the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would add 1 to the value of `x`, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would subtract 1 from the value of `x`, which could change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
