  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ + cos(φ1) * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to `φ1` before multiplying it with `cosδ`, whereas in the original code, `sin(φ1)` is multiplied with `cosδ` before adding it to the other term.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sinδ * cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be applied to `φ1` before multiplying it with `sinδ`, whereas in the original code, `cos(φ1)` is multiplied with `sinδ` before adding it to the other term.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cosδ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function would be applied to `φ1` before multiplying it with `cosδ`,
