  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise, whereas `tap` is a method that returns the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return promise; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` takes a callback function that is called with the fulfilled value of the promise, and returns a new promise that is resolved with the return value of the callback. In this case, the callback function returns the original promise, so the new promise will be resolved with the original promise, which is not the same as the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(promise).then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` takes a callback function that is called with the fulfilled value of the promise, and returns a new promise that
