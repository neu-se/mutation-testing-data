 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of the Array object, which may not work correctly with non-Array objects or objects without a length property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].concat.apply([], arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `concat` method to merge the arguments array, which may not work correctly with non-Array objects or objects without a length property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `slice` method of the Array object, which may not work correctly with non-Array objects or objects without a length property. Additionally, it does not include the first argument, which is the `object` in the original code.

DONE.
