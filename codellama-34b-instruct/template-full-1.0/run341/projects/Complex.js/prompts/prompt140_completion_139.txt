  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex.NAN` for any non-zero values of a and b, whereas the original code fragment would only return `Complex.NAN` if `a` and `b` were both infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isZero']() && z['isZero']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex.NAN` for any non-zero value of `a` or `b`, whereas the original code fragment would only return `Complex.NAN` if both `a` and `b` were zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex.NAN` for any finite value of `a
