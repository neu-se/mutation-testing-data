  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments in the array would be reversed, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being added to the array, which could cause the function to fail if it does not expect extra arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[name, nodeArgs.slice(1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument is being sliced, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on the second argument being a specific length.

DONE.
