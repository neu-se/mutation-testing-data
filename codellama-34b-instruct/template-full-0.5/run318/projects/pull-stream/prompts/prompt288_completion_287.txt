  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the original `data` value to the callback, while the new code fragment `end, null` passes `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the original `data` value to the callback, while the new code fragment `end, undefined` passes `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, mapper(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end, data` passes the original `data` value to the callback, while the new code fragment `end, mapper(data)` passes the result of the `mapper` function applied to the `data` value instead.

DONE.
