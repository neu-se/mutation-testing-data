  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls it with a single string argument `'error'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls it with a single number argument `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb({})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with no arguments, while this code fragment calls it with a single object argument `{}`.

DONE.
