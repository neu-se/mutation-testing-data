  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than `&&`, so the expression would evaluate to `true` instead of `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator has higher precedence than `||`, so the expression would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`.

DONE.
