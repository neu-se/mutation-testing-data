  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never run, as the condition `i < length` would be false from the start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only run once, and `i` would be equal to `length - 1` throughout the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `i` would be twice the length of the `arguments` array, and the loop would run more times than necessary.

DONE.
