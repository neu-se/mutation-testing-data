  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check the length of the coordinates array, which is not checked in the original code. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError if the coordinates array has a length other than 2, even if the type is 'Point'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw a TypeError if the type is not 'Point' and the coordinates array has a length other than 2. This would allow the code to pass if the type is 'Point' and the coordinates array has a length other than 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' && point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw a TypeError if the type
