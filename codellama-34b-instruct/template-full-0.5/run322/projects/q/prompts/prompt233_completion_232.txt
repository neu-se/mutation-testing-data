  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and arguments, while `apply` is a method that calls a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments. Using `call` instead of `apply` would result in the function being called with the wrong arguments, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` is a method that creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` value set to the first argument and the arguments set to the remaining arguments. Using `bind` instead of `apply` would result in the function being called with the wrong `this` value and arguments, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
