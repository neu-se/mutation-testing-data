  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method invocation on a `Promise` object, which is not possible with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method invocation on a `Promise` object, which is not possible with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).dispatch` is a method invocation on a `Promise` object, which is not possible with a number.

DONE.
