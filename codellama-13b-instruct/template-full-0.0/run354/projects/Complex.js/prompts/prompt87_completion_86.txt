  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the input is `NaN`, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isNaN` is used to check if the input is `NaN`, but in this case, it is used to check if the input is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that it checks not only for the value of the input, but also its type. In the original code, the `===` operator is used to check if the input is `undefined`, but in this case, it is used to check if the input is `undefined` or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, which means that it checks not only for the
