  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to zero.

DONE.
