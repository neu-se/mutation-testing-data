  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' which is a valid protocol for URLs, while 'https://' is a different protocol that is not valid for all URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' which is a valid protocol for URLs, while 'ftp://' is a different protocol that is not valid for all URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a placeholder value that is meant to be replaced with a valid URL, while 'example.com' is a valid URL that would be used in place of the placeholder.

DONE.
