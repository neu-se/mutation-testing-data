 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl.domain.toString() === pageurl.domain.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the domain property to a string using the `toString()` method, which might not behave the same as the strict equality `==` comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl.domain.localeCompare(pageurl.domain) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `localeCompare()` method to compare the domain property, which might not behave the same as the strict equality `==` comparison.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl.hasOwnProperty('domain') && linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `domain` property exists in the `linkurl` object before performing the equality comparison, which might not be the case in some scenarios, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
