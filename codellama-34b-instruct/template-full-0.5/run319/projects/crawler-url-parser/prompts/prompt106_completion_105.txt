  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, currentUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` would not be updated with the new URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.delete(currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` would be updated to remove the new URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap` would be emptied, removing all URLs.

DONE.
