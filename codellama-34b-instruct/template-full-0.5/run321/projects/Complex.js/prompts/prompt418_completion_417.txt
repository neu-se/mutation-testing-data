  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if the complex number is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isZero`, so the code would return `Complex.INFINITY` if the complex number is not zero, and `Complex.ZERO` if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) < 1e-10 && Math.abs(this['im']) < 1e-10
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both smaller than a small positive number (1e-10), which is a different condition than checking if the complex number is zero.
