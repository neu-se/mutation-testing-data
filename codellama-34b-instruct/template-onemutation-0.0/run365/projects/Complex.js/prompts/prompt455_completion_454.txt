  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is not a number. In this case, the `isNaN` check is used to determine if the complex number is not on the Riemann sphere, so replacing it with `isFinite` would cause the method to return the wrong result.

DONE.
