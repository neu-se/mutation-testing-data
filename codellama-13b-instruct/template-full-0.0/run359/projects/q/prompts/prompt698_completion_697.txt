  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, causing the `fbind` function to return a function that always returns a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing only the first argument, causing the `fbind` function to return a function that always returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing only the first two arguments, causing the `fbind` function to return a function that always returns a rejected promise.

DONE.
