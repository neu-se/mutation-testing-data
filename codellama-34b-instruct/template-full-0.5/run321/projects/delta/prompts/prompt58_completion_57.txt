  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if a value is an array, while `!Array.isArray` checks if a value is not an array. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `ops` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isObject` checks if a value is an object, while `Array.isArray` checks if a value is an array. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `ops` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops) && ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ops` is an array and its length is greater than 0. This change would cause the code to behave differently when `ops` is an array with a length of 0.
