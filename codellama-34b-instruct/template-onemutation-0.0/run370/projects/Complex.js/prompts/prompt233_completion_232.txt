  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a subtraction operation, while the replacement code fragment has an addition operation. This would cause the resulting value to be different, leading to different behavior in the surrounding code.
