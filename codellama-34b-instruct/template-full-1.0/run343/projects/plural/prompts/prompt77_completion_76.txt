  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice', 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element in the array is swapped with the second, which would result in a different plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 'loads'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element in the array is different from the second, which would result in a different plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gas', 'gases'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element in the array is different from the second, which would result in a different plural form of the word.

DONE.
