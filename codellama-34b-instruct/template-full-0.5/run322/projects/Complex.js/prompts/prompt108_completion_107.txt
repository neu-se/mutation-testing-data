  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN(z['re']) && !isNaN(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this replacement checks if both are not NaN.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite(z['re']) || isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this replacement checks if either is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN(z['re']) || isFinite(z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if either `z['re']` or `z['im']` is NaN, while this replacement checks if `z['re']` is NaN or `z['im']` is
