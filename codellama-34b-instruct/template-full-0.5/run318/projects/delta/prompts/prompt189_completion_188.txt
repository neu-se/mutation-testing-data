  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only adds the `attributes` property to the new op if it is not null, while this modified code adds the `attributes` property only if it is not null and has a length greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only adds the `attributes` property to the new op if it is not null, while this modified code adds the `attributes` property only if it is not null and has a length greater than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes || attributes.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only adds the `attributes` property to the new op if it is not null, while this modified code adds the `attributes` property only if it is null or has a length of 0.
