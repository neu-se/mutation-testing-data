  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"progress"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string "progress" is not a valid value for the `progress` property, and would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the value 0 is not a valid value for the `progress` property, and would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value null is not a valid value for the `progress` property, and would likely cause an error.

DONE.
