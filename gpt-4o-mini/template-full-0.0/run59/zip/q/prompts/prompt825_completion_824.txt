Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to receive `null` instead of the original `promise`, potentially leading to incorrect stack traces or unhandled errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `makeStackTraceLong` would not provide the necessary context of the original promise, which could lead to misleading error handling or debugging information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the original promise with a string, which could cause `makeStackTraceLong` to fail or behave unexpectedly, as it likely expects a promise object rather than a string.

DONE.
