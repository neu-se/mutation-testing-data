  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the result of `sin(θ)` will be different from `cos(θ)` for most values of `θ`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the result of `tan(θ)` will be different from `cos(θ)` for most values of `θ`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `acos` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and the result of `acos(x)` will be different from `cos(x)` for most values of `x`.

DONE.
