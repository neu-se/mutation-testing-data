  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different error code, which could cause the code to behave differently in the case of an access error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTFOUND'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different error code, which could cause the code to behave differently in the case of a file not found error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EISDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different error code, which could cause the code to behave differently in the case of a directory being passed as the file path.

DONE.
