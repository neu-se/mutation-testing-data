  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the end of the arguments array, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, "foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the end of the arguments array, which could cause the method to be called with the wrong number of arguments.

DONE.
