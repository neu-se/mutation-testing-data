  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called twice, which would cause the promise to be rejected twice, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function () {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
