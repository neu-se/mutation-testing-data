Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!fs.existsSync(srcFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the source file instead of the destination file, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file copying.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.existsSync(destFile) && clobber === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it only throws an error or unlinks the destination file when clobber is false, potentially allowing unintended overwriting of files when clobber is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it always assumes the destination file exists, potentially leading to incorrect handling of file copying, such as always attempting to unlink the destination file or always throwing an error.

DONE.
