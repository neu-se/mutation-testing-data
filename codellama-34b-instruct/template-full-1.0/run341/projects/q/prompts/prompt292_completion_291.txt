  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () { return deferred.notify }).call();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.call()` method is used to call the `deferred.notify` method immediately, instead of passing it as a reference to be called later. This would cause the `deferred.notify` method to be called immediately, and the resulting value would be passed to `Q.denodeify`, which could lead to errors if the method is not designed to be called in that way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(deferred.notify).bind(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.bind()` method is used to bind the `deferred.notify` method to the `deferred` object, which could cause the method to behave differently if it relies on the binding to function correctly. For example, if the method uses `this` to refer to the `deferred` object, using `.bind()` could cause the method to fail if it is called in a different context.

Option 3
