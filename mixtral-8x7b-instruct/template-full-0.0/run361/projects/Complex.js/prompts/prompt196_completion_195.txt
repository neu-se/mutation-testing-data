 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result of the sine function would be different, as it takes the input in radians and 1 is not the original value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would receive the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part, causing a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function would receive a constant value instead of the imaginary part of the complex number, causing a different output.

DONE.
