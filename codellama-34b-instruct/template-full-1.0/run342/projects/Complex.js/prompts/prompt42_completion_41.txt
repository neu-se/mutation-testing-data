  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b + a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication order has changed, which would result in a different value for the log function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b + b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication order has changed, which would result in a different value for the log function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b + a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation has been omitted, which would result in a different value for the log function.

DONE.
