 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'0' as any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the embedType to be a string, which could cause issues if the handler is expecting a number or another type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'embedType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always assign the string 'embedType' to the embedType variable, instead of getting the actual key from the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random().toString(36).substr(2)
