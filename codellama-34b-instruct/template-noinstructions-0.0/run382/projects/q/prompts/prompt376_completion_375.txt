  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(newValue);
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is not a function, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `value` is the original value passed to the `progressed` callback, and may not be the same as `newValue`, which is the transformed value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(inspected.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because `inspected.value` is the fulfillment value of the promise, and may not be the same as `newValue`, which is the transformed value.

DONE.
