  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called even if the `src` parameter is not a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the first argument passed to `bind()`. In this case, the `this` keyword would be set to `null`, which would cause the `isGlob` function to be called with the global object as its `this` value, rather than the `src` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.call(null, src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call()` method calls a function with a specified `this` value and arguments.
