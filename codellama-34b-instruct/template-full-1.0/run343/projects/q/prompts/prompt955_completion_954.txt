  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fbind.call(callback, thisp, callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind` is not the same as `Q.fbind` and `Q.fbind.call` does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.bind(bound, bound).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.bind` and `Q.fapply` do not exist.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fbind(bound).bind(bound).fapply
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fbind` and `Q.fapply` do not exist.

DONE.
