  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be doubled, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance - 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be reduced by 100 meters, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
distance + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the distance calculation would be increased by 100 meters, which would cause the destination point to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
