  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment negates the value of `cb`, which evaluates to a falsey value if `cb` is not a function. On the other hand, the new code fragment double-negates the value of `cb`, which would evaluate to a truthy value if `cb` is a function, and a falsey value if `cb` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy, whereas the new code fragment checks if `cb` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb && acc !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy and `acc` is truthy, whereas the new code fragment checks if `cb` is falsy and `acc` is not null.
