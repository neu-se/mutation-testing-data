  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'read_close'` event when the read stream is closed, but the replaced code would emit the `'error'` event instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'read_close'` event when the read stream is closed, but the replaced code would emit the `'write_close'` event instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the `'read_close'` event when the read stream is closed, but the replaced code would emit the `'drain'` event instead.

DONE.
