  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the `cb` function, causing the `empty` stream to never end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` function is called instead of the `cb` function, which could cause the `empty` stream to never end or to end prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a function and would cause an error to be thrown when the `empty` stream is used.

DONE.
