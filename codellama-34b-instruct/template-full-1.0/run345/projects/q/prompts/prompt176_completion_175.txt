  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different character to separate the lines of the stack trace, and could potentially cause issues with the formatting of the trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<br>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different character to separate the lines of the stack trace, and could potentially cause issues with the formatting of the trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different character to separate the lines of the stack trace, and could potentially cause issues with the formatting of the trace.

DONE.
