Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, causing the code to execute the optimization when the last operation is not equal, which could lead to incorrect concatenation of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `delta` has no operations instead of checking if the last operation is equal, potentially skipping the optimization when it should not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if there are remaining operations in `thisIter`, which could lead to incorrect handling of the remaining operations and affect the final result of the `compose` method.

DONE.
