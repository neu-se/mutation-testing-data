  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { throw new Error("Error message"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to throw an error, rather than returning a handler for the specified embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => "hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return the string "hello", rather than returning a handler for the specified embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to return `undefined`, rather than returning a handler for the specified embed type.

DONE.
