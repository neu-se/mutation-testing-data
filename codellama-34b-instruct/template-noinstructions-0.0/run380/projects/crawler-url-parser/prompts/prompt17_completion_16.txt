  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces it with a space.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces it with a question mark.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, '&'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the fragment identifier from the URL, while the new code fragment replaces it with an ampersand.

DONE.
