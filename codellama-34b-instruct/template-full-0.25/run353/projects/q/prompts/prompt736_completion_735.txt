  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (promises) {
    return all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        promise = Q(promise);
        function regardless() {
            return promise.inspect();
        }
    }));
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called for each promise, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(function (promises) {
    return all(array_map(promises, function (promise) {
        promise = Q(promise);
        function regardless() {
            return promise.inspect();
        }
    }));
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` function would be called for each promise, regardless of whether it was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
