  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with an empty string as the argument, which would cause the `emit` function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
8
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with the number 8 as the argument, which would cause the `emit` function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `load` event to be emitted with null as the argument, which would cause the `emit` function to throw an error.

DONE.
