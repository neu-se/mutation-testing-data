Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
','
```
This would result in different behavior because using a comma instead of a pipe will create a single string with all the words concatenated together, which will not match any of the pluralized words correctly, leading to incorrect pluralization results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
';'
```
This would result in different behavior because using a semicolon will break the regular expression into separate statements, causing it to not match any of the pluralized words, thus returning the original word without pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'| '
```
This would result in different behavior because adding a space after the pipe will change the matching criteria, potentially causing the regex to fail to match words that should be pluralized, resulting in incorrect pluralization behavior.

DONE.
