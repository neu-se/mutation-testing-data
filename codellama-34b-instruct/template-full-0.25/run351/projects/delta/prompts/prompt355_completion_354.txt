  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `this.transformPosition(arg, priority)` instead of `other.ops` when `arg` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `this.transformPosition(arg, priority)` instead of `other.ops` when `arg` is a negative number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always return `this.transformPosition(arg, priority)` instead of `other.ops` when `arg` is an even number.

DONE.
