  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.split
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, while the `match` method returns an array of matches.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method returns a new string with the specified replacement, while the `match` method returns an array of matches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.search
```
This would result in different behavior because the `search` method returns the index of the first match, while the `match` method returns an array of matches.

DONE.
