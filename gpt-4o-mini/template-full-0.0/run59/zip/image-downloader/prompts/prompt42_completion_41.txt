Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error('Request timed out'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a generic error instead of a specific `TimeoutError`, which may not be caught or handled differently in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new TimeoutError('Timeout occurred'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the message of the `TimeoutError`, which could lead to tests that check for specific error messages to pass incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject('Timeout')
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects with a string instead of an instance of `TimeoutError`, which could cause type-related issues in error handling and may not be caught by tests expecting an error object.

DONE.
