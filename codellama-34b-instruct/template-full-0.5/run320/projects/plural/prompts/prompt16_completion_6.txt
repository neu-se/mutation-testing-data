  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 1 from the word length, while this new code fragment does not. This would cause the `substr` method to return the entire word, rather than just the last letter, which would result in incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 1 from the word length, while this new code fragment subtracts 2. This would cause the `substr` method to return the last two letters of the word, rather than just the last letter, which would result in incorrect pluralization.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment subtracts 1 from the word length, while this new code fragment subtracts 2. This would cause the `substr`
