  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
; index > length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would run in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
; index += 2; index < length; index--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip every other element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
; index < length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra iteration would occur.

DONE.
