  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.path
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.path` is a string containing the pathname of the URL, whereas `ret.host` is a string containing the hostname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.protocol` is a string containing the protocol of the URL, whereas `ret.host` is a string containing the hostname.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ret.port
```
This would result in different behavior because `ret.port` is a number containing the port number of the URL, whereas `ret.host` is a string containing the hostname.

DONE.
