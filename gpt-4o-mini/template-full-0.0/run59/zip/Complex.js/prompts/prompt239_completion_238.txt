Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` calculates the cube root instead of the square root, leading to incorrect results when computing the imaginary part of the complex square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly computes the square root of the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the correct calculation based on the magnitude of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(r - a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an arbitrary constant (1) into the calculation, which alters the expected result of the square root and can lead to incorrect values for the imaginary part.

DONE.
