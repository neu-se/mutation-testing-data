  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the buggy code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors and also calls the `reject` method on the `deferred` object. This could cause the `deferred` object to be rejected with an error, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `fail` method to handle errors, while the buggy code fragment uses the `then` method to handle errors and also calls the `resolve` method on the `deferred` object. This could cause the `deferred` object to be resolved with a value, which could affect the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can
