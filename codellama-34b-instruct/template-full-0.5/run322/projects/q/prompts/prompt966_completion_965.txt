  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression in JavaScript, but `null` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression in JavaScript, but `undefined` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a valid expression in JavaScript, but `1` is not.

DONE.
