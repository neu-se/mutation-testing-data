  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 !thisIter.hasNext
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation causes the while loop to never execute, as the condition !thisIter.hasNext will always be false if there are no next elements in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation causes the while loop to never terminate, as the condition thisIter.hasNext will always be true if there are next elements in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() < index
```
This would result in different behavior because the mutation causes the while loop to terminate early, potentially leaving out some ops that would have been applied if the original condition was used.

DONE.
