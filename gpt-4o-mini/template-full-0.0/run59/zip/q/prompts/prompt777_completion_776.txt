Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.value` would attempt to access a non-existent property on the promise object, leading to `undefined` being returned instead of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(() => 'fulfilled', () => 'rejected')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would return a string indicating the promise's state rather than the actual state object, which could lead to incorrect handling of the promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(() => 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because this code fragment would only handle rejections and return a string 'error' instead of the promise's state, ignoring fulfilled states entirely.

DONE.
