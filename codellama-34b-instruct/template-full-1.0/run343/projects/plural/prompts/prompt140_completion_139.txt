  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the first matching rule (i.e., the rule whose regex matches the input word) to be applied instead of the second matching rule (i.e., the rule whose match value is a function).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the last matching rule (i.e., the rule whose regex matches the input word) to be applied instead of the second matching rule (i.e., the rule whose match value is a function).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof rule[1] === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the second matching rule (i.e., the rule whose match value is a function) to be applied only if its match value is a function instead of a regular expression.

DONE.
