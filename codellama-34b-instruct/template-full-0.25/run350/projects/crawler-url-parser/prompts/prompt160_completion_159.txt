  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the last part of the URL path, while the new code fragment uses a string replacement to remove the last part of the URL path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, "\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the last part of the URL path, while the new code fragment uses a string replacement to remove the last part of the URL path.
