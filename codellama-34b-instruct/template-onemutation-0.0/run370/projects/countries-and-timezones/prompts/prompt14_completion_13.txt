  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.assign` method is used to merge the `result` object with a new object, but the new object is not being created correctly. The `Object.assign` method takes two arguments, the first is the target object and the second is the source object, but in this case, the source object is not being created correctly.

DONE.
