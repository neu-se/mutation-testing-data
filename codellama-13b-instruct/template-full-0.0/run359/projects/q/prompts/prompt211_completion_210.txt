  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `this` context set to the `deferred` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `this` context set to the `promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to call the `callback` function with the `this` context set to the `deferred` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `apply` method to call the `callback` function with the `this` context set to the `promise` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(this)(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is used to create a new function that
