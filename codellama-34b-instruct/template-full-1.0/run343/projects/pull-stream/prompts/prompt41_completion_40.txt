  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(null, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply` with a `this` value of `null` will not work correctly with the current implementation of `pull`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(read, ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply` with a `this` value of `read` will not work correctly with the current implementation of `pull`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pull.apply(ref[0], ref)
```
This would result in different behavior because `pull.apply` with a `this` value of `ref[0]` will not work correctly with the current implementation of `pull`.

DONE.
