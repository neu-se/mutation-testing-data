  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekType` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without parentheses returns the type of the iterator itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekType` without parentheses returns the type of the iterator itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method advances the iterator to the next operation, while `peekType` without parentheses returns the type of the iterator itself.

DONE.
