  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `line` variable is defined, but by replacing it with `undefined`, the check will always fail, causing the `if` statement to execute the `return` statement, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `line` variable is not null, but by replacing it with `null`, the check will always pass, causing the `if` statement to execute the `return` statement, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `line` variable is not an empty string, but by replacing it with an empty string, the check will always pass, causing the `if` statement to execute the `return` statement, which would result in a different behavior.
