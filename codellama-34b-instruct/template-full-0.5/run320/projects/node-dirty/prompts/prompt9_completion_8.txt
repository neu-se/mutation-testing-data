  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the key would be set to undefined, even if a value was provided in the `val` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, val
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the key would be set to undefined, even if a value was provided in the `val` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the key would be set to the sum of the original value and 1, even if a different value was provided in the `val` argument.

DONE.
