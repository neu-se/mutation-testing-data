 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for both `null` and `undefined`, while the original code only checks for `undefined`. This could cause false negatives in the `matches` method if a property is explicitly set to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== undefined && match[index + 1] !== prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next element in the `match` array is not `undefined` and not equal to `prop`, while the original code only checks if it's not equal to `prop`. This could cause false negatives in the `matches` method if the `match` array contains `undefined` values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match[index + 1] !== this.regex.props[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the next element in the `match`
