  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would change the way the regular expression is applied to the input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is a different method than `match`, and it would change the way the regular expression is applied to the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.exec
```
This would result in different behavior because `exec` is a different method than `match`, and it would change the way the regular expression is applied to the input string.

DONE.
