  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 1, rather than 0, potentially missing the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the last index of the array, rather than the first, potentially causing the loop to only execute once or not at all.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at a negative index, which would be out of bounds of the array, potentially causing the loop to crash or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
