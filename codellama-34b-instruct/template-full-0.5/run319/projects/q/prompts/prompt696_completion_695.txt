  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_splice` is a function that removes and replaces elements in an array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(1)` would return a slice of the array starting from the second element, whereas the original code would return a slice of the array starting from the first element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(0, 1)` would return a slice of the array containing only the first element, whereas the original code would return a slice of the array containing all elements.

DONE.
