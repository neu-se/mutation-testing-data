  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/([.$])/g, '$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment escapes the `$` character, which is a special character in regular expressions, while the new code fragment does not. This means that the new code fragment would match a literal `$` character in the input string, while the original code fragment would not.

DONE.
