  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first word of the text, while the original code returned the entire text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text in uppercase letters, while the original code returned the text as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text with the words reversed, while the original code returned the text as is.

DONE.
