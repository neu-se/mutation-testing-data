  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `getNumStr(min)` with `min` being the remainder of `offset` divided by 60, which is always between 0 and 59. By calling `getNumStr(10)` instead, the function will receive a constant input of 10, which will produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(Math.abs(min))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls `getNumStr(min)` with the signed remainder of `offset` divided by 60, while this code fragment calls `getNumStr` with the absolute value of `min`. This will produce different results when `min` is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced
