  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().slice(0, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `trim()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the text, while the new code fragment uses `slice()` to extract the first three characters of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the case of the text, while the new code fragment uses `toLowerCase()` to convert the text to lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().split(" ").join("_")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the text, while the new code fragment uses `split()` and `join()` to replace spaces with underscores.

DONE.
