  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would be `true` for any non-empty string, while `rowStr.length === 0` would only be `true` for an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.trim().length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would be `true` for any string that only contains whitespace, while `rowStr.trim().length === 0` would only be `true` for an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.match(/^\s*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!rowStr` would be `true` for any string that only contains whitespace, while `rowStr.match(/^\s*$/)` would only be `true` for an empty string.

DONE.
