  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is the opposite of `ses.ok`, so it would negate the check for whether the current environment is a SES environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ses.ok
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the check for whether the current environment is a SES environment, so it would check for whether the current environment is not a SES environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.maybeOk
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for whether the current environment is a SES environment, but it would also allow for the possibility that the environment may not be a SES environment.

DONE.
