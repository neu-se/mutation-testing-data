  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isZero']`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `this['isZero']` is `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `()` operator would attempt to call the `this['isZero']` property as a function, which would throw an error if it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'] = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` operator would assign the value `false` to the `this['isZero']` property, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` regardless of the original value of `this['isZero']`.

DONE.
