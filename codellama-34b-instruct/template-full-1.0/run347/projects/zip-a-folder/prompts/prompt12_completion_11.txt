  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.W);
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.constants.W` is a flag for write access, but the code is actually trying to check if the file can be read.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R | fs.constants.W);
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking if the file can be read or written, but the `access` method should only be used to check for one kind of access at a time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R | fs.constants.X);
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is now checking if the file can be read
