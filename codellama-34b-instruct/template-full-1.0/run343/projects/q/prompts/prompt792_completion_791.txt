  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function () { throw new Error("My custom error message"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message will be thrown for any rejected promises, rather than the original error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function () { return Q.reject("My custom rejection"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom rejection will be returned for any rejected promises, rather than the original rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, function () { return "My custom resolution"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom resolution will be returned for any fulfilled promises, rather than the original resolution.

DONE.
