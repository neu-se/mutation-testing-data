/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/g, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added to the regular expression, which makes it case-insensitive, and the function returns the uppercase version of the matched word.

Option 3: The PLACE
