  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reassign the `_b` variable to `0`, effectively changing the output of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `a` and `b` variables instead of multiplying them, resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the call to `hypot` with a call to `Math.sqrt`, changing the way the function computes the square root.

DONE.
