  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled  
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled` does not exist, so the code would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allSettled"  
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for the string "allSettled" and not a function that can be applied to an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function allSettled() {  
    return promises.allResolved();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` does not exist, so the code would throw an error.

DONE.
