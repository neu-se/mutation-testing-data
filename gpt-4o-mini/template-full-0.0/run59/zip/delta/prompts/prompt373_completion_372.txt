Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to advance by one operation regardless of the actual length of the current operation, potentially skipping over important operations that should be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does not advance the iterator at all, causing the same operation to be processed repeatedly and potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to advance the iterator by one more than the actual length of the current operation, which could lead to skipping the last part of the operation and incorrect handling of the delta transformations.

DONE.
