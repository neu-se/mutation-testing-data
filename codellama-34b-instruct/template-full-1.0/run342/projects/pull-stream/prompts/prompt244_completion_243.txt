  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err || abort)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with the `abort` argument, which would cause the stream to be aborted immediately, rather than waiting for the `_read` function to be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err && abort)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would short-circuit the `read` function if both `err` and `abort` are truthy, causing the stream to be aborted immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
read(abort, function(err) {
  cb(err ? abort : null)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to be called with the `abort` argument if
