  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` could be `undefined`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even though `op.insert` is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` could be `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even though `op.insert` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` could be a string, but it could also be `undefined` or `null`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even though `op.insert` is a string.

DONE.
