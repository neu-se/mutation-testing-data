  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` expects an event name as the first argument, but `null` is being passed. This would cause an error to be emitted instead of the expected `read_close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close')
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` expects an event name as the first argument, but `null` is being passed. This would cause an error to be emitted instead of the expected `read_close` event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` expects an event name as the first argument, but `null` is being passed. This would cause an error to be emitted instead of the expected `read_close` event.

DONE.
