  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the power of 2 to the zoom level, while this code calculates the power of 2 to one less than the zoom level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the power of 2 to the zoom level, while this code calculates the power of 2 to one more than the zoom level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(3, zoom)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the power of 2 to the zoom level, while this code calculates the power of 3 to the zoom level.

DONE.
