  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `null` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `[]` is an empty array, which would result in a different slice of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects an array as its second argument, but `[1, 2, 3]` is a different array than the original, which would result in a different slice of the original array.

DONE.
