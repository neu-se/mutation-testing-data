  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a deferred object and returns its promise, while the new code fragment creates a deferred object, resolves its promise, and returns the resolved value. This change would cause the `put` method to resolve the promise immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method.

DONE.
