  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause the function to receive no arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an array containing specific values would cause the function to receive those values as arguments, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an array
