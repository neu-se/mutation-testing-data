  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because `end !== true` is always true, while `end` is a boolean value that can be either true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `acc = null` would set the `acc` variable to null, while the original code fragment would set it to the value of the `data` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sink(source)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sink(source)` would call the `sink` function with the `source` parameter, while the original code fragment would not call any function.

DONE.
