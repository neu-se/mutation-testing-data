  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pop` method to be called with an incorrect argument, leading to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pop` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which would affect the behavior of the `pop` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop(this.ops.length - 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `pop` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which would affect the behavior of the `pop` method.

DONE.
