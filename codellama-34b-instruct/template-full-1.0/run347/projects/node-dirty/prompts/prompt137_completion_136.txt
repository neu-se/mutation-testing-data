  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  this._data.set
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set the value to the same key, instead of getting the value and checking if it's undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  this._data.has
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check if the key is present in the data object, instead of getting the value and checking if it's undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always get the value for the key, instead of checking if the value is undefined.

DONE.
