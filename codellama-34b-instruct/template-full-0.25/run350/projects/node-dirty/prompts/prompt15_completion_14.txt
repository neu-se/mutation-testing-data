  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an undefined value, which could cause the test to fail even if the code is working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would be called with an empty function, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is not working correctly.

DONE.
