  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods. If the `replacer` function is called with `null` as the argument, it will not be able to access the properties or methods of the original object, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have properties or methods. If the `replacer` function is called with `undefined` as the argument, it will not be able to access the properties or methods of the original object, which could cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` is an object, but `{}` is an empty object that does not have the
