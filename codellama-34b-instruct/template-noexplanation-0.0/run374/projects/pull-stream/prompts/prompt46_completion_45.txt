  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This change will cause the loop to start from the first element instead of the second, which may cause the loop to skip over some elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This change will cause the loop to start from the last element instead of the second, which may cause the loop to skip over some elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(length / 2)
```
This change will cause the loop to start from the middle element instead of the second, which may cause the loop to skip over some elements.

DONE.
