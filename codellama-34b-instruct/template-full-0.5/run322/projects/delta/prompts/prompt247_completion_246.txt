  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the current operation, and adding 1 to it would cause the operation to be treated as one unit longer than it actually is. This could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the current operation, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the operation to be treated as one unit shorter than it actually is. This could lead to incorrect results in the `diff` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `opLength` variable is used to determine the length of the current operation, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the operation to be treated as twice as long as it actually is. This
