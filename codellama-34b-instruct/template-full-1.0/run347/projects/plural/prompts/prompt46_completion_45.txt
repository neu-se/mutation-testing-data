  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a vowel "y", but this replacement matches words that end with a consonant "y".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]|o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a vowel "y", but this replacement matches words that end with either a vowel "y" or the letter "o".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]|(o)$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches words that end with a vowel "y", but this replacement matches words that end with either a vowel "y" or the letter "o", and captures the "o" in a group.

DONE.
