Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of `data` would cause the callback to receive `undefined` as the second argument, which may lead to unexpected results in the calling function that expects the original `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because returning a string `'error'` instead of `data` would change the type of the second argument in the callback, potentially causing type-related issues in the consuming code that expects the original `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `data + 1` instead of `data` would modify the value being passed to the callback, which could lead to incorrect processing if the consuming code relies on the original value of `data`.

DONE.
