 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 360 instead of using the provided bearing value. This can lead to unpredictable results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the bearing to 0, regardless of the provided value. This can lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, as the calculated destination will always be in the same direction (north) from the starting point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 180 to the provided bearing value. This can lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, as the calculated destination will be shifted 180 degrees from the correct direction.
