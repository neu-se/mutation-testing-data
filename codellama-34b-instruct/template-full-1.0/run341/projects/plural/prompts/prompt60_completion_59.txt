  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
'criterion'
```

This would result in different behavior because the `criterion` function has a different definition than the `criteria` function. The `criterion` function accepts a single argument `w` and returns the result of `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'a'`, while the `criteria` function accepts a single argument `w` and returns the result of `w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
'criterion' + 's'
```

This would result in different behavior because the `criterion` function has a different definition than the `criteria` function, and the `+'s'` suffix would be applied after the result of the `criterion` function has been computed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
'criterion' + 'es'
```
