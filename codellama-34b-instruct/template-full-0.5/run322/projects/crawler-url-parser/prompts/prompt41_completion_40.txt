  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `query` property of the returned `Url` object to be an empty object, rather than an object containing the query parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` argument would cause the `search` property of the returned `Url` object to be an empty string, rather than a string containing the query parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` arguments would cause the `query` and `search` properties of the returned `Url` object to be objects and strings containing the query parameters, respectively.

DONE.
