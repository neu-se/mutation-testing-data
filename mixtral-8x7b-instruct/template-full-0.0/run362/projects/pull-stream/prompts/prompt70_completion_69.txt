 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true === op(data) || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition checks for `true` instead of `false`, which reverses the logic of the condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op && false === op(data) || abort
