Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `baseOp` variable instead of the current operation `op`, potentially leading to incorrect deletions based on the base operation rather than the intended operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inverted.delete` method to be called with `null`, which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors since the method likely expects a valid operation length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete based on the retain value of the operation instead of its length, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation's effects on the delta.

DONE.
