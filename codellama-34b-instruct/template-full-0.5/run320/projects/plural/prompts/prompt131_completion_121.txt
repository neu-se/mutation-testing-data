  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the regular expression `rule[0]` matches the word, while this code fragment checks if the result of the `test()` method is equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0]) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the regular expression `rule[0]` matches the word, while this code fragment checks if the word matches the regular expression `rule[0]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.search(rule[0]) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the regular expression `rule[0]` matches the word, while this code fragment checks if the word contains the regular expression `rule[0]`.

DONE.
