  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong substring for words that end with "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", or "cactus".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1, w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong substring for words that end with "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", or "cactus".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2, w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the wrong substring for words that end with "nucleus", "syllabus", "focus", "fungus", or "cactus".

DONE.
