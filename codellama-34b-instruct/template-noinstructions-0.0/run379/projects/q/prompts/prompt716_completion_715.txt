  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "keys" method on the promise instead of the object, which would likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("values", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "values" method on the promise instead of the object, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch("entries", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "entries" method on the promise instead of the object, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
