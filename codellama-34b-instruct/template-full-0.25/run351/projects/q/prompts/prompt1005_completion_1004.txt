  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a built-in JavaScript object and `Q` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current object, while `Q` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and `Q` is a function.

DONE.
