 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise might resolve with a null value, whereas the original code doesn't pass any argument to `deferred.resolve()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise would be rejected instead of being resolved, which is the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` would create a new resolved promise, but it would not reference the `promises` array, which is the expected behavior in the original code.

DONE.
