  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'batrrium', 'batrria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first string has the wrong spelling and the second string has the wrong plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'vanadium', 'vanadia'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first string is a chemical element and the second string is not a recognized plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium', 'bacterinu'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second string has the wrong spelling.

DONE.
