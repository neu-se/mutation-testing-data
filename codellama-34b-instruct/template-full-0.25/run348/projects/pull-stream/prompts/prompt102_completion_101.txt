  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the data to the standard error stream instead of the standard output stream, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the data in uppercase instead of the original case, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data.split(' ').join(''))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the data with spaces removed, which may not be what the developer intended.

DONE.
