  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the `push` method to set the key of the map to the lowercase version of the policy name, rather than the original name. This could potentially cause issues if the `get` method is called with a name that is not in the same case as the key in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `push` method to set the key of the map to the uppercase version of the policy name, rather than the original name. This could potentially cause issues if the `get` method is called with a name that is not in the same case as the key in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This change will cause the `push` method to set the key of the map to the reverse of the policy name, rather than the original name.
