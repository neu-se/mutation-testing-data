  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted()
```
This would result in different behavior because `aborted` is a function, so calling it would invoke a different behavior than passing the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a constant, so it would always evaluate to `true`, whereas `aborted` is a variable that can be `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `true`, so the conditions check would evaluate to `false`, whereas `aborted` can be either `true` or `false`.

DONE.
