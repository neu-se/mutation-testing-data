 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Handled error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error is no longer forwarded to the global `onerror` handler, but instead a new error is thrown, which would not be handled by the existing error handling mechanism.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would not be set as the error handler for the promise, and any unhandled errors would not be forwarded to the global `onerror` handler or thrown as exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
