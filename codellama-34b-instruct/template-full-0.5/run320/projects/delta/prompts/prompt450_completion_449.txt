  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' || op.retain === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null, while this new code checks if `op.retain` is a number or null. If `op.retain` is an object, this new code would return `true` even if it's not null, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'number' || op.retain === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.retain` is an object and not null, while this new code checks if `op.retain` is a number or undefined. If `op.retain` is an object, this new code would return `true` even if it's not undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
