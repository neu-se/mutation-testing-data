 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/:[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it doesn't match the trailing slash, unlike the original `/:.+/` which does match the trailing slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/:.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any character (including a newline) after the first slash, while the original `/:.+/` matches one or more characters that are not a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
/:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only matches alphanumeric characters and underscores after the first slash, while the original `/:.+/` matches any character (except a slash) after the first slash.

DONE.
