  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to include one more character than the original code, potentially resulting in a different slice being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to exclude one character from the original code, potentially resulting in a different slice being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the slice to start one character later than the original code, potentially resulting in a different slice being returned.

DONE.
