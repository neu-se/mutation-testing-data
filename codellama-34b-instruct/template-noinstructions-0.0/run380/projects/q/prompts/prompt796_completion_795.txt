  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    return value;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, but this replacement code fragment is a function that returns the progress value without doing anything with it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    throw new Error("Progress is not supported");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, but this replacement code fragment is a function that throws an error when it is called, regardless of the progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (value) {
    return value + 1;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `progressed` is a function that is called with the progress value, but this replacement code fragment is a function that returns the progress value plus 1,
