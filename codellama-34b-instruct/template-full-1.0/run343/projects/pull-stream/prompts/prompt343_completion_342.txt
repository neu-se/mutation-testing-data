  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because when the function is called with `abort` set to `true`, it would not abort the callback as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because when the function is called with `abort` set to `true`, it would not pass the `abort` value to the `onAbort` callback as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because when the function is called with `abort` set to `true`, it would not call the `onAbort` callback as intended.

DONE.
