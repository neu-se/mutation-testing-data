  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, making the function always return Complex.INFINITY, even if the original function would have returned a finite value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, making the function always return Complex.ZERO, even if the original function would have returned a non-zero value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, making the function always return Complex.INFINITY, even if the original function would have returned a finite value.

DONE.
