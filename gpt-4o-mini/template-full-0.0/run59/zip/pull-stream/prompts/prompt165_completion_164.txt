Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback invocation to pass `abort` as the second argument instead of calling `abortCb`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the abort condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the callback invocation to pass `false` instead of invoking `abortCb`, which would not properly handle the abort scenario and could lead to unexpected results in the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly passes the `abort` value to the callback instead of calling `abortCb`, which may not trigger the intended abort handling logic and could cause the application to continue processing when it should not.

DONE.
