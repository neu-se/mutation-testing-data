 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('base').attr('data-href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the 'data-href' attribute instead of the 'href' attribute of the 'base' element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('head base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it targets the 'base' element inside the 'head' element instead of targeting all 'base' elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$(el).attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it gets the 'href' attribute of the current 'el' (element) instead of the 'href' attribute of the 'a' elements.

DONE.
