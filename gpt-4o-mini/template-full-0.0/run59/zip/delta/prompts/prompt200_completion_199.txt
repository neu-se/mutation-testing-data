Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty Delta for the rest of the operations, potentially losing important operations that should be included in the final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly include one additional operation from `thisIter`, which may not be intended, leading to an incorrect composition of the Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first two operations from `thisIter`, which could lead to missing critical operations in the final Delta, altering the expected output.

DONE.
