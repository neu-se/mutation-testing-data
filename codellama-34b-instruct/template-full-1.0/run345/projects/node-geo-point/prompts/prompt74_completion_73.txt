  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(360 + θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because theAzimuth is measured clockwise from true north, so adding 360 to the angle would calculate theazimuth from due south instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because cos(θ) would calculate the adjacent side instead of the opposite side, causing a different calculation of the coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because a random angle would be used for calculation, instead of the actual azimuth between coordinates, making the calculation completely unpredictable and potentially inaccurate.

DONE.
