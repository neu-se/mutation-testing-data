  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add additional `then` handlers to the promise chain, which could affect the overall behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).catch(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error handling of the promise chain, potentially causing uncaught errors to be swallowed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(noop, noop).then(noop, noop).catch(noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add additional `then` handlers and error handling to the promise chain, potentially affecting the overall behavior of the program.

DONE.
