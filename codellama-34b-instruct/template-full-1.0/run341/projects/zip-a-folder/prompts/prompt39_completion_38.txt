  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` and `tar` methods would not be called with the expected `src` argument. Instead, they would be called with `null`, which could cause them to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` and `tar` methods would not be called with the expected `src` argument. Instead, they would be called with `undefined`, which could cause them to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `zip` and `tar` methods would not be called with the expected `src` argument. Instead, they would be called with an empty string, which could cause them to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
