Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `ref.unshift(null)` to add `null` to the beginning of the array, which would change the arguments passed to the `pull` function, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also modify the arguments passed to the `pull` function, leading to a different execution path and possibly causing the function to behave incorrectly when it expects valid arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to add `1` to the `read` variable, which may not be a number, leading to type coercion issues or unexpected results when the `pull` function is called with the modified arguments.

DONE.
