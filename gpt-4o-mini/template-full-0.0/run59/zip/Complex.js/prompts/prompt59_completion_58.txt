Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check for finiteness, causing the condition to pass for non-finite numbers (like `Infinity` or `NaN`), which would lead to incorrect handling of complex numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the number is an integer instead of checking for finiteness, which would incorrectly allow non-integer values (like fractions) to be processed without triggering the `Complex['INFINITY']` return.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['r'] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the property `r` is undefined instead of checking if `a` is finite, which would lead to incorrect parsing of complex numbers and potentially allow invalid inputs to be processed.

DONE.
