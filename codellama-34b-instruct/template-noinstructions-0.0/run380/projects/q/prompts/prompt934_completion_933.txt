  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object in non-strict mode, which is different from the original code where `this` referred to the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when called, whereas the original code would have called the `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when called, whereas the original code would have called the `Q` object.

DONE.
