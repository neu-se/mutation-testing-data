  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array.length` property to determine the length of the array, while this replacement uses the `array.length - 1` property, which would result in the last element of the array being skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable to iterate over the elements of the array, while this replacement uses the `array.slice(1)` method to create a new array that contains all elements of the original array except the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.map(function (x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `array` variable to iterate over the elements of the array, while this replacement uses the `array.map()` method to create a new
