  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"NaN"
```
This would result in different behavior because "NaN" is a string, not a number, and would cause the `Number` method to return `NaN` instead of the expected numeric value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(attempt3[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Boolean` returns a boolean value (true or false) instead of the expected numeric value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a variable that has not been declared or assigned a value, and would cause an error when trying to access the `attempt3[2]` property.

DONE.
