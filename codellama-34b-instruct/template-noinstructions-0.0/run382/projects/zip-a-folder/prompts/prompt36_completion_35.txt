  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end()` would close the output stream immediately, whereas the original code fragment `output` would not close the stream until the archive is finalized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write('')` would write an empty string to the output stream, whereas the original code fragment `output` would not write anything to the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.write('Hello, world!')
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.write('Hello, world!')` would write the string 'Hello, world!' to the output stream, whereas the original code fragment `output` would not write anything to the stream.

DONE.
