  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to determine the base URL for the link, and if it is set to `null`, the link will not be resolved correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to determine the base URL for the link, and if it is set to an empty string, the link will not be resolved correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used to determine the base URL for the link, and if it is set to a different URL, the link will not be resolved correctly.

DONE.
