  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the strict equality operator `===` to check if `tokens` is `null`, while the new code fragment uses the abstract equality operator `==` to check if `tokens` is `null`. The abstract equality operator will return `true` if `tokens` is `null` or `undefined`, while the strict equality operator will only return `true` if `tokens` is `null`.

DONE.
