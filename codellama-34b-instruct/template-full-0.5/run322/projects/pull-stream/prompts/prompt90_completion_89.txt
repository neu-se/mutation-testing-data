  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, so if `test` returns `true`, `!test` will return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is called with two arguments, which may cause it to behave differently than when called with a single argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function is called with `null` as its second argument, which may cause it to behave differently than when called with a non-null value.

DONE.
