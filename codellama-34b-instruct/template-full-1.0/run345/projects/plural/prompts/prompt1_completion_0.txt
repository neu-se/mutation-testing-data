  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).indexOf('y')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns the portion of the string between two indices, while the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Obj.prototype.toString.call(obj).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns the portion of the string between two indices, while the `length` property returns the length of the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Obj.prototype.toString.call(obj).lastIndexOf('y')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns the portion of the string between two indices, while the `lastIndexOf` method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified value in the string.

DONE.
