  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'geese')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for pluralizing "goose" is now incorrect, as it would produce "goose" instead of "geese".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', 'goses')
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for pluralizing "goose" is now incorrect, as it would produce "goses" instead of "geese".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('goose', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the rule for pluralizing "goose" is now incorrect, as it would produce "gooses" instead of "geese".

DONE.
