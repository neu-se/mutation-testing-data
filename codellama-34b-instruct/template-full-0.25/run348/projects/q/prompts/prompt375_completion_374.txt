  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify(newValue)` line to be executed even if an exception was thrown in the `_progressed` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!threw
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify(newValue)` line to be executed only if an exception was not thrown in the `_progressed` function, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
threw || newValue === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.notify(newValue)` line to be executed only if an exception was thrown in the `_progressed` function or if the `newValue` variable is undefined, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
