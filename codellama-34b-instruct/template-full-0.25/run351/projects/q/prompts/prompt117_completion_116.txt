  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `self` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not a valid argument for the `slice` method, and the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method expects a number as its argument, and passing a string would cause the method to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
