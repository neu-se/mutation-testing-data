  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last op from the `ops` array, potentially altering the length of the array and the index of the last op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last op from the `ops` array, potentially altering the length of the array and the index of the last op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the first op from the `ops` array, potentially altering the length of the array and the index of the last op.

DONE.
