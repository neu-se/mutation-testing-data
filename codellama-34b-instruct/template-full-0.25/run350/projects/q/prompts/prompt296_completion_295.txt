  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(y).join
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(y)` is a promise that resolves to `y`, whereas `Q(x)` is a promise that resolves to `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).then()` returns a new promise that resolves to the result of the callback function, which in this case is `value + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).then(function(value) { return value * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(x).then()` returns a new promise that resolves to the result of the callback function, which in this case is `value * 2`.

DONE.
