  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null)` is a function that returns a new function with the `this` context set to `null`, while `array_slice` is a function that returns an array of elements from the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` returns a reversed version of the original array, while `array_slice` returns a slice of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.concat([])` returns a new array that is the concatenation of the original array and an empty array, while `array_slice` returns a slice of the original array.

DONE.
