  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now operating on 3 instead of 2, which would cause the sign to alternate between - and + every 3 iterations instead of every 2 iterations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (tokens[i + 1] || 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| 0` operator is added at the end of the expression, which would cause the result to be 0 if `tokens[i + 1]` is undefined or null, instead of the original code's behavior of using an empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (tokens[i + 1] || tokens[i - 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because
