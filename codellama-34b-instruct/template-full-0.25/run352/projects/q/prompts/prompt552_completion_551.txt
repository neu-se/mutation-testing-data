  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` will create a rejected promise, whereas `when` will create a resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` will create a resolved promise, whereas `when` will create a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([result.value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` will create a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array are resolved, whereas `when` will create a promise that resolves when the first promise in the array is resolved.

DONE.
