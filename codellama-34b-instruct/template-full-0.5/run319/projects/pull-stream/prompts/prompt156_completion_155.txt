  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `value` is equal to `null`. If `value` is equal to `null`, the original code would execute the `if` block, but the new code would execute the `else` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while this new code fragment checks if `value` is equal to `undefined`. If `value` is equal to `undefined`, the original code would execute the `if` block, but the new code would execute the `else` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not equal to `null`, while this new code fragment checks if
