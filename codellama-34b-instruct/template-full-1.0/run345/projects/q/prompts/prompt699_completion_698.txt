  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of skipping the first argument, it would skip the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_length(arguments) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of skipping the first argument, it would skip the last argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the length of the `args` array instead of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
