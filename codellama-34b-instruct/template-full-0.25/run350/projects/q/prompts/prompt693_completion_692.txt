  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only slice the first two arguments, rather than all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments starting from the third one, rather than the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the arguments starting from the second one, but only up to the third one.

DONE.
