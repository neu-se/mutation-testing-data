  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the 'drain' event only when the `_writeStream` is not null, but the replaced code fragment would emit the event unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('drain'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the 'drain' event, but the replaced code fragment would emit an 'error' event with a message of 'drain'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', 'error');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the 'drain' event with no arguments, but the replaced code fragment would emit the event with an argument of 'error'.

DONE.
