Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds 1 to the length of the operation, potentially causing the `retain` method to process one extra character than intended, leading to incorrect delta transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the length of the operation, which may cause the `retain` method to skip processing the last character of the operation, resulting in data loss during transformation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `retain` property of the operation instead of its length, which could lead to incorrect handling of the operation if `retain` is not defined or is not equal to the length of the operation, causing unexpected results in the delta.

DONE.
