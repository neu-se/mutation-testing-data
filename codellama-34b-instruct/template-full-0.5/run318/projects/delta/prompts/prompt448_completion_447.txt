  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because `!op` is the logical NOT operator, which returns `true` if `op` is falsy and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `op` is a variable that is expected to be a truthy value, so `!op` would likely return `false` in most cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op + 1` would add 1 to the value of `op`, which could change the result of the conditional statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `op * 2` would multiply the value of `op` by 2, which could change the result of the conditional statement.

DONE.
