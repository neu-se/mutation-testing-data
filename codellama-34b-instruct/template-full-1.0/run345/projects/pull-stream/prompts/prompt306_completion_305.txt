  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `end`, regardless of whether `ended` was already truthy or not. The original code fragment only sets `ended` to `end` if `ended` was falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to the negation of `end`, regardless of whether `ended` was already truthy or not. The original code fragment only sets `ended` to `end` if `ended` was falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `1`, regardless of whether `ended` was already truthy or not. The original code fragment only sets `ended` to `end` if `ended` was falsy.

DONE.
