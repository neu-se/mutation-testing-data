  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checking for the existence of the `bootstrap` function, while this replacement checks for the opposite condition, i.e., if `bootstrap` is not a function. If `bootstrap` is not a function, the code will enter the `else if` block instead of the `if` block.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checking for the existence of the `bootstrap` function, while this replacement checks for the `undefined` type. If `bootstrap` is undefined, the code will enter the `else` block instead of the `if` block.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checking for the existence of the `bootstrap` function, while this replacement checks for the `string` type. If `bootstrap` is not
