  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called on the iterator, which would advance the iterator to the next element, whereas the original code fragment did not call any methods on the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek()` method returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas the original code fragment did not call any methods on the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new OpIterator(slice.ops).hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext()` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iterator, whereas the original code fragment did not call any methods on the iterator.

DONE.
