  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `nodeback` function to receive a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nodeback` function to receive a different value, and it would also change the order of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the `nodeback` function to receive a different value.

DONE.
