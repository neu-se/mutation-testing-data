  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10 * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(10, places || 0)` returns `100` for `places = 2`, while `Math.PI` is an irrational number, so `10 * Math.PI` would return an approximate value, which would cause the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods to produce different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0.1 + 0.2
```
This would result in different behavior because `0.1 + 0.2` is `0.3`, which is not equal to `10` in the case of `Math.pow(10, places || 0)`. This would cause the `equals` method to return `false`, even if the `actual` and `expected` values are equivalent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in
