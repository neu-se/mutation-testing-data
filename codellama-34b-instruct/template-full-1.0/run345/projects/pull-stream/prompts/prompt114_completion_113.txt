  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err` is passed as the first argument to the callback, while `null` would not pass any argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err` is passed as the first argument to the callback, while `acc` is passed as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && acc
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `err` is passed as the first argument to the callback if it is truthy, while `err && acc` would pass `acc` as the second argument only if `err` is truthy.

DONE.
