  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the server-side logic may handle them differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch"
```
This would result in different behavior because "patch" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the server-side logic may handle them differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the server-side logic may handle them differently.

DONE.
