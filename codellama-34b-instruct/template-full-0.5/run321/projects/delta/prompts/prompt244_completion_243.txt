  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of operations to be deleted, which could affect the result of the `diff()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of operations to be inserted, which could affect the result of the `diff()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of operations to be deleted, which could affect the result of the `diff()` function.

DONE.
