  Sure, here are three options for mutating the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is not being called with the expected argument `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { cb(null) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with a different argument `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is being called with the same argument `true`, but it is being called from a different function.

DONE.
