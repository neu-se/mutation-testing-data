  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `emit` would be called on the `emit` function itself, rather than on the Dirty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` has no `emit` function, so the code would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind()` would return a new function that is bound to `null`, rather than the Dirty object.

DONE.
