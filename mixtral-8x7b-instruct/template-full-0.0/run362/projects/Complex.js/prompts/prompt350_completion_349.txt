 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the result when `a` is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the sign of `a`, which can change the result for negative values of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result, which can change the result for all values of `a`.

DONE.
