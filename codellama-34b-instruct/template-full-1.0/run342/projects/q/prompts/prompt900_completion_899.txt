  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.seleniumWebDriverSolver
```
This would result in different behavior because `seleniumWebDriverSolver` is not a method of the `deferred` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise.upperEdges
```
This would result in different behavior because `upperEdges` is not a property of the `promise` object, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.noeventWPflow
```
This would result in different behavior because `noeventWPflow` is not a property of the `deferred` object, and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
