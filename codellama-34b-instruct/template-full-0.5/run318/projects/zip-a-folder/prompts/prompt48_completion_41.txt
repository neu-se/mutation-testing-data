  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.append
```
This would result in different behavior because `append` is a method that adds a file to the archive, while `finalize` is a method that writes the archive to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.destroy
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy` is a method that destroys the archive, while `finalize` is a method that writes the archive to the output stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe
```
This would result in different behavior because `pipe` is a method that pipes the archive to another stream, while `finalize` is a method that writes the archive to the output stream.

DONE.
