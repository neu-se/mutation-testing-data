Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the error handling from a failure to a success, meaning that if the function call succeeds, it will incorrectly trigger the rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve();
```
This would result in different behavior because it resolves the promise immediately without calling the intended function, which means that the promise will be fulfilled regardless of the outcome of the original function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a different method for handling errors, which may not be compatible with the original promise's rejection mechanism, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
