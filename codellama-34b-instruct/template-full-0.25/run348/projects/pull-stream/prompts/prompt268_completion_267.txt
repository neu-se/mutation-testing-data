  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `(end, stream)`, while the replacement code fragment `null` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `(end, stream)`, while the replacement code fragment `undefined` is not a function and will not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called with the arguments `(end, stream)`, while the replacement code fragment `function() {}` is a different function that will be called with the same arguments.

DONE.
