  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the callback would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the callback would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, which means that the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the callback would not be called.

DONE.
