  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This will cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected, which may cause the test to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This will cause the promise to be notified instead of rejected, which may cause the test to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This will cause the promise to be resolved with a null value, which may cause the test to pass even if the code is not functioning correctly.

DONE.
