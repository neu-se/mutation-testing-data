  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `createWriteStream` function expects a string as its first argument, but `null` is not a string. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `createWriteStream` function expects a string as its first argument, but `undefined` is not a string. This would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dest + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `createWriteStream` function expects a string as its first argument, but `dest + ''` is not a string. This would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
