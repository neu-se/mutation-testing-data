  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be decremented to a negative value, which would cause the `allResolved` function to prematurely resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be incremented to a positive value, which would cause the `allResolved` function to wait indefinitely for the promises to settle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` variable would be set to 1, which would cause the `allResolved` function to resolve the promise immediately after the first promise is settled, even if other promises are still pending.

DONE.
