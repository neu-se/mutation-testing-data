  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (at !== -1) {
  unhandledRejections.splice(at, 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method is only run once, while the splice method is run multiple times, leading to different behavior when the array contains multiple instances of the same element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = unhandledRejections.indexOf(promise);
if (i !== -1) {
  unhandledRejections.splice(i, 1);
  unhandledReasons.splice(i, 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the indexOf method is only run once, while the splice method is run multiple times, leading to different behavior when the array contains multiple instances of the same element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.slice(at, 1);
