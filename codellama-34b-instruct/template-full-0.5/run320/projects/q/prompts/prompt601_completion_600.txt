  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on a different object, which may not have the same implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on a null object, which will throw a `TypeError` exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is called on an undefined object, which will throw a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
