  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `acosh` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `acosh` function to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cbrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cbrt` and `Math.sin` have different outputs for the same input, which would cause the `acosh` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
