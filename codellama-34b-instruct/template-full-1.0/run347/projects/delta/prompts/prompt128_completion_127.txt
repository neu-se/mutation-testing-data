  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to iterate one more time than it should, potentially causing incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start - index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to iterate one fewer time than it should, potentially missing some important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to never terminate, potentially causing an infinite loop.

DONE.
