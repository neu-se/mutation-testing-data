  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult` to be calculated based on the length of the `other` delta, rather than the `this` delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult` to be calculated based on the length of the `this` delta, rather than the `other` delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.min(thisIter.peekLength(), otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult` to be calculated based on the minimum of the lengths of the `this` and `other` deltas, rather than the length of one of the deltas.

DONE.
