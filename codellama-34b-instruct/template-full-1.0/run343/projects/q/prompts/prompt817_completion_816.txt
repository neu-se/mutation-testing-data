  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `fulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will cause an error to be thrown when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "rejected" is a string and will not be treated as a function when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
