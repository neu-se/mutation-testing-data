  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise != null` is a valid check for a promise, but it would not check if the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ndef(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ndef` is not a valid method for checking if a promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise && promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is fulfilled, but it would not check if the promise is rejected.

DONE.
