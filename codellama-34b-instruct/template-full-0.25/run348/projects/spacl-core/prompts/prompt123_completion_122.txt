  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.test(path)` would return a boolean value indicating whether the path matches the regular expression, while `this.regex` would return the regular expression object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.exec(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.exec(path)` would return an array of matches, while `this.regex` would return the regular expression object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.match(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.regex.match(path)` would return an array of matches, while `this.regex` would return the regular expression object itself.

DONE.
