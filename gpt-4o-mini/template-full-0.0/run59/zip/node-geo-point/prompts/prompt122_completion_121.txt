Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the bearing from the origin point (0, 0) instead of the current instance's coordinates, leading to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `point1` variable instead of the current instance, which would not provide the correct reference for calculating the bearing from the current GeoPoint to the target point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly pass only the latitude of the current instance instead of the entire GeoPoint object, which would lead to an error or incorrect calculation in the bearing function.

DONE.
