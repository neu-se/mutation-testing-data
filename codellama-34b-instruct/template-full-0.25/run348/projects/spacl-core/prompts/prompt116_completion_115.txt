  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs) {
  this.verbs[verb] = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over all the properties of the `verbs` object, not just the ones that were passed as arguments to the `deny` method. This would cause the `deny` method to deny all verbs, not just the ones that were passed as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of verbs) {
  this.verbs[verb] = false;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the values of the `verbs` object, not the keys. This would cause the `deny` method to deny all verbs, not just the ones that were passed as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs
