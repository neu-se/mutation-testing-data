  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be one less than the actual number of arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be one more than the actual number of arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of the `arguments` object would be twice the actual number of arguments passed to the function, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
