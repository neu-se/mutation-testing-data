  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(3);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the method to return a different value.

DONE.
