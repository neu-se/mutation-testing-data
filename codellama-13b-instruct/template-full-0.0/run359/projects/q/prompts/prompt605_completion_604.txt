  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `promiseDispatch` method of the `Promise` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `promiseDispatch` property of the `Promise` object. This could result in different behavior if the `promiseDispatch` method is not defined or if it is defined differently in the `Promise` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.promiseDispatch()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `promiseDispatch` method of the `Promise` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the result of calling the `promiseDispatch` method of the `Promise` object. This could result in different behavior if the `promiseDispatch` method returns a different value or if it has different side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self.prom
