  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` parameter would cause the `parse` function to return the parsed URL object, rather than the URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, false);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` parameter would cause the `parse` function to return the URL string, rather than the parsed URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(href, baseUrlStr, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` parameter would cause the `parse` function to return the URL string, rather than the parsed URL object.

DONE.
