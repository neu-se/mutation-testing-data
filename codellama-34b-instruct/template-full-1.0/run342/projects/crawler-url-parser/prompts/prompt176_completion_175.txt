  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.toString()` converts the `url` object into a string, whereas `url` by itself would return the `url` object. If the rest of the code relies on the `url` object, replacing it with a string would likely cause errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.href
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.href` is a property of the `url` object that contains the full URL, whereas `url` by itself would return the URL without the protocol and hostname. If the rest of the code relies on the full URL, replacing `url` with `url.href` would likely cause errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because `url.pathname` is a property of the `url` object that contains the pathname, whereas `url` by itself would return the full
