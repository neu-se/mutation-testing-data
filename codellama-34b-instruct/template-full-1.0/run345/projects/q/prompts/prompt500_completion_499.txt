  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = "no framework"
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return a string instead of the expected function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = 42
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return a number instead of the expected function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a = console.log("hello world")
```
This would result in different behavior because it will log the string "hello world" to the console, but will also return undefined instead of the expected function.

DONE.
