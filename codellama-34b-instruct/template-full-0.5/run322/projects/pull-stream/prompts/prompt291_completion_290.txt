  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `true`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nonUnique` function to always return `null`, regardless of whether the item has been seen before.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nonUnique` function to return a different value for the same input, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
