  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, but this replacement code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, but this replacement code fragment is an arithmetic expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a function call, but this replacement code fragment is a null value.

DONE.
