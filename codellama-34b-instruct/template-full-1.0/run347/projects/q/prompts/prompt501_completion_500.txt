  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because "undefined" is a string, whereas `void 0` is the `undefined` value. This could cause the code to behave differently if the return value of the `when` method is expected to be undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a value, whereas `void 0` is the `undefined` value. This could cause the code to behave differently if the return value of the `when` method is expected to be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because 0 is a number, whereas `void 0` is the `undefined` value. This could cause the code to behave differently if the return value of the `when` method is expected to be undefined.

DONE.
