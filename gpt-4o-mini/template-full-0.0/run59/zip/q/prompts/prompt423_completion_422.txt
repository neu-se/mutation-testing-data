Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly return `true` for fulfilled promises, as it checks for the "pending" state instead of the "fulfilled" state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it assumes that `object` has a direct `state` property, which it does not, leading to a potential runtime error or always returning `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().status === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly references a non-existent `status` property instead of the correct `state` property, causing the check to fail for fulfilled promises.

DONE.
