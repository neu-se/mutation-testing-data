  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be thrown instead of the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error would be notified instead of the original error.

DONE.
