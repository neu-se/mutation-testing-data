  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the string "fulfilled" instead of the object "promise".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the string "rejected" instead of the object "promise".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be pending instead of resolved or rejected.

DONE.
