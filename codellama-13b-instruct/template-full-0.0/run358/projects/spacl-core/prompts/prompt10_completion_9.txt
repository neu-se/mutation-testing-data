  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow paths with multiple consecutive wildcards, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/g) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow paths with multiple consecutive wildcards, and it would also allow paths with multiple consecutive wildcards that are not at the beginning or end of the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/g) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow paths with multiple consecutive wildcards, and it would also allow paths with multiple consecutive wildcards that are not at the beginning or end of the path.

DONE.
