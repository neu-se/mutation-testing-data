  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.hasOwnProperty` returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property, rather than returning the value of the property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.getter
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.getter` is a property that returns a function that can be called to retrieve the value of the property, rather than returning the value of the property directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.valueOf
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.valueOf` is a function that returns the primitive value of the object, rather than returning the object itself.

DONE.
