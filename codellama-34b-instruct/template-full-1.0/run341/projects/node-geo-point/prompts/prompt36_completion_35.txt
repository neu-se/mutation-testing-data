  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `sin` and `cos` are inverse trigonometric functions, and they give different values for the same angle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(1+cos(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the result of the `cos` function, which would change the value and potentially the behavior of the algorithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(cos(x)-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts 1 from the result of the `cos` function, which would change the value and potentially the behavior of the algorithm.

DONE.
