  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the replaced code converts the path to lowercase before passing it to the `matches` method. This could cause the `matches` method to return a different result, potentially leading to a false positive or false negative in the test.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the replaced code appends the string 'foo' to the path before passing it to the `matches` method. This could cause the `matches` method to return a different result, potentially leading to a false positive or false negative in the test.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `path` variable as-is, while the replaced code extracts
