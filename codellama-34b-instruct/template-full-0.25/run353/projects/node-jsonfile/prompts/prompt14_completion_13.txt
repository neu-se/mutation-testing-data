  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shouldThrow` variable is not being checked for equality with `true`, but rather it is being checked for truthiness. This means that if `shouldThrow` is any value other than `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, or an empty string, the code will behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shouldThrow` variable is not being checked for inequality with `false`, but rather it is being checked for truthiness. This means that if `shouldThrow` is any value other than `false`, `null`, `undefined`, `0`, or an empty string, the code will behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shouldThrow` variable is not being negated, but rather it is being checked for truthiness. This means that if
