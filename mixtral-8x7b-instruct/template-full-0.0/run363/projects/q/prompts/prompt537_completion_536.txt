 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would not pass the `value` to the `fulfilled` callback as an array, but instead pass `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would pass a hard-coded value `42` to the `fulfilled` callback instead of the actual resolved value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` function would pass the value of the `this` keyword to the `fulfilled` callback instead of the resolved value of the promise.

DONE.
