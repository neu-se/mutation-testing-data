  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsey value and `void 0` is truthy. If the callback function passed to `when` returns `null`, the `then` method will interpret it as a rejection and execute the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a value and `void 0` is a value (of type `undefined`). If the callback function passed to `when` returns `undefined`, the `then` method will interpret it as a rejection and execute the rejection handler instead of the fulfillment handler.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that represents a non-numeric result. If the callback function passed to `when` returns `NaN`, the `then` method will interpret it as a rejection
