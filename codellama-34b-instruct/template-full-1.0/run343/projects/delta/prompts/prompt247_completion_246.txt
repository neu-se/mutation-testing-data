  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.length` is different from `opLength`, which is a variable in the `diffResult` loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, and adding 1 to it would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a string, and `op.insert.length` is a different value than `op.insert`.

DONE.
