  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Number` function to convert the `bearing` variable to a number, but this replacement code fragment adds 180 to the `bearing` variable before converting it to a number. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Number` function to convert the `bearing` variable to a number, but this replacement code fragment multiplies the `bearing` variable by 2 before converting it to a number. This would cause the `calculateDestination` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Number` function
