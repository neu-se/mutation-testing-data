  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would cause a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an arrow function with an empty body would not have the same behavior as the original function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would not have the same behavior as the original function.

DONE.
