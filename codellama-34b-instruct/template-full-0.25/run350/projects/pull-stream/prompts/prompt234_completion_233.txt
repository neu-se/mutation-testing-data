  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator changes the value of `data`, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator changes the value of `data`, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` is a different value than `data`, which could cause the `test` function to return a different result.

DONE.
