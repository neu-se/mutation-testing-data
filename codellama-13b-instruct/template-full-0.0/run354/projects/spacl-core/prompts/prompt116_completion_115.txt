  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.map(v => v.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` method is used to convert the verbs to uppercase, which would affect the comparison with the verbs in the `verbs` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.filter(v => v !== 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method is used to remove the `GET` verb from the list of verbs, which would affect the comparison with the verbs in the `verbs` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.reduce((acc, v) => acc + v, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reduce` method is used to concatenate the verbs into a single string, which would affect the comparison with the verbs in the `verbs` object.

DONE.
