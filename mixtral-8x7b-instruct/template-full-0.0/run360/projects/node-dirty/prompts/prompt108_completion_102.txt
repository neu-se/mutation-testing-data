 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the first character of the buffer instead of the length. If the first character is not the start of a valid JSON object, it would trigger an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the size of the `_data` object instead of the length of the `buffer`. If there is a corrupted row at the end of the database, it would not trigger an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'corrupted'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always triggers an error, even if there is no corrupted row at the end of the database. This would cause the code to behave differently and potentially mask other issues.

DONE.
