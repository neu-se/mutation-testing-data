  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `result` object has a property with the name of the current `country`, and if that property is undefined. If the property is undefined, it means that the `result` object does not have a property with that name, and the code will execute the `Object.assign()` method to create a new property with the name of the current `country` and initialize it with an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== undefined
```
This code fragment checks if the `result` object has a property with the name of the current `country`, and if that property is not undefined. If the property is not undefined, it means that the `result` object already has a property with that name, and the code will not execute the `Object.assign()` method to create a new property with the name of the current `country`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === null
