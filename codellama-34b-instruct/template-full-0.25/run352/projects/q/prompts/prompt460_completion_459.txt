  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `at` is not equal to -1, while this replacement checks if `at` is equal to -1. This would cause the `if` statement to be executed even if `at` is not -1, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `at` is not equal to -1, while this replacement checks if `at` is greater than -1. This would cause the `if` statement to be executed even if `at` is -1, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `at` is not equal to -1, while this replacement checks if `at` is less than -1. This would cause the `if`
