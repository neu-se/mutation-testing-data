  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any number of characters, whereas the original match only matches non-empty segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.replace(/\*/, "**")
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces all occurrences of "*" with "**", which may not be intended if the intention was to match any number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\*/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any number of characters, whereas the original match only matches non-empty segments.

DONE.
