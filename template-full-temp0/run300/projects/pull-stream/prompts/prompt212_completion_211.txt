  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call, which would cause the function to be executed immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call using the `call()` method, which would cause the function to be executed with a different `this` context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a function, while the new code fragment is a function call using the `apply()` method, which would cause the function to be executed with a different `this` context and a different set of arguments.

DONE.
