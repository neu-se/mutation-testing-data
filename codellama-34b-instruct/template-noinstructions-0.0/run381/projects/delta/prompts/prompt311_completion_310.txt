  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the mutated code increments it by 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the mutated code decrements it by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code increments `i` by 1, while the mutated code increments it by 2.

DONE.
