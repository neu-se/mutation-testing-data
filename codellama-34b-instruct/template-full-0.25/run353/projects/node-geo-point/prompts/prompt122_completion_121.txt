  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would receive a null value as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would receive an undefined value as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateBearing` method would receive the longitude value as the first argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected result.

DONE.
