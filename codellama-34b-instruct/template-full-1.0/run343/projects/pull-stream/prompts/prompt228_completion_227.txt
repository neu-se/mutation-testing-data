  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `data` object has a `name` property that is `undefined`, which may not be the intended behavior of the `filter` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length % 2 === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `data` object has a `length` property that is even, which may not be the intended behavior of the `filter` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof data !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `data` variable is not an object, which may not be the intended behavior of the `filter` function.

DONE.
