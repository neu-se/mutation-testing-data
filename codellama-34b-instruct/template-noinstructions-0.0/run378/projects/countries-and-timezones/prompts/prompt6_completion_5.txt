  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezonesMap` function would return an empty object, instead of an object with the expected structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezonesMap` function would return an object with an empty `current` and `all` properties, instead of an object with the expected structure.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ current: [], all: [] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezonesMap` function would return an object with an empty `current` and `all` properties, instead of an object with the expected structure.

DONE.
