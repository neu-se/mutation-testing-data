  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof lastOp !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is not an object. This could cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is null or undefined. This could cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is null or undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `lastOp` is an object, while this replacement checks if it is an instance of the `Object` constructor. This could cause the code to behave differently when `lastOp` is an instance of a different constructor.

DONE.
