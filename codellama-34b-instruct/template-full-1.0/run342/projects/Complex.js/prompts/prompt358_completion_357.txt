  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)` returns the sum of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment `cosh(a) + a` returns the sum of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and the literal value `a`, which may have different semantics in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)` returns the sum of the hyperbolic cosine of `a` and the cosine of `b`, while the new code fragment `Math.sin(b)` returns the sine of `b`, which may have different semantics in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
