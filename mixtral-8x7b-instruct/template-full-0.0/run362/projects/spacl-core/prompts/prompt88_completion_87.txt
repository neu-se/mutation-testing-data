 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra value (the policy object itself) to the Map, causing issues when querying for policies by name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name.toUpperCase(), policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the policy name to uppercase, causing issues when querying for policies by name, as the query would be case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, () => policy]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a function that returns the policy instead of the policy itself, causing issues when querying for policies by name, as the returned function would not have the `query` and `matches` methods.

DONE.
