  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is not called, which would cause the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is called with `undefined` as the `this` value, which could cause an error if the function relies on `this` being a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bound` function is called with a different function as the `this` value, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
