 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the object to a string using the `toString()` method, rather than using `JSON.stringify()` which converts the object to a JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
```
This would result in different behavior because it performs a double serialization of the object, which can cause loss of information such as function properties, and is generally not equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
util.inspect(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `util.inspect()` method to convert the object to a string, which can produce a different output than `JSON.stringify()`.

DONE.
