  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would return `null` if the `name` property is undefined, rather than returning the `id` property as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would return `null` if the `name` property is null, rather than returning the `id` property as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function would return `null` if the `name` property is an empty string, rather than returning the `id` property as in the original code.

DONE.
