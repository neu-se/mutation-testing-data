  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
lastOp === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `lastOp` is an object, and `null` is a primitive value. In the original code, `lastOp` is checked to be an object using `typeof lastOp === 'object'`, but this check would fail if `lastOp` is `null`.

DONE.
