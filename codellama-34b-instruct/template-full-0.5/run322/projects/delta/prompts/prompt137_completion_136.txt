  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'string' &&
      firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof firstOther.retain` would return "string" instead of "number", which would cause the while loop to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.attributes != null` would cause the while loop to be skipped if `firstOther.attributes` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther != null &&
      typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' &&
      firstOther.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `firstOther.attributes.length > 0` would cause the while loop to be skipped if `first
