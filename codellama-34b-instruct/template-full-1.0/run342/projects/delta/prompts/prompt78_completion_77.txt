  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'string' && typeof lastOp.delete === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are both numbers, while this code checks if they are both strings. This change would likely cause the code to produce an error, as `typeof newOp.delete` and `typeof lastOp.delete` are almost always guaranteed to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete !== 'number' && typeof lastOp.delete !== 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are both numbers, while this code checks if they are not both numbers. This change would likely cause the code to behave as if there were no delete operations, as `typeof newOp.delete` and `typeof lastOp.delete` are almost always guaranteed to be different.
