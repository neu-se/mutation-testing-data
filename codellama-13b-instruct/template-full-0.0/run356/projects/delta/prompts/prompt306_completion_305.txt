  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate one more time than the original code, potentially causing the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect `index` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate one fewer time than the original code, potentially causing the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect `index` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate twice as many times as the original code, potentially causing the `predicate` function to be called with an incorrect `index` value.

DONE.
