  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element in the slice, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include an extra element in the slice, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, potentially causing the `invert` method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
