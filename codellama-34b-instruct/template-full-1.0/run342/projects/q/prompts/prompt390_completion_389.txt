  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    throw error;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rejected` function simply returns the rejection reason, while this new function throws an error, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    return "ERROR";
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rejected` function returns the rejection reason, while this new function returns a hard-coded string "ERROR", which would cause the promise to resolve with a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) {
    return Q.reject(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `rejected` function simply returns the rejection reason, while this new function returns a rejected promise with the same rejection reason, which would cause the promise to be rejected with the same reason, essentially making the
