  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment throws an exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a resolved promise with the exception as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(new Error(exception));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a rejected promise with a new error object that wraps the original exception.

DONE.
