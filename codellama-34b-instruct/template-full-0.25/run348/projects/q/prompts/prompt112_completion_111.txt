  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the callback to be called with an incorrect argument, potentially causing it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the callback to be called with an incorrect argument, potentially causing it to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call(thisp, value, index, self) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the callback to be called with an incorrect argument, potentially causing it to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
