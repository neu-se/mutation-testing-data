  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `isInfinite` method, causing the `toString` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` method checks if the number is finite, whereas the `isInfinite` method checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method checks if the number is not a number, whereas the `isInfinite` method checks if the number is infinite.

DONE.
