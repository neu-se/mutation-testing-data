  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the negation of both conditions, while this code only checks for the negation of the first condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 'object' || b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the negation of both conditions, while this code only checks for the negation of the second condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b || b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both conditions, while this code only checks for the second condition.

DONE.
