Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the current complex number (represented by `this`) is zero instead of checking if the complex number `z` is zero, potentially leading to incorrect results when `this` is not zero but `z` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part of the complex number `z` is zero instead of checking if `z` itself is zero, which could lead to incorrect handling of cases where the imaginary part is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the check, meaning the code would proceed as if `z` is not zero when it actually is, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or results in the power function.

DONE.
