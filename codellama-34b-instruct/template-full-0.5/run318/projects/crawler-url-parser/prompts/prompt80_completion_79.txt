  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href", "http://www.example.com");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always set the href attribute of the link to "http://www.example.com", regardless of its original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).removeAttr("href");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would remove the href attribute from the link, causing it to not be clickable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr("href", "javascript:void(0)");
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would set the href attribute of the link to "javascript:void(0)", which would prevent the link from being followed.

DONE.
