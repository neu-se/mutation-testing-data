  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(promises);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.resolve(promises)` only when `pendingCount` is 0, which means that all promises have been resolved. However, the replaced code fragment uses `deferred.resolve(promises)` regardless of the value of `pendingCount`, which means that the promise will be resolved even if some promises are still pending.
