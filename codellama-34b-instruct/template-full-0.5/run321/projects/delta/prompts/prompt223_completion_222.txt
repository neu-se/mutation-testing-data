  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would receive the same string as both arguments, causing it to return an empty delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would receive a third string that is not present in the original code, causing it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would receive a modified version of the second string, causing it to return a different delta.

DONE.
