  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the truthiness of the expression, so `!resolvedPromise` would be `true` if `resolvedPromise` is `false`, and `false` if `resolvedPromise` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf()` is a method that returns the primitive value of the object, which is not necessarily the same as the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a method that dispatches the promise, which is not necessarily the same as the resolved promise itself.

DONE.
