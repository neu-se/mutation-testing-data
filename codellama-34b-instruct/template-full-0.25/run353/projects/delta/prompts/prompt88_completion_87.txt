  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'number' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this new code fragment checks if both are numbers. This would cause the code to behave differently for cases where `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are not both numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.insert === 'object' &&
          typeof lastOp.insert === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if both `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are strings, while this new code fragment checks if both are objects. This would cause the code to behave differently for cases where `newOp.insert` and `lastOp.insert` are not both objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp
