  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` creates a rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and work with promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` creates a deferred object, which is used to create a promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and work with promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` is a method that takes a promise and returns a new promise that is fulfilled with the same value as the original promise, whereas `Q` is a promise library that provides a way to create and work with promises.

DONE.
