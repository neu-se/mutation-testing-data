  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would return a new policy with a null name, which would cause the `matches` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would return a new policy with an undefined name, which would cause the `matches` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone` method would return a new policy with a name that is not a string, which would cause the `matches` method to throw an error.

DONE.
