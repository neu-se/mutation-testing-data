  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different sign in the expression for `r`. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r - b)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but with a different variable in the expression for `r`. This could potentially cause the `sqrt` method to return incorrect results in certain cases.

DONE.
