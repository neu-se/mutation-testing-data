  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.resolve` returns the absolute path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.resolve` returns the absolute path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.join(__dirname, options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.join` returns the concatenation of multiple path components, while `path.resolve` returns the absolute path.

DONE.
