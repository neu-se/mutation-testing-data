  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to remove the wrong rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the
