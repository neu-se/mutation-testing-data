  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+:(?:\/|\/[^/]+)|:\/|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a backslash (`\`) followed by a forward slash (`/`) as a valid capture, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+:(?:\/|\/[^/]+)|:\/[/]|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a forward slash (`/`) followed by a backslash (`\`) as a valid capture, while the original code fragment would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+:(?:\/|\/[^/]+)|:\/+|:$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more forward slashes (`/`) followed by a backslash (`\`) as a valid capture, while the original code fragment would only match a single forward slash.
