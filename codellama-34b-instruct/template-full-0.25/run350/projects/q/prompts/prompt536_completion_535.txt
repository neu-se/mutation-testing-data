  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` will immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and would create a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` will immediately resolve the promise, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and would create a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` will create a new deferred object, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and would create a new promise.

DONE.
