 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `arguments` object directly. This could lead to issues if the code relies on the mutability of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
