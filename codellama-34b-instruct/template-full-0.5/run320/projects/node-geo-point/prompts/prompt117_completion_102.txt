  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `latitude` and `longitude` properties of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use the coordinates `(0, 0)` instead of the current coordinates to calculate the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
GeoPoint.fromLatLngArray([0, 0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method would use the coordinates `(0, 0)` instead of the current coordinates to calculate the destination point, and would also create a new `GeoPoint` object instead of using the current one.

DONE.
