 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned object in the `onProgress` function would be `null` instead of an object with `index` and `value` properties. This could cause issues for any code expecting a specific structure in the progress updates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{index: 'string', value: progress}
