  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the line number, which could cause the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the line number, which could cause the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the line number, which could cause the stack trace to point to a different line.

DONE.
