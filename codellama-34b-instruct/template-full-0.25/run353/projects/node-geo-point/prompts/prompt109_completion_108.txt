  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the tile size to be doubled, which would result in a different tile coordinate system.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the tile size to be halved, which would result in a different tile coordinate system.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(2, zoom * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the tile size to be quadrupled, which would result in a different tile coordinate system.

DONE.
