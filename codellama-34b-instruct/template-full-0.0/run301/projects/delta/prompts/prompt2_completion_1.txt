  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code checks if `b` is null. If `b` is null, the original code would still consider it an object, while this new code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code checks if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class. If `b` is an instance of a subclass of `Object`, the original code would still consider it an object, while this new code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) !== '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this new code checks if the string representation of `b`
