  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, and it would also change the order of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i++], array[i++]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, and it would also change the order of the arguments.

DONE.
