  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also match `null` and `undefined` values, which are not matched by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude `null` values, which are included by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the prototype chain for the property, which is not checked by the original code.

DONE.
