  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' &&
            thisData !== null &&
            typeof otherData === 'object' &&
            otherData !== null &&
            thisData.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `thisData.length > 0` would cause the code to only execute when `thisData` is a non-empty object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData === 'object' &&
            thisData !== null &&
            typeof otherData === 'object' &&
            otherData !== null &&
            thisData.length === otherData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `thisData.length === otherData.length` would cause the code to only execute when `thisData` and `otherData` have the same length, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisData ===
