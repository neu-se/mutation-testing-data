Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this instanceof Array
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is an instance of `Array`, which would incorrectly allow an array to be treated as a `Complex` object, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is strictly equal to `null`, which would incorrectly allow the creation of a `Complex` object when `this` is `null`, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof this === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `this` is a string, which would incorrectly allow a string to be treated as a `Complex` object, potentially causing issues in the parsing logic that follows.

DONE.
