Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the first value of the object `b` instead of the first key, which could lead to mismatches in the expected embed types, causing the error message to be misleading or incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from checking if the embed types are not equal to checking if they are equal, which would cause the error to be thrown incorrectly when they actually match.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b).length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `b` has no keys at all, which would incorrectly throw an error if `b` is an empty object, even if `a` has a valid embed type.

DONE.
