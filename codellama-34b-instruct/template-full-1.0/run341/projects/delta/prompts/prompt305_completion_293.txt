  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```line.length < 0```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the condition, making the predicate function always return `true` instead of only if the line is non-empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```line.length = 0```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the length of the line to 0 instead of checking if it's non-empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```!line.length```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the line is empty instead of non-empty.

DONE.
