  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, so the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is the same, but the code that handles the event would not be triggered because the event is not emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, so the code that handles the event would not be triggered.

DONE.
