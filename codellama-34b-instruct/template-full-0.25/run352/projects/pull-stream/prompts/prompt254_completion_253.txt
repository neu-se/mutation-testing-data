  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === true) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an error object, while this code checks for the presence of a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === 'true') nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an error object, while this code checks for the presence of a string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (err === 1) nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an error object, while this code checks for the presence of a number value.

DONE.
