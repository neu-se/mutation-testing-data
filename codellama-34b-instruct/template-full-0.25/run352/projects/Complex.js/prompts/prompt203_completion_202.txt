  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function using the `Math.exp` method, which is different from the original code that uses the `Math.pow` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + i*b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the complex number `a + i*b`, which is different from the original code that calculates the exponential function and then subtracts 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp(a + i*b) - a - i*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the exponential function using the `Math.exp` method and then subtract the original complex number `a + i*b`, which is different from the original code that calculates the exponential function and then subtracts 1.

DONE.
