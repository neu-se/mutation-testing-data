  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Alice
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a different variable, "Alice", rather than the intended variable "cosh".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "tan" function, rather than the intended "cosh" function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the "sqrt" function, rather than the intended "cosh" function.

DONE.
