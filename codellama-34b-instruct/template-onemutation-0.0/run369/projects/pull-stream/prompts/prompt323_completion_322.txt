  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a function reference, while the new code fragment `onEnd()` is a function call. The function call would execute the `onEnd` function immediately, whereas the function reference would only execute the function when it is called later in the code.

DONE.
