Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise or value to be delayed, but replacing it with `null` would cause the delay function to operate on a non-existent value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` instead of the original `object` would mean that the delay function is called with an undefined value, which may not be handled correctly and could lead to a rejection or an immediate resolution without any delay.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject(new Error("Test Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of delaying a valid promise or value, it would immediately return a rejected promise with an error, bypassing the intended delay functionality altogether.

DONE.
