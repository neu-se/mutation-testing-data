  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return an empty stream instead of a stream that ends immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a stream that ends immediately instead of a stream that contains the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a stream that ends immediately instead of a stream that contains the value `undefined`.

DONE.
