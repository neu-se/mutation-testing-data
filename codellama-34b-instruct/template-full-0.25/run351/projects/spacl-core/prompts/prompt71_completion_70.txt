  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to lowercase, which could potentially cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `verb` string to uppercase, which could potentially cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split`, `reverse`, and `join` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `verb` string, which could potentially cause the `query` method to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
