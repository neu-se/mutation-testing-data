  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(a)` is not the same as `cosh(a)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is not the same as `1/0` which is infinity in complex numbers space.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Complex(a,0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Complex variable with a real part of `a` and an imaginary part of `0`, which is not the same as `new Complex(a, b)`.

DONE.
