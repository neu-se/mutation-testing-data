  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the `ref` array is being used instead of the first, which is what the original code fragment uses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `ref` array is being incremented by 1 before being used, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref` array is being set to `null` after being used, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
