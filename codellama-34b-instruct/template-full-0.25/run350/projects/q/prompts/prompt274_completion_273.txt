  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error instanceof Error)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if `error` is an instance of the `Error` class, which is not always the case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.name === "Error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of an `Error` object is not always set to "Error".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error.message.includes("Error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `message` property of an `Error` object may not contain the string "Error".

DONE.
