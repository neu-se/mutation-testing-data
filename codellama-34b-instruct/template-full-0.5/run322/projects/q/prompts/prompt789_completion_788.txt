  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(null, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(noop, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value instead of being rejected with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then(noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with a value instead of being rejected with an error.

DONE.
