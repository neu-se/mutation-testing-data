  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + 1
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to start from the next character instead of the current one, which may result in a different substring being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset - 1
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to start from the previous character instead of the current one, which may result in a different substring being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This change will cause the `substr` method to start from the end of the string instead of the beginning, which may result in a different substring being returned.

DONE.
