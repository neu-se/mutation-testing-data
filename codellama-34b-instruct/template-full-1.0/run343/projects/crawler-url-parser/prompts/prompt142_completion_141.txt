  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
jective = "sdsdsdsdsdsd"
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the regular expression that is used to check for a default file with a new string, which does not match the regular expression and would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]{5}/$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the regular expression that is used to check for a default file to match any character, instead of only allowing letters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '/+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new character to the regular expression that is used to check for a default file, which would result in a different match.

DONE.
