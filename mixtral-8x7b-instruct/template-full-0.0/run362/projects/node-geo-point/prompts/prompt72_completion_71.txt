 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / radius
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, potentially causing a division by zero error if `radius` is 0 or a negative number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.pow(distance, 1 / radius)
```
This would result in different behavior because it raises `distance` to the power of `1 / radius` instead of dividing `distance` by `radius`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
radius === 0 ? Infinity : distance / radius
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns `Infinity` when `radius` is 0, instead of throwing an error.

DONE.
