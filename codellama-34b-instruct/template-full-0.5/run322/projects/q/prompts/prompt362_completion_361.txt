  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is fulfilled, the `_rejected` function would be called with the fulfillment value, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is fulfilled, the `_progressed` function would be called with the fulfillment value, which would cause the promise to be notified of progress instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(reject(value))
```
This would result in different behavior because when the promise is fulfilled, the `_fulfilled` function would be called with the result of `reject(value)`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
