Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.match` returns an array containing the matched strings if the string matches the regular expression, whereas `value.split` splits the string into an array of substrings based on the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `value.replace` replaces the occurrences of the regular expression in the string with a replacement string, whereas `value.split` splits the string into an array of substrings based on the regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(str) { return [str]; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function returns an array containing the original string, whereas `value.split` splits the string into an array of substrings based on the regular expression, potentially resulting in multiple substrings.

DONE.
