  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotEqual
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function compares two values for equality, while the `isNotEqual` function compares two values for inequality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNot
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function compares two values for equality, while the `isNot` function checks whether a value is not a certain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNotIdentical
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isEqual` function compares two values for equality, while the `isNotIdentical` function checks whether two values are not identical.

DONE.
