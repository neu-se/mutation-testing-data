  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function and was called as a method, but this code fragment calls it as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function and was called with an arguments object as an argument, but this code fragment uses the build-in `slice` method on the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is `undefined`, and it will replace the `array_slice(arguments)` code fragment with `undefined`.

DONE.
