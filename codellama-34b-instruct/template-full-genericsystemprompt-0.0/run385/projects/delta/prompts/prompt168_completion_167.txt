  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to move forward, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` iterator to move forward by `length` operations, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the resulting `Delta`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to move forward by `length` operations, potentially skipping over operations that should be included in the resulting `Delta`.

DONE.
