  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input unchanged, while this new fragment appends an 's' to the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input unchanged, while this new fragment removes the last character of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input unchanged, while this new fragment uppercases the input.

DONE.
