  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"key" + "value"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the strings "key" and "value" instead of returning the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of the key instead of returning the value associated with the key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of the key instead of the value associated with the key.

DONE.
