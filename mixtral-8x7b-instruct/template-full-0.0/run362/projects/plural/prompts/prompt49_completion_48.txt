 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule.bind(null, /[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `Function.bind` to partially apply the first argument of `addRule`, creating a function that ignores the first argument (the `match` parameter) when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `addRule` call in an anonymous function, which prevents the rule from being added to the `rules` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, 'function(w) { return w + 'es' }')
