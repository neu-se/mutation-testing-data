  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator used to calculate the inverse cosecant is different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the variable used to calculate the inverse cosecant is negated from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable used to calculate the inverse cosecant is different from the original code.

DONE.
