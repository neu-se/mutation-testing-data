  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `value` is always defined, whereas in the mutated code, `value` can be `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `value` is never `null`, whereas in the mutated code, `value` can be `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `value` is never 0, whereas in the mutated code, `value` can be 0.

DONE.
