  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript, whereas `null` is a null object reference. In this case, if the `test` function returns `undefined`, the `ended` variable would be set to `undefined`, which is a falsy value, and would not trigger the `last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)` branch, whereas the `null` value would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, data
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a truthy value in JavaScript, whereas `null` is a falsy value. In this case, if the `test` function returns `true`, the `ended` variable would be set to `true`, which would trigger the `last ? terminate(cb) : cb(ended)` branch, whereas the `null` value would not.
