  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text + "extra"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operator `+` is used instead of the original concatenation operator `.`, which would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method is called on the `text` variable, which would convert the text to uppercase, whereas the original code does not modify the text in any way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is accessed on the `text` variable, which would return the length of the text, whereas the original code does not use the length of the text in any way.

DONE.
