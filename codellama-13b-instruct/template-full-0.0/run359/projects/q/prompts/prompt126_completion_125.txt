  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for any property of `undefined`, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return an empty array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for any property of `null`, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `true` for any property of an empty object, which would cause the `object_keys` function to return an empty array.

DONE.
