  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) * cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be called on `a` multiplied by `a`, which would produce different results than calling `cosh` on `a` alone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sqrt(cosh(a))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `sqrt` function to be called on `cosh(a)`, which would produce different results than calling `sqrt` on the result of `cosh(a)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) - cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `cosh` function to be called on `a` and then subtract the result from itself, which would produce different results than calling `cosh` on `a` alone.

DONE.
