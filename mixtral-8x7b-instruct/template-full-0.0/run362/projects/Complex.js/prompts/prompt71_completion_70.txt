 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*e[+-]?[0-9]+|[0-9]+\.?[0-9]*|\.[0-9]+|./g
```
This would result in different behavior because the dot character "." is now escaped, changing the regex behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|[a-z]
```
This would result in different behavior because the character class [a-z] is added, which can match any lowercase letter, potentially causing the regex to match unexpected inputs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
\d+\.?\d*e[+-]?\d+|\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+|[0-9]
```
This would result in different behavior
