 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice', 'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule adds an 's' to the end of 'die' to form 'dies', but the buggy rule does not change 'dice'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'die', 'di'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule adds an 's' to the end of 'die' to form 'dies', but the buggy rule replaces 'die' with 'di'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'dice', 'di'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule does not change 'dice', but the buggy rule replaces 'dice' with 'di'.

DONE.
