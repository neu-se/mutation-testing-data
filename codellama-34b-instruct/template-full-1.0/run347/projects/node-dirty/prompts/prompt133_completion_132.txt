  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[.queue.delete];
```
This would result in different behavior because "this" refers to the global object, not the class instance and ".queue.delete" is not a valid property accessor.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because "clear()" clears the entire queue, not just a single entry.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because "shift()" retrieves the first element of an array, but "shift" is a function that deletes and returns the first element of an array.
DONE.
