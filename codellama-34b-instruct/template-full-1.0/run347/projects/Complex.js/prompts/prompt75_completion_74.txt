  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, and the first element of the `tokens` array would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from -1 and would iterate over the `tokens` array in reverse order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element of the `tokens` array instead of the first, and would iterate in reverse order.

DONE.
