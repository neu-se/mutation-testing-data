Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because using the sine function instead of cosine would change the mathematical relationship being calculated, leading to incorrect results for the complex number conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because using the tangent function would alter the angle calculation significantly, resulting in a completely different output for the complex number representation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because adding 1 to the angle before applying the cosine function would shift the output, leading to incorrect calculations for the real part of the complex number.

DONE.
