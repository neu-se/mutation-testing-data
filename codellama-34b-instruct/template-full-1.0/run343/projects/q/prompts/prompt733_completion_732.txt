  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always reject the promise, even if the promises were resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always resolve the promise with `undefined`, even if the promises were rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always resolve the promise with the array of promises, even if the promises were resolved or rejected.

DONE.
