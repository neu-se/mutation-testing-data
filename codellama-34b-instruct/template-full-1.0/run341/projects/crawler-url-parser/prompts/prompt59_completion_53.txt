  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would think that the base URL is invalid, even if it is actually a valid URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would think that the base URL is missing, even if it is actually provided as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"https://example.com/path/to/resource"
```
This would result in different behavior because the URL parsing function would think that the base URL is a different URL than the one provided as an argument, even if it is actually the same URL.

DONE.
