  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the write stream was destroyed before emitting the `write_close` event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(buf => buf.toString());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not passing a callback to the `end` method, but the new code is passing a callback that converts the buffer to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(buf => buf.toString().split('\n'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not performing any string manipulation, but the new code is splitting the string into an array of lines.

DONE.
