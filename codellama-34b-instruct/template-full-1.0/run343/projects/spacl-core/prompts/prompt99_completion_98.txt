  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.isQuery
```
This would result in different behavior because `isQuery` is a method that checks if a policy is a query, whereas `query` is a method that performs a query on a policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query("invalid")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `query` method is called with an invalid argument, which would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because an additional argument `true` is passed to the `query` method, which would cause it to return a different result.

DONE.
