Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
";"
```
This would result in different behavior because using a semicolon would terminate the statement, causing the stack trace to be split incorrectly, potentially leading to an invalid or incomplete stack trace.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because using a carriage return and line feed combination may alter how the stack trace is formatted, potentially affecting the readability and structure of the stack trace output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the newline character with a space would concatenate all lines into a single line, making it impossible to distinguish between different stack trace entries, thus losing critical debugging information.

DONE.
