  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.emit` is a function, and the original code checks if `process` is an object and has an `emit` property that is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process` is an object, and this code checks if it is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `process.emit` is a function, and this code checks if it is not a function.

DONE.
