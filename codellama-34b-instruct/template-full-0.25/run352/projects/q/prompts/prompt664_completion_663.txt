  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from index 2, whereas the original code slices it starting from index 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from index 0, whereas the original code slices it starting from index 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from index 1 and ending at index 2, whereas the original code slices it starting from index 1 and ending at the end of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
