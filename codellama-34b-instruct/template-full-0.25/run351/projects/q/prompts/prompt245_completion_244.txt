  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter--;
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter--` would decrement the counter by 1, whereas `longStackCounter++` would increment it by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter + 1` would add 1 to the counter, whereas `longStackCounter++` would increment it by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.stackCounter = longStackCounter - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `longStackCounter - 1` would subtract 1 from the counter, whereas `longStackCounter++` would increment it by 1.

DONE.
