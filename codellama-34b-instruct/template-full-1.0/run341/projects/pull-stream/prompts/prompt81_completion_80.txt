  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err instanceof Error
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is not guaranteed to be an instance of the `Error` class, and the code expects it to be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof err !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code expects `err` to be a function, but this check allows for any non-function value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.constructor !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `err.constructor` is not guaranteed to be the `Function` constructor, and the code expects it to be.

DONE.
