  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is a different function than `trackRejection`, and it would not track the rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `trackRejection` function with the same arguments as the original code, but it would not have the same effect because it is not in the same context as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason); untrackRejection(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call `trackRejection` and then immediately call `untrackRejection`, which would have the opposite effect of tracking the rejection.

DONE.
