  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` object would be set to `null` instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy name, path, and verb combination.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy` object would be set to `undefined` instead of the actual policy object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy name, path, and verb combination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `Policy` object would be created and set as the value for the `policy` key, which would cause the `query` method to return a new `Policy` object instead of the actual policy object, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
