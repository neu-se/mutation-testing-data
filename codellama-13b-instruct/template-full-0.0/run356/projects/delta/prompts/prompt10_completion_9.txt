  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would cause the code to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator would cause the code to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator would cause the code to return a different value.

DONE.
