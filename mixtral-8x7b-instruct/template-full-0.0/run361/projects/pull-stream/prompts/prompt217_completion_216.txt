 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the script would terminate immediately, not waiting for the async operation to complete or propagating any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined` as the mapped value, even if the original `data` value should be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the returned value to uppercase, which might not be the desired behavior and could break the consumer's expectations.

DONE.
