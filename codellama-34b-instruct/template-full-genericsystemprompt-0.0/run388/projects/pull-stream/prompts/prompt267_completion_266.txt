  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `end` value, causing the `nextStream` function to be called even if the stream has ended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if `end` is falsy, so the `stream` variable would not be evaluated if `end` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || stream
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression if `end` is truthy, so the `stream` variable would not be evaluated if `end` is truthy.

DONE.
