  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new operation to the delta, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a different operation to the delta, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the last operation in the delta to the delta again, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
