  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, "invalid_base_url");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is used when calling the `parse()` function, and setting it to a string that is not a URL would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would be called with `baseUrlStr` set to `null`, which would cause it to return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url, "");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would be called with an empty string as the `baseUrlStr` argument, which would cause it to return an empty string.

DONE.
