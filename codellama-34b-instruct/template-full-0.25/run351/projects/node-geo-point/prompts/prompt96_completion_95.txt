  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude, which takes into account the latitude and longitude of the point, whereas this replacement only uses the longitude difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude, which takes into account the latitude and longitude of the point, whereas this replacement only uses the longitude difference and the cosine of the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 = λ1 + Δλ * sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `atan2` function to calculate the longitude, which takes into account the latitude and longitude of the point, whereas this replacement only uses the longitude difference and the sine of
