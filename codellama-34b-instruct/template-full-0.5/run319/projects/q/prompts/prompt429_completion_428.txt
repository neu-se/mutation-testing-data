  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call` method on the `inspect` property of the `object`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `call` method on the `inspect` property of the `object`, passing `this` as the `this` value, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
