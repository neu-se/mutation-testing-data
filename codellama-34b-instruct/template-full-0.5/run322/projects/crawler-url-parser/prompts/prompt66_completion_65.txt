  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\&/g).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of query parameters in the URL, rather than the number of key-value pairs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\?/g).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of query strings in the URL, rather than the number of key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.search.split(/\=/g).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of equal signs in the URL, which may not be the same as the number of key-value pairs.

DONE.
