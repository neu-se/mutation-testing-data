  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.retain === 'number' && otherOp.retain < 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` being negative would change the condition of the `if` statement and potentially cause the code to execute a different path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (typeof otherOp.retain === 'string')
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` operator will evaluate to `'string'` always for any non-number value, including `undefined`, so the condition would be always true and the code will execute a different path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherOp.retain !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` operator will always return `true` if `otherOp.retain` is not undefined, regardless of its type

DONE.
