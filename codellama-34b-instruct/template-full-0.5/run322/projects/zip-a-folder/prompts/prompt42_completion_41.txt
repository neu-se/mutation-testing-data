  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `file` is a method for adding a file to the archive, whereas `glob` is a method for adding files that match a pattern to the archive. Using `file` would only add a single file to the archive, whereas `glob` would add multiple files.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because `directory` is a method for adding a directory to the archive, whereas `glob` is a method for adding files that match a pattern to the archive. Using `directory` would only add a single directory to the archive, whereas `glob` would add multiple files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `finalize` is a method for finalizing the archive, whereas `glob` is a method for adding files that match a pattern to the archive. Using `finalize
