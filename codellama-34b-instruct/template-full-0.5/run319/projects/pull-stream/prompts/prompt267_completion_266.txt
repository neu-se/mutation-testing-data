  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `end`, which would cause the function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would always return `true`, regardless of the value of `end`, which would cause the function to always return `true`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `end`, which would cause the function to always return `false`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
