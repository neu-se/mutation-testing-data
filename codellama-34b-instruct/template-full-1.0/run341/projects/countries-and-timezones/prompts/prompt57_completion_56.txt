  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id && !countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only memoize the country if it exists in the `countries` object. The original code fragment would memoize the country regardless of whether it exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would memoize the country regardless of whether it exists or not. The original code fragment would only memoize the country if it exists in the `countries` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] || !countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always memoize the country, regardless of whether it exists or not. The original code fragment would only memoize the country if it exists in the `countries` object.

DONE.
