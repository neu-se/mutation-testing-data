  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is falsy using the `!` operator, while this replacement checks if `attributes` is strictly equal to `null`. This could cause the resulting delta to include additional retain ops that would not have been included in the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is falsy using the `!` operator, while this replacement checks if `attributes` is an empty array. This could cause the resulting delta to include additional retain ops that would not have been included in the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof attributes != 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `attributes` is falsy using the `!` operator, while this replacement checks if `attributes` is not an object. This could cause the
