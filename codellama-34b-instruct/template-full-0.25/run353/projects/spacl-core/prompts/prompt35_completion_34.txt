  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is removed, which would cause the path segments to be processed in the opposite order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the path segments to be processed starting from the second segment instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part of spec.split('/').slice(1, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method is called with a different argument, which would cause the path segments to be processed starting from the first segment and ending at the second-to-last segment.

DONE.
