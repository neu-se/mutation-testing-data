  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code assumes that `retain` is always a number, while the replacement assumes that it can be a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherOp.retain !== length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code assumes that `retain` is always equal to `length`, while the replacement checks if they are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return otherOp.attributes.length !== length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code assumes that `attributes.length` is always equal to `length`, while the replacement checks if they are not equal.

DONE.
