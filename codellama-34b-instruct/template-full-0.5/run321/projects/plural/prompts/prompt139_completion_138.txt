  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` returns the original word, while this replacement returns the word with the substring `ves` appended to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` returns the original word, while this replacement returns the word with the substring `i` appended to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `word` returns the original word, while this replacement returns the word with the substring `ies` appended to it.

DONE.
