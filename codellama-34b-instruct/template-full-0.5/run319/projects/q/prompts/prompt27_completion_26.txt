  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `domain` is an object, whereas `1 + 1` is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `domain` is an object, whereas `"hello"` is a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `domain` is an object, whereas `undefined` is a primitive value.

DONE.
