  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/b/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different character than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[ab]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of characters than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^ab]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different set of characters than the original code fragment.

DONE.
