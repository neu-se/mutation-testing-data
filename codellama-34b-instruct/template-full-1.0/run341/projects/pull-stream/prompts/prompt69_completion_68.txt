  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('error')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log('error')` would log a message to the console, while the original code `doneLackingErr` simply references a variable that may or may not be defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr = new Error('different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the error message that is thrown, while the original code `doneLackingErr` is simply a placeholder for an error that may be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('different error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a different error message, while the original code `doneLackingErr` may not throw an error at all.

DONE.
