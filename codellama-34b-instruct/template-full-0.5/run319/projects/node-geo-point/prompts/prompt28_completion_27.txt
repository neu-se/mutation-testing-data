  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, but `point1Rad` is already in radians. By calling `deg2rad` again, we would be converting `point1Rad` to radians twice, which would result in a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is a function that converts radians to degrees, but `point1Rad` is already in radians. By calling `rad2deg` on `point1Rad`, we would be converting `point1Rad` to degrees, which would result in a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because `point1Rad` is already
