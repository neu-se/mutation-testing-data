  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"done"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `cbs` variable, which is an array of callback functions. The modified code fragment is a string, which would not produce the same effect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `cbs` variable, which is an array of callback functions. The modified code fragment would result in null being passed as an argument to the `write` method, which would likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `cbs` variable, which is an array of callback functions. The modified code fragment would result in the `_data` property of the `Dirty` class being passed as an argument to the `write` method, which would likely cause an error.

DONE
