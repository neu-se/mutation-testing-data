 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number in radians, while `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sin
