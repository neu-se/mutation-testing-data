Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the search for the index of a space character instead of a newline character, potentially causing incorrect line breaks in the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the search for a tab character instead of a newline character, which may lead to incorrect parsing of lines if the input contains tab characters instead of newlines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an escape sequence for a backslash followed by 'n', which is not the same as a newline character, leading to incorrect line segmentation in the output.

DONE.
