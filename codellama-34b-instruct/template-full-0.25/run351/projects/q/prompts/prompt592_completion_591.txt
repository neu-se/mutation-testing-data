  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with a fixed array would cause the function to always use the same arguments, regardless of what was passed to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to always use a null value, regardless of what was passed to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that contains the values of the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `undefined` would
