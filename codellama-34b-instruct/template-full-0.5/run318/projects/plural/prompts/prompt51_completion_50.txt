  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds 'es' to the word, while this code adds 's' to the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds 'es' to the word, while this code adds 'ies' to the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' + w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code adds 'es' to the word, while this code adds 's' to the word and then adds the word again.

DONE.
