  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(next.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `next.promise` with the value of `head`, while this modified code resolves it with the value of `tail`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(Q.reject(error));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `next.promise` with a value, while this modified code rejects it with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.resolve(ends.promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code resolves `next.promise` with a value, while this modified code resolves it with the value of `ends.promise`, which is a different value.

DONE.
