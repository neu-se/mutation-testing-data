  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the first argument to the callback was null, but undefined is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the first argument to the callback was null, but false is a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checked if the first argument to the callback was null, but 0 is a different value.

DONE.
