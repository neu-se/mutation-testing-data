  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a value that is compared to `null`, rather than an object property as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a value that is compared to `undefined`, rather than an object property as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op != null && op != void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` is a value that is compared to `null` and `undefined` using the negation operator, rather than an object property as in the original code.

DONE.
