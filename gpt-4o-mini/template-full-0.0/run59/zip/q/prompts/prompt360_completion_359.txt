Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the promise to resolve multiple times, which contradicts the intended design of ensuring that the callbacks are called only once.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to explicitly check for `false`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if `done` is set to a truthy value that is not strictly `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the promise from resolving at all if `done` is `true`, effectively ignoring the resolution of the promise and potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

DONE.
