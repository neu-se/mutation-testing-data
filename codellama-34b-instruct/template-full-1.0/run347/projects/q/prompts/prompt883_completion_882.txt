  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom error message would be thrown instead of the original error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify("Custom notification message")
```
This would result in different behavior because a custom notification message would be sent instead of the original notification.

DONE.
