  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `null`, which would cause the `Delta` object to behave differently when it is composed with other `Delta` objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `0`, which would cause the `Delta` object to behave differently when it is composed with other `Delta` objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property would be set to `Infinity`, which would cause the `Delta` object to behave differently when it is composed with other `Delta` objects.

DONE.
