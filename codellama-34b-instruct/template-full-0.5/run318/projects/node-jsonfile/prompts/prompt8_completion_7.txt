  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the specified elements, whereas the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM (Byte Order Mark) from the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method returns an array of substrings, whereas the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM from the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method returns a substring starting at the specified position, whereas the original code uses the `stripBom` function to remove the BOM from the data.

DONE.
