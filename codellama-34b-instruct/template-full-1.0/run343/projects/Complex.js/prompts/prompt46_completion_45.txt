  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 're' && b === 'im'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the inputs `a` and `b` are equal to the strings `'re'` and `'im'`, respectively, rather than checking whether the object `a` has the properties `'re'` and `'im'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.hasOwnProperty('re') && b.hasOwnProperty('im')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check whether the object `a` has the property `'re'` and the object `b` has the property `'im'`, rather than checking whether the object `a` has the property `'im'` and the object `b` has the property `'re'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(a, 're') && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(b, 'im')
```
