  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!obj
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator will return a boolean value, which may cause the `stringify` function to produce a different output than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator will try to concatenate the `obj` with `null`, which may produce a different output than the original code fragment, especially if `obj` is not a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[Symbol.toStringTag]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Symbol.toStringTag` property is used to customize the string representation of an object, which may cause the `stringify` function to produce a different output than the original code fragment.

DONE.
