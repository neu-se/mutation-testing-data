```
/(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/e$/, '') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the /b at the end of the regular expression matches a word boundary, and if the word ends in "e" it will be removed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the /b at the start of the regular expression matches a word boundary, and it will return the word concatenated with "s" instead of just the word.

Option 3: The
