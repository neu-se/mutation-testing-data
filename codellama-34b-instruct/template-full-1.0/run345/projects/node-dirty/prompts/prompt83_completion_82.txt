  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the first occurrence of `\n` instead of the last.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the last occurrence of `\n` and then subtract 1, which would result in an invalid index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.lastIndexOf('\n') - chunk.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the last occurrence of `\n` and then subtract the entire length of the chunk, which would result in a negative index.

DONE.
