  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs && this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only update the `verbs` object if the `verb` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `verb` property from the `verbs` object, which may have unintended consequences if the property is being used elsewhere in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs[verb] = !this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would flip the value of the `verb` property in the `verbs` object, which may also have unintended consequences if the property is being used elsewhere in the code.

DONE.
