  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the promise is in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the first element of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the promise is in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a copy of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array instead of checking if the promise is in the array.

DONE.
