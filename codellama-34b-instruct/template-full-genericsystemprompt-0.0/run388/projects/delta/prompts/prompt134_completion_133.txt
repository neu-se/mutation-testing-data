  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with an `insert` property, but `nextOp.insert` is a string, and the code expects an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with a `retain` property, but `nextOp.retain` is a number, and the code expects an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextOp` is an object with a `delete` property, but `nextOp.delete` is a number, and the code expects an object.

DONE.
