  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and it may cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ERROR
```
This would result in different behavior because `ERROR` is a different value than `null`, and it may cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` (an empty string) is a different value than `null`, and it may cause the function to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
