 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is truthy, so `resolver` would not be called, and `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.fulfill`, and `deferred.reject` would not be assigned, leading to different promise behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is falsy, so `resolver` would not be called, and `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.fulfill`, and `deferred.reject` would not be assigned, leading to different promise behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is falsy, so `resolver` would not be called, and `deferred.resolve`, `deferred.fulfill`, and `deferred.reject` would not be assigned, leading to different promise behavior.
