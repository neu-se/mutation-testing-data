  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because `!ended` is the opposite of `ended`, so it would return the opposite boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the variable `ended` to `false`, regardless of its original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended == false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `true` if `ended` is `false`, but `false` if `ended` is `true`.

DONE.
