  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.call` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.bind` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.nbind.bind(null)` is a different method than `Q.nbind.apply`, and it would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
