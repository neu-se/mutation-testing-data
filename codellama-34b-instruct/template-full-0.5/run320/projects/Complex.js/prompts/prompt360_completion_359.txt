  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the context of the `tanh` function, and would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is used in the calculation of the `d` variable, and adding 1 to `b` would change the value of `d`, which is used in the calculation of the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` and `b` variables are used in the calculation of the `d` variable, and multiplying them together would change the value of `d`, which is used in the calculation of the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

DONE.
