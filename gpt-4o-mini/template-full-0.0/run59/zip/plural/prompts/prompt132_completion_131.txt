Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand, which would not correctly check if the first element of the rule is a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the second element of the rule array instead of checking the type of the first element, which would lead to incorrect handling of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the constructor name of the first element of the rule, which may not accurately determine if it is a regular expression, potentially leading to false positives or negatives in rule matching.

DONE.
