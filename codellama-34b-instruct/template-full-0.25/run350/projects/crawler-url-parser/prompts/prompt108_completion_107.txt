  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set()` method would be called with a `null` value, which would not be stored in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set()` method would be called with an `undefined` value, which would not be stored in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `urlMap.set()` method would be called with an empty object, which would not be stored in the map.

DONE.
