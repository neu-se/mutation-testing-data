  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and `exports` is an object, so the condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and `exports` is an object, so the condition would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and `exports` is an object, so the condition would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
