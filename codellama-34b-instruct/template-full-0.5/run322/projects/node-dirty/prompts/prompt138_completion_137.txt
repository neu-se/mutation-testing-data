  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val
```
This would result in different behavior because `val` is a property of the `row` object, but `key` is a property of the `this._data` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data[key]` is the value associated with the `key` property in the `this._data` object, but `val` is a property of the `row` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `row[key]` is the value associated with the `key` property in the `row` object, but `val` is a property of the `this._data` object.

DONE.
