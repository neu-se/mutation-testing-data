  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, but `array_slice.reverse()` would return the reversed version of the array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.length` would return the length of the array, but the original code fragment is using `array_slice` as a function to slice the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.pop()` would remove the last element of the array, but the original code fragment is using `array_slice` as a function to slice the array.

DONE.
