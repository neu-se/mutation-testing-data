  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain` is a different value than `op`, which would change the result of the `retain` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.attributes` is a different value than `op`, which would change the result of the `retain` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert` is a different value than `op`, which would change the result of the `retain` method.

DONE.
