  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].push.apply(args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an empty array, so `array_slice(arguments)` would also be an empty array, and `args.length` would be 0, which is a different value than the original `arguments.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([promise])
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is an array of arguments passed to `promiseDispatch`, while `promise` is not an argument and would be added to the array as a separate element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, promise]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates an array with `args` and `promise` as elements, while the new code fragment creates an array with `args` as an element and `promise` as the value of the element.

DONE.
