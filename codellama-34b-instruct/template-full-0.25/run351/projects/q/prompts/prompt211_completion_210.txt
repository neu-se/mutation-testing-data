  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because the `arguments` object would be passed as the second argument to `callback`, instead of the actual arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would be passed as the second argument to `callback`, instead of the actual arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would be passed as the second argument to `callback`, instead of the actual arguments.

DONE.
