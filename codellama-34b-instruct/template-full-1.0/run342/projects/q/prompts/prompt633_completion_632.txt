  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
"void", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `void` is a reserved word in JavaScript, and `void [key]` would return `undefined`, whereas the original code `delete [key]` would return `true` or `false`, depending on whether the property was successfully deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
"null", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value in JavaScript, and `null [key]` would return `null`, whereas the original code `delete [key]` would return `true` or `false`, depending on whether the property was successfully deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
"typeof", [key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator in JavaScript that returns a string indicating the type of a value, and `typeof [key]` would return the type of the value `key`, whereas the original code `delete [key]`
