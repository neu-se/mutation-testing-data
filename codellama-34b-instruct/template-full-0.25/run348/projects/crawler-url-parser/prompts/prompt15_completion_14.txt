  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the end-of-line anchor `$`, which matches the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the start-of-line anchor `^`, which matches the start of the string. This would cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the case-sensitive flag `/#.*$/`, while the new code fragment uses the case-insensitive flag `/#.*$/i`. This would cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the global flag `/#.*$/`, while the new code fragment uses the non-global flag `/#.*$/g`. This would
