  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosm1(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosm1` is a function that takes a single argument, but `b` is a complex number with both real and imaginary parts, so the function would only be applied to the real part of `b`, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
