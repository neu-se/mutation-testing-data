  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the argument is a finite number, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isNaN` is used to check if the argument is a number, but `isFinite` is more appropriate in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the argument is `NaN`, and `false` otherwise. In the original code, `isNaN` is used to check if the argument is a number, but `isNaN` is not appropriate in this context because it will return `true` for any non-number value, including `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of the argument as a string. In the original
