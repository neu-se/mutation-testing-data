  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (0 === d) {
  // Divisor is real
  return new Complex(a / c, b / c);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `d === 0` instead of `0 === d`, which could result in a different branch being taken when `d` is a falsy value like `0` or an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `this['isInfinite']()` or `z['isInfinite']()`, which could result in a different branch being taken when `this` or `z` is a complex number with either a real or imaginary part that is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
switch ((z['re'] %
