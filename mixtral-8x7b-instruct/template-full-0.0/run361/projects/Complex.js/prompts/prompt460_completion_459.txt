 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for exact equality with zero instead of checking if the absolute value is smaller than a given epsilon. This means that small non-zero values might not be considered as zero anymore.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.abs(a - this['re']) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the absolute difference between `a` and `this['re']` instead of just checking `a`. This could lead to unexpected results if there are other values in the code that are close to `this['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Complex['EPSILON'] > 0
