  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would no longer split the stack trace into separate lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the stack trace into separate lines, but would not remove the "at" prefix from each line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\s+"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would split the stack trace into separate lines, and would remove any whitespace characters (including spaces and tabs) from each line.

DONE.
