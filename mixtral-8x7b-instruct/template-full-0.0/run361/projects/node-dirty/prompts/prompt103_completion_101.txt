 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would not be accessed, and if the `row` object does not have a `key` property, it would not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'constant_key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would be replaced with a constant key, which would not change based on the current row being processed. This could lead to incorrect data being deleted or updated in the cache.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys().next().value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `row.key` would be replaced with the first key in the `_data` object, which may not be the correct key for the current row being processed. This could lead to incorrect data being deleted or updated in the cache.

DONE.
