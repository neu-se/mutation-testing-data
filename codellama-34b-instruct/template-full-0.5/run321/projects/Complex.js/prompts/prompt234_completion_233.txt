  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for the possibility of `a` being equal to zero, while this new code fragment does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows for the possibility of `a` being equal to zero, while this new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks the value of `a`, while this new code fragment checks the value of `b`.

DONE.
