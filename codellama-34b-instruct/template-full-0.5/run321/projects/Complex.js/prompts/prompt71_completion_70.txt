  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression matches any sequence of digits, decimal points, and scientific notation, while the new regular expression matches any sequence of letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\w+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression matches any sequence of digits, decimal points, and scientific notation, while the new regular expression matches any sequence of word characters (letters, digits, and underscores).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regular expression matches any sequence of digits, decimal points, and scientific notation, while the new regular expression matches any sequence of letters and digits.

DONE.
