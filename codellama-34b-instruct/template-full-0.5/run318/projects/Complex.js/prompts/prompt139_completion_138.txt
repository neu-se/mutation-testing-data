  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is zero, while this replacement checks if `z` is infinite and `z` is zero, which is a different condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is zero, while this replacement checks if `this` is infinite or `z` is not zero, which is a different condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this` is not infinite and `z` is not zero, while this replacement checks if `this` is not infinite and `z
