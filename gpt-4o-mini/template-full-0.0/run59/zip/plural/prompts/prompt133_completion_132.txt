Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the regular expression or string to a string type, which would cause the test `rule[0].test(word)` to fail for regular expressions, leading to incorrect pluralization.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `rule[0]` is `null`, which would always return false for valid rules, causing the pluralization logic to skip over all rules and default to appending 's' regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules[i][0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the first element of the `rules` array directly instead of the current `rule`, which could lead to incorrect matching against the wrong rule, potentially causing incorrect pluralization results.

DONE.
