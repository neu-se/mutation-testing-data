  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.insert` is a string, and if so, it concatenates it with the `newOp.insert` string. However, if `op.insert` is null, the code would throw a TypeError when trying to access its `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `op.insert` is a string, and if so, it concatenates it with the `newOp.insert` string. However, if `op.insert` is an empty string, the code would not throw an error, but it would still concatenate the empty string with `newOp.insert`, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if
