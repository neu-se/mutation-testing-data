  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin(b)` function has a different range and output values than the `sinh(b)` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos(a)` function has a different range and output values than the `sinh(b)` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tan(a)` function has a different range and output values than the `sinh(b)` function.

DONE.
