  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the `promise` object as an argument, while `null` is a constant value that does not have any effect on the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the `promise` object as an argument, while `undefined` is a constant value that does not have any effect on the behavior of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressed` is a function that is called with the `promise` object as an argument, while `promise.progressed` is a property that is not defined in the code and would result in a reference error.

DONE.
