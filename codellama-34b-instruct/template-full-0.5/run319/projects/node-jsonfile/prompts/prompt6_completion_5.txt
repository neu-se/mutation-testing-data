  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` method expects a function as its first argument, but `fs.readFile` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` method expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, but `fs.readFileSync` does not take a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile, { encoding: 'utf8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `universalify.fromCallback` method expects an options object as its second argument, but the object passed to `fs.readFile` has a different structure.

DONE.
