  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.delete` is a different value than `otherOp.insert`, and would cause the code to behave differently when composing the two operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different value than `otherOp.insert`, and would cause the code to behave differently when composing the two operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is a different value than `otherOp.insert`, and would cause the code to behave differently when composing the two operations.

DONE.
