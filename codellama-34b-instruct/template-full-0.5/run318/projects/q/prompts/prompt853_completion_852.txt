  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a function that is used to stop the execution of a function at specified intervals, while `clearTimeout` is a function that is used to stop the execution of a function after a specified amount of time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that is used to schedule the execution of a function after a specified amount of time, while `clearTimeout` is a function that is used to stop the execution of a function at specified intervals.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` is a function that is used to schedule the execution of a function at specified intervals, while `clearTimeout` is a function that is used to stop the execution of a function after a specified amount of time.

DONE.
