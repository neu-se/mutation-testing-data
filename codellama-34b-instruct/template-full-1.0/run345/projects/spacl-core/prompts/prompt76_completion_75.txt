Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let rule of this.rules) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `let` keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, whereas `const` declares a constant that cannot be reassigned. The `for...of` loop will then iterate over each rule in the array, but it will not modify the loop variable itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (var rule of this.rules) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `var` keyword declares a function-scoped variable, whereas `const` declares a constant that cannot be reassigned. The `for...of` loop will then iterate over each rule in the array, but it will not modify the loop variable itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const rule of this.rules) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `const` keyword declares a constant that cannot be reass
