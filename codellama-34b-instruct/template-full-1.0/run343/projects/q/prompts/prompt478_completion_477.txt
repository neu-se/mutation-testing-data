  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would expect the `unhandledRejections` array to have a length of 1 after the promise is rejected, but with this change, the array would have a length of 0, causing the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would expect the `unhandledReasons` array to have a length of 0 after the promise is resolved, but with this change, the array would have a length of 2, causing the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the test suite would expect the `unhandledRejections` array to have a length of 1 after the promise is rejected, but with this change, the array would have a length of 0, causing the test to fail.

DONE.
