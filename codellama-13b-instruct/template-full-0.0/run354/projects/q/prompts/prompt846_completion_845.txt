  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise, whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given value (or promised value).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given value (or promised value), whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer` is a function that returns a deferred object, which can be used to create a promise for the resolution of a value (or promised value), whereas `Q` is a function that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise.
