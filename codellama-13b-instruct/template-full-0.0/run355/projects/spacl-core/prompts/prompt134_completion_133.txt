  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `in` operator is used instead of the `===` operator, which would cause the `query` method to always return `null` regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb === this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is used instead of the `in` operator, which would cause the `query` method to always return `false` regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb !== this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of the `in` operator, which would cause the `query` method to always return `true` regardless of the input.

DONE.
