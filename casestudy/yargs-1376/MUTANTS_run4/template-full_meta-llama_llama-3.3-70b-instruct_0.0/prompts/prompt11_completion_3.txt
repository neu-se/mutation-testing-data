Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extend'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking for a property named 'extend' instead of 'extends', potentially allowing configurations with 'extends' properties to bypass the extension logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the 'extends' property of the config object is its own property, rather than checking if it has an 'extends' property, potentially causing the extension logic to fail if the 'extends' property is inherited.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'extends' in config
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the config object has an 'extends' property anywhere in its prototype chain, rather than checking if it has its own 'extends' property, potentially causing the extension logic to be triggered by inherited 'extends' properties.

DONE.
