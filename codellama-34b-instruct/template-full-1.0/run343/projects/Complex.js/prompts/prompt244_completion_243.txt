  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, so using `Math.sin` instead of `Math.cos` would produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, so using `Math.exp` instead of `Math.cos` would produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cosh` and `Math.cos` have different outputs for the same input, so using `Math.cosh` instead of `Math.cos` would produce incorrect results.

DONE.
