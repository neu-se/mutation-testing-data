  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an array and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"keys"
```
This would result in different behavior because "keys" is a string and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an array and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
