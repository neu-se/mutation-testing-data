 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the initial value of the loop variable, potentially skipping the first iteration or causing the loop to iterate one extra time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
const i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it declares `i` as a constant, causing an error if any attempt is made to modify its value within the loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
let i = '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the loop variable from a number to a string, potentially causing the loop to behave unexpectedly if the comparison is done using the `<` or `>` operators.

DONE.
