 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `pull` will always be `1`, instead of the original `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the current execution context, which may not be the desired `read` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random number, instead of using the original `read` function.

DONE.
