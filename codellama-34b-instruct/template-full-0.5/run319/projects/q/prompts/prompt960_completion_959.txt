  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an empty array, rather than an array containing the `thisp` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing `undefined`, rather than an array containing the `thisp` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would return an array containing the string "foo", rather than an array containing the `thisp` argument.

DONE.
