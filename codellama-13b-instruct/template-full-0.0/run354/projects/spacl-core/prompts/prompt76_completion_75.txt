  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the first rule in the policy, regardless of the path or action being queried.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.rules.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a rule from the policy, which could lead to different results depending on the order of the rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const rule = this.rules.find((rule) => rule.matches(path, ctx))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the first rule that matches the path and context, which could lead to different results depending on the order of the rules.

DONE.
