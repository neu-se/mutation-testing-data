  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the index to be incremented by one, which could result in the code skipping over a critical section of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the index to be decremented by one, which could result in the code skipping over a critical section of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the index to be multiplied by two, which could result in the code skipping over a critical section of the code.

DONE.
