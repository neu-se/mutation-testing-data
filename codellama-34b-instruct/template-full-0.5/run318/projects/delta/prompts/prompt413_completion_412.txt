  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peekLength()` returns the length of the current operation in the iterator, while `thisIter.peekLength` returns the length of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the next operation, while `thisIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the next operation, while `thisIter.peekLength` returns the length of the current operation.

DONE.
