  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0, 0, other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` modifies the original array, while `concat()` returns a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(other.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds an element to the end of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

DONE.
