  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.fail` would return a rejected promise if the promise is rejected, whereas `result.done` would return a resolved promise with the rejection reason as its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.isRejected` would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is rejected, whereas `result.done` would return a resolved promise with the rejection reason as its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `result.isFulfilled` would return a boolean indicating whether the promise is fulfilled, whereas `result.done` would return a resolved promise with the fulfillment value as its value.

DONE.
