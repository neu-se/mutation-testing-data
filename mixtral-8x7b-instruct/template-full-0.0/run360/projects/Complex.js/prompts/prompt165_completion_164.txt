 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison checks for a specific infinite value, while the original code checks if the value is generally infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value is zero, while the original code checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!this['isFinite']()
