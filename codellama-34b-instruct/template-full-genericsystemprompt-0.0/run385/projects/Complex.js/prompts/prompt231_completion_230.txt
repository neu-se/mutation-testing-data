  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the product of the real and imaginary parts instead of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of the real and imaginary parts instead of the imaginary part.

DONE.
