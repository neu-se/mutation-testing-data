  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "memo," which is "memos." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "memo" would cause the function to return the singular form of the word, which is "memo."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "memo," which is "memos." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "memos" would cause the function to return the plural form of the word, which is "memos."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'memoes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of the word "memo," which is "memos." Replacing the PLACEHOLDER with "memoes"
