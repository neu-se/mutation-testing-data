  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src", true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the directory to be archived recursively, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src", false, { includeDotFiles: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include hidden files in the archive, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src", { filter: (file) => !file.isDirectory() }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only include files and not directories in the archive, which may not be the desired behavior.

DONE.
