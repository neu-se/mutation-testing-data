  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.slice(0).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array with the elements in reverse order, instead of modifying the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse().slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would first reverse the array and then return a new array with all the elements, instead of modifying the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
props.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the array in place, without returning a new array.

DONE.
