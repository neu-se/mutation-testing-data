  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes one argument, but `once(end, null)` would pass two arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes one argument, but `once(end, undefined)` would pass two arguments, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
once(end, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `once` is a function that takes one argument, but `once(end, false)` would pass two arguments, which would cause an error.

DONE.
