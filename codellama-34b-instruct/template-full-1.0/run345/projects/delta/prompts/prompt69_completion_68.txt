  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof length === 'number' && length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the current object if the length is 0, while the replaced code would return the current object if the length is greater than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the current object if the length is 0, while the replaced code would return the current object if the length is 1 or less.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would return the current object if the length is 0, while the replaced code would return the current object if the length is 0. However, this mutated code would always return the current object, regardless of the length of the given op.

DONE.
