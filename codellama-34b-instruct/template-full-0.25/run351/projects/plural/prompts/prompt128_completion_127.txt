  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, potentially causing the function to return the wrong result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= rules.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

DONE.
