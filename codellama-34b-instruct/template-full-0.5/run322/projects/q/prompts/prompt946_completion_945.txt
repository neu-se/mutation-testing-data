  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method would change the value of `this` inside the `makeNodeResolver` function, which could potentially cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would create a new function that is bound to `null` as the `this` value, which could potentially cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method would call the `makeNodeResolver` function with `null` as the `this` value, which could potentially cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
