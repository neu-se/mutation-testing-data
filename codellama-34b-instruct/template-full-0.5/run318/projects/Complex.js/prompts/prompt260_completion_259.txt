  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a variable `a` that is used in the calculation, but the replaced code fragment has a constant `1` that is added to `a`. This would change the result of the calculation and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a` in the calculation, but the replaced code fragment uses the variable `b`. This would change the result of the calculation and potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the variable `a` in the calculation, but the replaced code fragment multiplies `a` by `2`. This would change the result of the calculation and potentially cause the test to fail.

DONE.
