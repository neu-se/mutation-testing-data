  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process !== null && typeof process.emit === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `process` is not null before checking if `process.emit` is a function. If `process` is null, the expression would return false, even if `process.emit` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `process.emit` is undefined, rather than checking if it is a function. If `process.emit` is not undefined, the expression would return false, even if it is not a function.
