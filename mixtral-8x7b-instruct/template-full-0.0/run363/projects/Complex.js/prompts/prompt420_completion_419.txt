 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / d === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the reciprocal of `d` is exactly equal to zero, which is never true for non-zero `d`. The original code checks if `d` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d === Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `d` is equal to infinity, which is not the same as checking if `d` is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d.toString() === '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string representation of `d` is equal to '0', which is not the same as checking if `d` is zero.

DONE.
