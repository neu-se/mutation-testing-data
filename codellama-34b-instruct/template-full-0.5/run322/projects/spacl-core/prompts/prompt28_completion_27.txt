  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function would return a regex that matches the entire path, instead of just the last segment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function would return a regex that matches the entire path, except for the last segment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function would return a regex that matches the entire path, but only if the last segment is a wildcard.

DONE.
