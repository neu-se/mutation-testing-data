  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the contents of the `src` directory instead of excluding them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dst, false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the contents of the `dst` directory instead of including them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"src", false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the contents of the `src` directory instead of including them, and it would also include the directory itself instead of excluding it.

DONE.
