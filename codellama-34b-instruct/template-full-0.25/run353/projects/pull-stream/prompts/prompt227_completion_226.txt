  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would invert the boolean value of `test`. If `test` is `true`, then `!test` would be `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, which would return `false` if either operand is `false`. If `test` is `true`, then `test && false` would be `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, which would return `true` if either operand is `true`. If `test` is `false`, then `test || true` would be `true`, and vice versa.

DONE.
