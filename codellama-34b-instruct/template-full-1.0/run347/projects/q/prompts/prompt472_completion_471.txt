  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas `splice(...)` was used to remove an element at a specific index. If the last element was unhandled, the behavior would be different, as `pop()` would not remove it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, whereas `splice(...)` was used to remove an element at a specific index. If the first element was unhandled, the behavior would be different, as `shift()` would not remove it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.unshift(reportedUnhandledRejections.pop());
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift(...)` adds an element to the beginning of the array, whereas
