  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of keys, while `tzs` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of values, while `tzs` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs, while `tzs` is an object.

DONE.
