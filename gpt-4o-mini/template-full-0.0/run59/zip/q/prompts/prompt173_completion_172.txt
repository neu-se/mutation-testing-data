Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.unshift(line);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the line to the beginning of the `desiredLines` array instead of the end, reversing the order of the lines collected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line.toUpperCase());
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts each line to uppercase before adding it to the `desiredLines` array, potentially altering the content of the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.push(line.replace(/error/g, 'warning'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces occurrences of the word "error" with "warning" in each line before adding it to the `desiredLines` array, changing the meaning of the stack trace.

DONE.
