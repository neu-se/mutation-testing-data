Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the reference from the entire `currentUrl` object to just its `url` property, potentially leading to incorrect type checks or missing properties in subsequent logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to receive `null` instead of a `currentUrl` object, leading to runtime errors or incorrect type determination since the function expects an object with specific properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseurl` property of the `currentUrl` object to the `gettype` function instead of the entire `currentUrl` object, which would likely result in incorrect type classification since `baseurl` does not contain the necessary properties for the logic in `gettype`.

DONE.
