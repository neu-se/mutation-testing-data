Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of the `fulfilled` callback would cause the promise to not invoke any fulfillment handler, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` as the fulfillment callback would similarly prevent any fulfillment handler from being called, resulting in the promise being resolved without executing the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Fulfillment error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the fulfillment callback with a function that throws an error would cause the promise to be rejected immediately, rather than fulfilling successfully, thus altering the expected flow of execution.

DONE.
