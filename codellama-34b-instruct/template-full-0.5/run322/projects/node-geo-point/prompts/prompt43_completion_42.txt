  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 180 degrees to the longitude of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude of the second point, which could lead to incorrect calculations and results.

DONE.
