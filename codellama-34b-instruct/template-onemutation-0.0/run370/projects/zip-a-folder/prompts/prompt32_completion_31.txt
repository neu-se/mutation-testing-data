  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the archive is finalized and the output stream is closed, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error during the archiving process. By replacing `'error'` with `'close'`, the code would no longer handle errors correctly, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.

DONE.
