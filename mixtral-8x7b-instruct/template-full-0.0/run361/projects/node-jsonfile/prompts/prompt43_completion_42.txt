 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a number instead of the serialized object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'buggy string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the same string instead of the serialized object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random number instead of the serialized object, making the output unpredictable.

These changes introduce bugs that would not be caught by the current test suite, as they modify the return value of the `writeFileSync` function. By introducing these mutations, the test suite can be improved to account for these edge cases and ensure better test coverage.

DONE.
