  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.reverse())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the function in reverse order, which may cause the function to operate differently or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.concat([undefined]))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the end of the arguments array, which may cause the function to behave differently or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args.slice(0, 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass only the first argument to the function, which may cause the function to operate differently or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
