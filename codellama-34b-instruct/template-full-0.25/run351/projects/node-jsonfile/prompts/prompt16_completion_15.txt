  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile` is a different function than `_readFile`, and it has a different purpose. `_writeFile` is used to write data to a file, while `_readFile` is used to read data from a file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
