  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections.indexOf(promise)` would return -1, which would cause the `if` statement to be skipped, even if `promise` is in `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections.includes(promise)` would return `false`, even if `promise` is in `reportedUnhandledRejections`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.findIndex(p => p === promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections.findIndex(p => p === promise)` would return -1, which would cause the `if` statement to be
