  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('read_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'read_close' event only when the read stream is closed, while the new code emits it immediately after the read stream is created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('write_close');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'write_close' event only when the write stream is closed, while the new code emits it immediately after the write stream is created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Read stream closed unexpectedly'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not emit an error event when the read stream is closed, while the new code emits an error event with a message indicating that the read stream was closed unexpectedly.

DONE.
