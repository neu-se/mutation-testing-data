  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.value;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the fulfillment value instead of the inspected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.reason;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the rejection reason instead of the inspected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inspected.state;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the inspected value instead of the inspected value itself.

DONE.
