  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This change will cause the `all` function to reject the promise instead of resolving it, which will result in the `allResolved` function returning a rejected promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This change will cause the `all` function to notify the promise instead of resolving it, which will result in the `allResolved` function returning a pending promise instead of a fulfilled one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `all` function to return `undefined` instead of a promise, which will result in the `allResolved` function returning a rejected promise with a `TypeError` exception.

DONE.
