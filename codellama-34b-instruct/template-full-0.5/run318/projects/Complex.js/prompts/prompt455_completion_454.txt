  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` is a different method than `isNaN`, and it would return a different value.

DONE.
