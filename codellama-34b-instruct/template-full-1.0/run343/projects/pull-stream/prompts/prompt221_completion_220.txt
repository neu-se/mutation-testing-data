  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator performs logical NOT on the boolean value of `data`, which would result in the opposite of the intended behavior. For example, if `data` is `true`, `!data` would evaluate to `false`, and if `data` is `false`, `!data` would evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` would perform integer multiplication on `data`, which would result in `0` if `data` is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `data.length` would access the `length` property of the `data` object, which might not exist or might have a different value than the original code fragment.

DONE.
