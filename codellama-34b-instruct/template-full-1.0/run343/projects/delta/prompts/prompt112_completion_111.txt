  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `partition` method to always return the first element of the array, regardless of the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reduce` method to always return the sum of the lengths of all elements in the array, regardless of the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` method to always return the `insert` property of the current element, regardless of the predicate function.

DONE.
