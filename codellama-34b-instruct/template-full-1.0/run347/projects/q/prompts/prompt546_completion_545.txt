  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `arg`, and it would cause the function to behave differently in the context where `arg` is being used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `arg`, and it would cause the function to behave differently in the context where `arg` is being used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is a different value than `arg`, and it would cause the function to behave differently in the context where `arg` is being used.

DONE.
