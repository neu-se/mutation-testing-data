  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` is a bound function that will always refer to the current `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` may refer to a different context depending on how it is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this, arguments)` will always call `this.dispatch` with the current `this` context and the arguments passed to the function, whereas `this.dispatch` may be called with a different context and arguments depending on how it is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this, arguments)` will always call `this.dispatch` with the current `this` context and the arguments passed to the function
