Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a `null` value to the `args` array, which could lead to unexpected results when the method is called, as it alters the arguments passed to the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, name
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the positions of `args` and `name`, which would cause the method to receive the arguments in the wrong order, potentially leading to errors or incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only passes the first element of the `args` array to the method, ignoring any additional arguments that may be necessary for the function to execute correctly.

DONE.
