  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` instead of `aborted`, which may cause the program to behave differently than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `undefined` instead of `aborted`, which may cause the program to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted + 1
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `aborted + 1` instead of `aborted`, which may cause the program to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
