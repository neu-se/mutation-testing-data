  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `URL.format()` to format the URL, which includes the protocol and hostname, while `parsedUrl.pathname` only includes the pathname.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `URL.format()` to format the URL, which includes the protocol and hostname, while `parsedUrl.path` only includes the path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.href
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `URL.format()` to format the URL, which includes the protocol and hostname, while `parsedUrl.href` only includes the URL without the protocol and hostname.

DONE.
