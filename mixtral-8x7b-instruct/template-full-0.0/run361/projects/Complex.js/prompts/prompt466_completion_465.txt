 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b < 1e-15
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks if the imaginary part is less than a very small value instead of checking if it's equal to zero. This might cause real numbers to be treated as complex numbers with a small imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.im === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison now checks the instance variable directly instead of the input argument. This might cause issues if the instance variable and the input argument are not in sync.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0 === Object.is(b, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Object.is()` method for comparison, which handles `-0` and `NaN` differently than the equality operator `==`. This might cause unexpected results when comparing the imaginary part to zero.

DONE.
