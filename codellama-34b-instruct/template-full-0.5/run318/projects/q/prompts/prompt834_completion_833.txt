  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, "progress"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` argument is now a string, rather than a function. This would cause the `then` method to throw an error when it tries to call the `progress` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` argument is now `null`, rather than a function. This would cause the `then` method to ignore the `progress` function and not call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled, rejected, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progress` argument is now `undefined`, rather than a function. This would cause the `then` method to ignore the `progress` function and not call it.

DONE.
