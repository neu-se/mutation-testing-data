  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anySettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved once all promises in an array are settled, while `anySettled` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved once any promise in an array is settled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"noneSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved once all promises in an array are settled, while `noneSettled` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved once none of the promises in an array are settled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"lastSettled"
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise that is resolved once all promises in an array are settled, while `lastSettled` is a method that returns a promise
