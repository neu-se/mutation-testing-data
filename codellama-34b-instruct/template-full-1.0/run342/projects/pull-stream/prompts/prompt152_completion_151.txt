  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` variable is not initialized in the original code, and returning it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
underscore.constant(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `underscore.constant` is a different function than `cb`, and it would be called with the same arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with different arguments than `cb`, and it would have a different return value.

DONE.
