  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part of the `Complex` number is zero, which is not the same as checking if the number is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the real part of the `Complex` number is zero, which is not the same as checking if the number is zero.

DONE.
