  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method checks if a complex number is infinite, while the `isZero` method checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `re` property returns the real part of a complex number, while the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `im` property returns the imaginary part of a complex number, while the `isZero` method checks if the complex number is equal to zero.

DONE.
