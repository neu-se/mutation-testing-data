  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `result[country]` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`. If `result[country]` is a falsy value other than `undefined`, such as `null` or `false`, the original code fragment would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `result[country]` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `null`. If `result[country]` is a value other than `null` or `undefined`, the original code fragment would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] === 'DEFAULT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `result[country]` is fals
