  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is always non-zero, while `0` is a constant that would cause the `while` loop to terminate immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one fewer times, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time, potentially causing the code to access out-of-bounds array indices or perform unnecessary operations.

DONE.
