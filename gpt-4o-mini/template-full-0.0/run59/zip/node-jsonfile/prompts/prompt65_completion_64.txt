Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split(/^\uFEFF/)
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` will return an array of strings instead of a single string with the BOM removed, which changes the output type and structure.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the BOM with a space instead of removing it will alter the content of the string, potentially affecting subsequent parsing or processing of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because `trim` removes whitespace from both ends of the string, which does not specifically target the BOM and may lead to unintended removal of other characters.

DONE.
