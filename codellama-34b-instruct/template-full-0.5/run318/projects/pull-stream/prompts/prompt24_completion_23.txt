  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the third element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be using the sum of the first two elements of the `ref` array instead of the first element.

DONE.
