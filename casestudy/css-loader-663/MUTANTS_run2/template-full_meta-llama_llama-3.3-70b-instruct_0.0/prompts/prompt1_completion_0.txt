Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof url === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the original condition, causing the function to return the url immediately if it is a string, rather than if it's not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a specific value (null) rather than the type of the variable, potentially allowing non-string but non-null values to pass through without being escaped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the url is an instance of the String object, rather than just being a string primitive, which could lead to different results if the function is called with a String object instead of a string literal.

DONE.
