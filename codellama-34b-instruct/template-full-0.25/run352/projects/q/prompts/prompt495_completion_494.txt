  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection
```
This would result in different behavior because `untrackRejection` is a function that removes a promise from the list of unhandled rejections, whereas `trackRejection` is a function that adds a promise to the list of unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackRejection(promise, reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `trackRejection` function with the `promise` and `reason` arguments, which would add the promise to the list of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with the `promise` argument, which would remove the promise from the list of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
