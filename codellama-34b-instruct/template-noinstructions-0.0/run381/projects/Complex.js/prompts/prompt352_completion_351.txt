  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the complex arcus cosecans, while the replaced code fragment `a` is used to calculate the complex arcus secant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the complex arcus cosecans, while the replaced code fragment `c` is used to calculate the complex arcus secans.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
d
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the complex arcus cosecans, while the replaced code fragment `d` is used to calculate the complex arcus secans.

DONE.
