 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element from the array and returns it, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` adds an element to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rules.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` can be used to add or remove elements from an array at a specified index, and returns an array of the deleted elements, whereas `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array and returns the new length of the array.

DONE.
