  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a different method than `console.warn`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` is a different method than `console.warn`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log('done')
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log('done')` is a different method call than `console.warn`.

DONE.
