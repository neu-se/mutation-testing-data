  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log(c + sqrt(c^2 - 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 1))`, which is the correct formula for the `acosh` function. The modified code fragment uses `log(c + sqrt(c^2 - 1))`, which is not the correct formula for the `acosh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 0))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 1))`, which is the correct formula for the `acosh` function. The modified code fragment uses `log(c + sqrt(c^2 + 0))`, which is not the correct formula for the `acosh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acos(c)
