  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses at the end of the `trim` method, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `length` property at the end of the `trim` method, which would cause the code to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the `toLowerCase` method at the end of the `trim` method, which would cause the code to return a different value.

DONE.
