 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.hypot(point.latitude - this.latitude, point.longitude - this.longitude) * 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the Euclidean distance between two points, not the distance on the surface of the Earth using the Haversine formula.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
2 * Math.sqrt(Math.pow(point.latitude - this.latitude, 2) + Math.pow(point.longitude - this.longitude, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the distance between two points using the Euclidean distance formula multiplied by 2, which does not accurately represent the distance on the surface of the Earth.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.abs(point.latitude - this.latitude) + Math.abs(point.longitude
