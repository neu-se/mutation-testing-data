  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because `values` is not a valid method for a promise, while `keys` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", [1]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `[1]` as an argument to `values` would result in a `TypeError` when the code attempts to access the `length` property of the passed argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument to `values` would result in a `TypeError` when the code attempts to access the `length` property of the passed argument.

DONE.
