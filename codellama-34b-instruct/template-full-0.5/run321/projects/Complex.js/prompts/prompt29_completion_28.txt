  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to use the value of `b` instead of `a`, which could lead to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to use the product of `a` and `b` instead of their sum, which could lead to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `logHypot` function to use the sum of `a` and `b` instead of their product, which could lead to a different result.

DONE.
