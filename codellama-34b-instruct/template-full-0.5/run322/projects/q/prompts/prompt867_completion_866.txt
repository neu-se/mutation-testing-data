  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.resolve(value)` but this change uses `deferred.reject(value)`. This would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.resolve(value)` but this change uses `deferred.notify(value)`. This would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.resolve(value)` but this change uses `deferred.resolve(null)`. This would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value, which could cause the program to behave differently.
