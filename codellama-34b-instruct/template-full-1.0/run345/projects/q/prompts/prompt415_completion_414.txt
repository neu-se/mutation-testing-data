  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` and `isPromise` are different functions with different purposes. While `isPromise` checks if an object is a promise, `isFulfilled` checks if an object is a fulfilled value or a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `isRejected` and `isPromise` are different functions with different purposes. While `isPromise` checks if an object is a promise, `isRejected` checks if an object is a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` and `isPromise` are related but not identical functions. While `isPromise` checks if an object is a promise, `isPending` checks if an object is a pending promise, which
