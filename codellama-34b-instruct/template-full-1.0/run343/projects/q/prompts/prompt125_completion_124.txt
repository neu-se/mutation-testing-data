  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method binds the value of `this` inside the function to the first argument of `call`, which is the object being checked for the property. This means that `object_hasOwnProperty.call(this, key)` will only return `true` if the property is defined in the object being checked, regardless of whether it is defined in the object's prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object_hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` inverts the result of the function. So, if `object_hasOwnProperty(key)` returns `false`, `!object_hasOwnProperty(key)` will return `true`, and vice versa. This means that if the property is not defined in the object being checked, the `if` statement will evaluate to `true`, even if it is defined in
