  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `Array.prototype.slice` is a method that returns a new array containing a portion of the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments.slice()` is a method that returns a new array containing a portion of the original array, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)` is a method that returns a new array containing a portion of the original array, while `array_slice` is a function that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
