  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, but this new code fragment checks if `z` is zero and also passes `0` as an argument to the `isZero` method, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `z` is zero, but this new code fragment checks if `z` is zero and also passes `1` as an argument to the `isZero` method, which could potentially change the behavior of the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z)
```
