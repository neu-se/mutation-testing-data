  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is not supposed to be called until the async operation is complete, but `abortCb()` would call it immediately, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(aborted, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with two arguments, which could cause an error because `cb` is only defined with one argument. Additionally, passing `aborted` as the first argument could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `cb` function with a different set of arguments than the original code, which could cause the function to behave differently than expected.

DONE.
