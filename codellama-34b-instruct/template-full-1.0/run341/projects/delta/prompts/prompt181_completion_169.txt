  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would move the other iterator to the next position, whereas `otherIter.next` does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - 1` would decrease the value of `length` by 1, which could cause the loop to terminate earlier than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(Math.max(0, length - 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max(0, length - 1)` would ensure that the value of `length` is always greater than or equal to 1, which could prevent the loop from terminating early.

DONE.
