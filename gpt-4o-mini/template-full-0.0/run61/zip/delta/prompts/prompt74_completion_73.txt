Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` method to return the current instance of `Delta` without pushing the new operation, effectively ignoring the `retain` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the attributes of the new operation to `null`, which could lead to unexpected behavior when the attributes are expected to be an object, potentially causing errors in subsequent operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push({ retain: length + 1 });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the length of the retain operation by adding 1, which could lead to incorrect retention of characters or elements in the operation, altering the intended behavior of the `retain` method.

DONE.
