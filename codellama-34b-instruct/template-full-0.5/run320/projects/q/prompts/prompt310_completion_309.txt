  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve, resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise, regardless of whether the original promise was rejected or resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject, reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject the promise, regardless of whether the original promise was rejected or resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(x, y) { return x + y; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always resolve the promise with the sum of the values of the original promise, regardless of whether the original promise was rejected or resolved.

DONE.
