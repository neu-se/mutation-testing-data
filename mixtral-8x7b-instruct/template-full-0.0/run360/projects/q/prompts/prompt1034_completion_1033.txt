 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
qEndingLine = 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `qEndingLine` is being reassigned to a number instead of capturing the line number. This change will cause the custom error message in the `Q.noConflict` function to always have the same line number, which is not the actual line number where the conflict occurs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
var qEndingLine = <PLACEHOLDER>;
...
Q.noConflict = function() {
    throw new Error("Q.noConflict only works when Q is used as a global" + qEndingLine);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `qEndingLine` variable is declared with `var`, making it local to the IIFE. As a result, the `qEndingLine` variable inside the `noConflict` function will be `undefined`, and the error message will not include the correct line number.
