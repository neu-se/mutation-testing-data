  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two copies of the key to the `get` method, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `get` method, which would likely result in an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the value of the key variable before passing it to the `get` method, which would likely result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
