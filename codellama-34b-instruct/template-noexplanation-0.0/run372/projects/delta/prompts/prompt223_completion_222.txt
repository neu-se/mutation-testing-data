  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0]
```
This will cause the diff function to compare the first string in the strings array with itself, which will always result in an empty diff.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1] + 'a'
```
This will cause the diff function to compare the first string in the strings array with a modified version of the second string, which will always result in a non-empty diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].split('').reverse().join('')
```
This will cause the diff function to compare the first string in the strings array with a reversed version of itself, which will always result in a non-empty diff.

DONE.
