  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr1.diff(attr2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `AttributeMap.diff` to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr1.invert(attr2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `AttributeMap.invert` to be called with the arguments in the wrong order, which would result in incorrect attribute manipulation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new AttributeMap(attr1).diff(attr2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause `AttributeMap.diff` to be called on a newly created object, rather than the existing `attr1` object, which could cause the attributes to be incorrectly compared.

DONE.
