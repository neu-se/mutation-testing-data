  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value and will not call the `cb` function, while the original code fragment `cb` is a truthy value and will call the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log` is a function that will print a message to the console, while the original code fragment `cb` is a variable that represents a callback function and should be called with the appropriate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function notCb() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `notCb` is a different function than the original `cb` function, and it will not have the same behavior when it is called.

DONE.
