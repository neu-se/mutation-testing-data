  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a word with the last two characters removed and replaced with 'i', while this new code fragment would return a word with the last two characters removed and replaced with 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return a word with the last two characters removed and replaced with 'i', while this new code fragment would return a word with the last two characters removed and replaced with 'us'.
