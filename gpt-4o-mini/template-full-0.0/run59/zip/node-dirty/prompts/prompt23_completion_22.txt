Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('error', new Error('Drain error')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of emitting a 'drain' event, it emits an 'error' event, which could lead to unhandled errors in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', 'extra data'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event with an additional argument ('extra data'), which could cause listeners expecting a different signature to malfunction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain', null); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the 'drain' event with a null argument, which may not be handled correctly by listeners that expect a specific value or type.

DONE.
