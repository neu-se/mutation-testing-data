  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a distinct object from `undefined`, and the `compress` function expects a callback function to be passed as an argument.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
console.log("compressing...");
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a `console.log` statement, and the `compress` function expects a callback function to be passed as an argument.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
function() {
    console.log("compressing...");
}
```
This would result in different behavior because this is a function that takes no arguments and returns `undefined`, whereas the `compress` function expects a callback function that takes an error object as an argument.

DONE.
