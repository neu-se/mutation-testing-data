 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of checking if a handler exists for the given embed type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return an empty object instead of checking if a handler exists for the given embed type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(embedType) => { /* empty arrow function */ }
