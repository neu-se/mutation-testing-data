  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<code fragment>
this['re'] = -this['im'];
this['im'] = tmp;
tmp = res['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be done with the wrong variables, resulting in a mathematically incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<code fragment>
this['re'] = tmp - this['im'];
this['im'] = -this['re'];
tmp = res['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be done with the wrong variables and with incorrect signs, resulting in a mathematically incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```<code fragment>
this['re'] = tmp + this['im'];
this['im'] = -this['re'];
tmp = res['re'];
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculation would be done with the wrong variables and with incorrect signs, resulting in a mathematically incorrect result.

DONE
