  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the code would enter the `if` block if `countries[id]` is truthy, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `countries[id]` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the code would enter the `if` block if `countries[id]` is undefined, whereas the original code would enter the `if` block if `countries[id]` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, id)` checks if the `id` property is
