  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'data'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'data'` is not emitted by the `Dirty` class, whereas the event `'error'` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'end'` is not emitted by the `Dirty` class, whereas the event `'error'` is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event `'load'` is not emitted by the `Dirty` class, whereas the event `'error'` is.

DONE.
