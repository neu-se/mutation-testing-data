  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, while the `length` property returns the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, while the `length - 1` expression returns the index of the last character in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string, while the `length + 1` expression returns the index of the last character in the string plus one.

DONE.
