  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that would reject the promise, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` is a function that would dispatch the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would not have the method `resolve`, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would not have the method `reject`, whereas `self.promiseDispatch` does.

DONE.
