  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on a string. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError exception.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "get" method to retrieve a property from an object. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "set" method to set a property on an object. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError exception.

DONE.
