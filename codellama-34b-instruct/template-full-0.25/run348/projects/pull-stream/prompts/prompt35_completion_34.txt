  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be referring to the second element of the `ref` array instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be adding 1 to the value of the first element of the `ref` array, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value of the first element is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be multiplying the value of the first element of the `ref` array by 2, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value of the first element is not 1.

DONE.
