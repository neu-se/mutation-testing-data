  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a function that checks if an object has a property with the given name, but `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.bind(null)` is a bound function that always returns `false`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.apply(null)` is a function that checks if `null` has a property with the given
