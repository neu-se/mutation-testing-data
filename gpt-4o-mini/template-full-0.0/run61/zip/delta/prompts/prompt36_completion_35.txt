Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the condition to only allow the overwrite if `priority` is explicitly `true`, which is the opposite of the original logic that allows overwriting when `priority` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the overwrite when `priority` is anything other than `false`, including `true` or `undefined`, which would not match the original intent of only allowing overwriting when `priority` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an additional condition that checks if `a` is not `null`, which would prevent the overwrite if `a` is `null`, diverging from the original logic that only checks the `priority` flag.

DONE.
