  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method returns an array of the map's values, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>` would return a single value, which would cause the `map` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.values(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `values` method returns an array of the map's values, but the `<PLACEHOLDER>` would return a single value, which would cause the `map` method to fail.
