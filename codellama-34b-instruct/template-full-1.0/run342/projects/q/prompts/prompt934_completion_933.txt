  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context of the function to the promise object, whereas the original code fragment refers to the global object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null), args
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas the original code fragment uses the global object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.prototype, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Function prototype object, whereas the original code fragment uses the global object.

DONE.
