  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `bearing.toString()` returns a string representation of the bearing value, whereas `Number(bearing)` returns the numeric value of the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `bearing + 1` adds 1 to the bearing value, whereas `Number(bearing)` returns the numeric value of the bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `bearing * 2` multiplies the bearing value by 2, whereas `Number(bearing)` returns the numeric value of the bearing.

DONE.
