  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be multiplied by `a` instead of `b`, which is the intended variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be multiplied by `b + 1` instead of `b`, which would change the result of the multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the complex number to be multiplied by the mathematical constant pi (Ï€) instead of `b`, which would change the result of the multiplication.

DONE.
