  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while the replacement code fragment `cb(end, data)` is a function call with arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the replacement code fragment `cb(end, data + 1)` is a function call with an argument that is one greater than the original argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call with no arguments, while the replacement code fragment `cb(end, data * 2)` is a function call with an argument that is twice the original argument.

DONE.
