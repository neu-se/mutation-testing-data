  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!currentUrlStr.startsWith('http:')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would interpret the URL as relative instead of absolute, potentially leading to different URL parsing results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.includes('http:')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would interpret the URL as absolute instead of relative, potentially leading to different URL parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.indexOf('http://') !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse()` function would interpret the URL as relative instead of absolute, potentially leading to different URL parsing results.

DONE.
