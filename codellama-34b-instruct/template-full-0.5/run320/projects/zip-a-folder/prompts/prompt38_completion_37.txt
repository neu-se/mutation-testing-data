  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the code to enter the `else` block when the input is not a glob, and the `directory` method to be called instead of the `glob` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that is bound to the `null` context, which would cause the `isGlob` function to be called with the wrong `this` value, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method calls the `isGlob` function with the `null` context, which would cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value, potentially leading to errors
