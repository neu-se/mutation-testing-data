Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], ref[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `ref[2]` twice instead of `ref[3]`, which means the fourth argument is not passed correctly, potentially leading to unexpected results when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the fourth argument instead of the expected `ref[3]`, which could cause the function to behave incorrectly if it relies on that argument being a valid value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2], undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `undefined` as the fourth argument instead of `ref[3]`, which may lead to different handling of the argument in the subsequent logic of the `pull` function.

DONE.
