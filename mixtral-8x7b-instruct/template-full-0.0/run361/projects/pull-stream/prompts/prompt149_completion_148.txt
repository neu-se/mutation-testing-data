 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the object to a string before passing it to the `values` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object has a specific property, rather than passing all the keys of the object to the `values` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns a random value instead of passing the keys of the object to the `values` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
