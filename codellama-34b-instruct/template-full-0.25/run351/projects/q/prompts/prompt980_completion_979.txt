  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not called, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with `null` as an argument, which means that the promise will be resolved with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is called with a function that does not have any side effects, which means that the promise will not be resolved or rejected.

DONE.
