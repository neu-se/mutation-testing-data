  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that holds all the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with an empty array would cause a different behavior as it would not contain any of the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that holds all the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with a number like `123` would cause a different behavior as it would not contain any of the original arguments and would not be an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `arguments` object, which is a special object that holds all the arguments passed to a function. Replacing it with `null` would cause a different behavior as it would
