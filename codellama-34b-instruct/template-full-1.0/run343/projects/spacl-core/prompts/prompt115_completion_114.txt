  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, which means that the `for` loop would iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice()` removes elements from the array, which means that the `for` loop would iterate over a different array than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.push("new verb")
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds a new element to the array, which means that the `for` loop would iterate over a different array than the original code.

DONE.
