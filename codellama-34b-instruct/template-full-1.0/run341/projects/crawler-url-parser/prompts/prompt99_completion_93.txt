  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!urlMap.has
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator `!` would cause the conditional block to execute whenever the `urlMap` does not contain the current URL, even if it has already been extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.containsKey
```
This would result in different behavior because the `containsKey` method checks the existence of a key in the map, rather than checking the value of the `urlMap.has` property. This would cause the conditional block to execute whenever the `urlMap` contains a key for the current URL, even if it has already been extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.get(currentUrl.url) != true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method would return the stored value for the current URL, rather than returning the value of the `urlMap.has` property. This would cause the conditional block to execute whenever the stored value for
