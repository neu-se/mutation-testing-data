  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-90 * Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because negating the angle 90 degrees would cause the calculation to be Null and throw an exception if the angle is in the 2nd or 4th quadrant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because dividing by zero would cause the calculation to be NaN.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(90 * Math.PI) / Math.cos(90 * Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculations would swap the numerator and the denominator.

DONE.
