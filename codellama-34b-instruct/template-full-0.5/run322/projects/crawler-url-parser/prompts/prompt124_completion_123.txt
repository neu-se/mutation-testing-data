  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which is used to resolve relative URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which is used to resolve relative URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not take into account the `baseUrlStr` parameter, which is used to resolve relative URLs.

DONE.
