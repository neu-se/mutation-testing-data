  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the first element of the `attempt1` array instead of the second element, which is what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number(attempt1[2]) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add one to the value extracted from the `attempt1` array, which would change the line number that is extracted from the stack trace.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String(attempt1[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the value extracted from the `attempt1` array to a string, which would cause the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return a different result.

DONE.
