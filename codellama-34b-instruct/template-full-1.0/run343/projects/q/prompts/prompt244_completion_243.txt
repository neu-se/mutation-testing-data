  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of calling the `inspect` method on `resolvedPromise`, which is not what the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of calling the `promiseDispatch` method on `resolvedPromise`, which is not what the original code does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `promise` object, which is not what the original code does.

DONE.
