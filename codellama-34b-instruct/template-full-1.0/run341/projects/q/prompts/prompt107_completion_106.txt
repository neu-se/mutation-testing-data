  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++ < this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment `i` before checking the condition, which would cause the loop to terminate earlier than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the length of the array as a valid index, which would cause the loop to include an additional iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.length - i > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the length of the array minus the current index is greater than 0, which would cause the loop to terminate earlier than intended if the array is not empty.

DONE.
