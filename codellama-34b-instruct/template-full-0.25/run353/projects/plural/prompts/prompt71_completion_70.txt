  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cellos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal with a typo. The typo would cause the pluralization function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal with a different value. The pluralization function would return a different result for the replacement code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the replacement code fragment is a string literal with a different value. The pluralization function would return a different result for the replacement code fragment.

DONE.
