  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the first argument, regardless of the number of arguments passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return the last argument, regardless of the number of arguments passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would always return `undefined`, regardless of the number of arguments passed.

DONE.
