  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is a different element in the `rules` array than `rule[1]`, which is the element that is being checked in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the first element in the `rules` array, which is a regular expression that matches the input word, whereas `rule[1]` is the second element, which is a function that returns the plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1] + 1` is a different value than `rule[1]`, which is the value that is being checked in the code.

DONE.
