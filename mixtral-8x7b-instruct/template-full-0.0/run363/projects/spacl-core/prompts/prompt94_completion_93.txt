 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'random_string'
```
This would result in different behavior because a constant string is used instead of the policy name, causing incorrect policy lookups.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.random().toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because a random string is generated each time, causing inconsistent policy lookups and potential errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<Policy>{}).name
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty policy object is created and its name is accessed, which would throw a runtime error due to the missing name property.

DONE.
