  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the callback function. Instead, the callback function is being called with `end + 1`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it is expecting a specific value for `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the callback function. Instead, the callback function is being called with `end - 1`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it is expecting a specific value for `end`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is no longer being passed directly to the callback function. Instead, the callback function is being called with `end * 2`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it is expecting a specific value for `end
