  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path starts with a slash, while this replacement checks if the path contains any invalid characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains empty segments, while this replacement checks if the path contains consecutive slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(version === '1' || version === '1.0' ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/ : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains
