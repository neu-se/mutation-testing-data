  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport` is an array, and `atReport.length` would return the length of the array, which is not the same as the index of the element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport.pop()` would remove the last element from the `atReport` array, which is not the same as the element at the index `atReport`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `atReport.shift()` would remove the first element from the `atReport` array, which is not the same as the element at the index `atReport`.

DONE.
