  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called on the array returned by `slice()`, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, rather than reversing the order of the characters in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called with the `true` argument, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, but also remove any duplicate elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method is being called with the `false` argument, which would reverse the order of the elements in the array, but not remove any duplicate elements.

DONE.
