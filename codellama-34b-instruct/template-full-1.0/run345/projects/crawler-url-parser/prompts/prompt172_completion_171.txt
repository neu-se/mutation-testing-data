  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports.parse = parse;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `parse` function as a module export, which may not be intended and could potentially cause errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = { parse };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export an object with a `parse` property, whose value is the `parse` function. This may not be intended and could potentially cause errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
module.exports = parse;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would export the `parse` function directly, without any additional properties or functions. This may not be intended and could potentially cause errors.

DONE.
