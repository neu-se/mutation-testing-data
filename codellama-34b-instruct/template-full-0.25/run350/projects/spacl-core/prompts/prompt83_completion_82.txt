  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would cause the `matches` method to always return `false`, even if the `path` matches one of the rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx, path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx` and `path` values would be swapped, which could cause the `matches` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path, ctx.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ctx.path` value would be used instead of the `path` value, which could cause the `matches` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
