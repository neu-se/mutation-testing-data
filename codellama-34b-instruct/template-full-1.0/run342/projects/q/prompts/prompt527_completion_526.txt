  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return dispatch(void 0, op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`, which would cause the `dispatch` function to receive `undefined` as its first argument, which would likely cause it to behave differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return dispatch(op, args, void 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`, which would cause the `dispatch` function to receive `undefined` as its last argument, which would likely cause it to behave differently than the original code fragment.
