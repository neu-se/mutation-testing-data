  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the spread operator to copy the properties of the `tzs` object into the `prev` object, while the buggy code fragment uses the assignment operator to directly assign the `tzs[key]` value to the `prev` object. This would cause the `prev` object to contain a single property with the key `key` and the value `tzs[key]`, rather than the expected behavior of copying all properties of the `tzs` object into the `prev` object.
