  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is the logical NOT operator, which flips the truthiness of the value it is applied to. In this case, the `!test` expression would always return the opposite of the value returned by the `test` function, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is being used to call the `test` function with a different `this` value. In this case, the `this` value would be set to `null`, which could cause the `test` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being used to create a new function that is bound to the `null` value. In this case, the new function would always return the same value regardless of the
