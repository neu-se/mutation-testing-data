  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.doesNotExist
```
This would result in different behavior because `doesNotExist` is not a method of the `Policy` class, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method takes two arguments, `path` and `ctx`, but the original code fragment only passed one argument, `path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method takes two arguments, `path` and `ctx`, and the third argument is a boolean value that indicates whether the match should be exact. In the original code fragment, this argument was not provided, so it would default to `false`.

DONE.
