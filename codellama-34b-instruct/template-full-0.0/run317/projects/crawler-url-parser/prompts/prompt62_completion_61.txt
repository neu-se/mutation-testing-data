  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the path of the URL, which may not be the same as the original code fragment that returned the entire URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the host of the URL, which may not be the same as the original code fragment that returned the entire URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the protocol of the URL, which may not be the same as the original code fragment that returned the entire URL.

DONE.
