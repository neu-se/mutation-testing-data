Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` returns the nearest integer to the given number, which can lead to loss of precision when parsing floating-point numbers, unlike `parseFloat` which retains the decimal values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` converts the string to an integer, discarding any decimal part, which can lead to incorrect results when the input is a floating-point number, whereas `parseFloat` preserves the decimal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying the parsed value by 2 would change its magnitude, leading to incorrect results in the context of complex number calculations, while `parseFloat` simply converts the string to a number without altering its value.

DONE.
