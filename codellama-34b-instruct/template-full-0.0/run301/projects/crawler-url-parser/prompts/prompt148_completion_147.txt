  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash character to split the URL path into parts, while the new code fragment is using the backslash character. This would cause the URL path to be split differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the forward slash character to split the URL path into parts, while the new code fragment is using the backslash character. This would cause the URL path to be split differently, potentially leading to different results.
