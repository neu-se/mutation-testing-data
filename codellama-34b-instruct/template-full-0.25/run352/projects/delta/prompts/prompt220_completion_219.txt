  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code fragment only checks for null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!=` operator, which checks for both null and undefined, while the new code fragment only checks for undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== 'null'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for the presence of the string 'null', while the new code fragment checks for the presence of the string 'undefined'.

DONE.
