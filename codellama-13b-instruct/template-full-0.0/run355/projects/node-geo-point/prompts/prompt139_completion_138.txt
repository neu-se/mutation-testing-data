  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjust function is called with the longitude value instead of the latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjust function is called with the latitude value instead of the longitude value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude + this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the adjust function is called with the sum of the latitude and longitude values instead of either of them.

DONE.
