 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.hasNext() &&
  isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the previous operation in the current delta instead of the last operation in the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
  isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it only considers the case when the next operation in the other delta is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete' &&
  isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1], newOp)
