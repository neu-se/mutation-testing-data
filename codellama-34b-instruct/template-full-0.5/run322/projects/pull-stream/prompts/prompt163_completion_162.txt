  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` would always be truthy, even if the array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` would always be falsy, even if the array is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `array.length` would always be truthy, even if the array is empty.

DONE.
