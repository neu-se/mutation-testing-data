  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to `true` only if both iterators have a next value, whereas the original code fragment would check if either iterator has a next value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext() || !otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to `true` only if one or both iterators do not have a next value, whereas the original code fragment would check if either iterator has a next value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(thisIter.hasNext() && otherIter.hasNext())
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the condition to `true` only if neither iterator has a next value, whereas the original code fragment would check if either iterator has a next value.

DONE.
