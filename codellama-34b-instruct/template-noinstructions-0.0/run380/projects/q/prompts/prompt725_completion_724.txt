  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's state, while `promise.inspect.value` returns the value of the promise. If the promise is rejected, `promise.inspect.value` will return `undefined`, while `promise.inspect` will return a snapshot with the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.inspect.state` returns the state of the promise, while `promise.inspect` returns a snapshot of the promise's state. If the promise is rejected, `promise.inspect.state` will return "rejected", while `promise.inspect` will return a snapshot with the rejection reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect.isFulfilled
