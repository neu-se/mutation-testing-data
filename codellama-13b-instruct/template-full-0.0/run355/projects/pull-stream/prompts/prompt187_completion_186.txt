  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with `true` as the first argument, which would cause the test to pass.

DONE.
