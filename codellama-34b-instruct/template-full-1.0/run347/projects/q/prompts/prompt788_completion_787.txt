  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid object in JavaScript, and `object` is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid object in JavaScript, and `object` is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Promise()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Promise()` creates a new promise object, while `object` is not a promise object.

DONE.
