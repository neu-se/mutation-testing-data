  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(nearerValue) && nearerValue.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only shorten the chain if the `nearerValue` is a promise that has been fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nearerValue === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only shorten the chain if the `nearerValue` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nearerValue.valueOf() !== nearerValue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only shorten the chain if the `valueOf` method of the `nearerValue` returns a different value than the `nearerValue` itself.

DONE.
