  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a given value, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw exception
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a statement that throws an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a statement that returns a value from a function, whereas `reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a given reason.

DONE.
