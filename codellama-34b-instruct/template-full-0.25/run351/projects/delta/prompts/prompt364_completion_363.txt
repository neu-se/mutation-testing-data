  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if `otherIter` does not have any more elements, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if `otherIter` does not have any more elements, leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to continue even if `otherIter` does not have any more elements, leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
