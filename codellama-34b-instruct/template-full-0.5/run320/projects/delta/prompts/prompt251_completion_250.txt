  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the method to return a different value, leading to a different behavior in the `diff` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(other.ops[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the method to push a different operation onto the `delta` array, leading to a different behavior in the `diff` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(opLength)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is called with a different argument, which could cause the method to delete a different number of operations from the `retDelta` array, leading to a different behavior in the `diff` method.

DONE.
