  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterion'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criteria'`, which is the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'criterion'`, which is the singular form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criteria'`, which is the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'criterions'`, which is a made-up plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'criterions'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `'criteria'`, which is the plural form of the word, while the new code fragment is `'criterions'`, which is a made-up plural form of the word.

DONE.
