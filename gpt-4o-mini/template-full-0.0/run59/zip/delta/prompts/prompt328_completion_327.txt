Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the entire operation object to just the `insert` property, potentially leading to incorrect handling of operations that do not have an `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the operation being pushed to the inverted Delta from an insertion to a retention, which could lead to loss of data or incorrect state in the resulting Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a `null` value into the inverted Delta, which is likely not a valid operation and could cause errors or unexpected behavior when processing the Delta.

DONE.
