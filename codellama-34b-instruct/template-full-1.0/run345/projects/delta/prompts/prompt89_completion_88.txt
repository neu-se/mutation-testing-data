  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a particular class, whereas `typeof` checks the type of a variable. In this case, `newOp.attributes` is an object, but `typeof newOp.attributes` would return `'object'` regardless of whether it is an instance of `Object` or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getPrototypeOf(newOp.attributes) === Object.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the prototype of `newOp.attributes` is the same as the prototype of `Object`, whereas `typeof` checks the type of a variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(newOp.attributes) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the output of `Object.prototype.toString.call(newOp.
