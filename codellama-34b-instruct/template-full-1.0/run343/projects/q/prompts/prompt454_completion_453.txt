  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `+` operator is used to concatenate a string and an object, which results in a string. However, in the modified code, the `undefined` value is used, which would result in a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate a string and `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `+` operator is used to concatenate a string and an object, which results in a string. However, in the modified code, the `null` value is used, which would result in a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate a string and `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{toString: function() {return `" Error: " + reason`}}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `+` operator is used to concatenate a string and an object
