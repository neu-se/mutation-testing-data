  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(reject(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that resolves the promise with a new value, but `reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(fulfill(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that resolves the promise with a new value, but `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise with a value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
become(Q(value));
```
This would result in different behavior because `become` is a function that resolves the promise with a new value, but `Q` is a function that creates a new promise that is resolved with the given value.

DONE.
