  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` as is, while the modified code fragment uses the negative of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` as is, while the modified code fragment uses the value of `b` plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the value of `b` as is, while the modified code fragment uses the sine of `b`.

DONE.
