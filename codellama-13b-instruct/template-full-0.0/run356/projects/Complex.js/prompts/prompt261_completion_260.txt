  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is called with the `a` variable instead of the `b` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is called with the `b + 1` expression instead of the `b` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `logHypot` function is called with the `b * 2` expression instead of the `b` variable.

DONE.
