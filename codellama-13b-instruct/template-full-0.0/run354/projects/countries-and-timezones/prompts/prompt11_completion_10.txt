  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } });
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.assign` method to merge the `result` object with a new object, while this code uses the `Object.assign` method to merge the `result` object with an empty object. This could potentially cause issues if the `result` object is not empty and contains properties that are not intended to be overwritten.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country] = { current: [], all: [] };
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Object.assign` method to merge the `result` object with a new object, while this code directly assigns a new object to the `result[country]` property. This could potentially cause issues if the `result` object is not empty and contains properties that are not intended to be overwritten.
