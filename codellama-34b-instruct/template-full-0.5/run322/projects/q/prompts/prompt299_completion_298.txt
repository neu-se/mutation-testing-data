  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `x`, while this modified code fragment returns the value of `x + 1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `x`, while this modified code fragment returns the value of `y`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value of `x`, while this modified code fragment returns the value of `x * y`.

DONE.
