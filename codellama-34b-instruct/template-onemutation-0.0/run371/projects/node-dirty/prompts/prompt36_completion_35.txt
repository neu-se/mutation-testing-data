  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [val, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the key and value are swapped, which would cause the `forEach` method to iterate over the values instead of the keys, and the `get` method to return the value associated with the key instead of the key itself.

DONE.
