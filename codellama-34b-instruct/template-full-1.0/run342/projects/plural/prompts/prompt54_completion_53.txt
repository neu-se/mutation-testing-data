  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace('ves', 'eez')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced word "ves" would get replaced with "eez" instead of the intended "ies".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves/, 'eez')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced string "ves" would get replaced with "eez" instead of the intended "ies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves/, 'bb')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced string "ves" would get replaced with "bb" instead of the intended "ies".

DONE.
