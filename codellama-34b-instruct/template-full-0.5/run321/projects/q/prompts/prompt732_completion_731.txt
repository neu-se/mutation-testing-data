  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be negative, which would mean that there are more promises resolved than there are promises in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be equal to the number of promises in the array, which would mean that all promises have been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pendingCount` would be greater than 0, which would mean that there are still promises that have not been resolved.

DONE.
