  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `data` variable is not used in the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is not defined in the current scope, and the `end` variable is not used in the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value is not used in the function, and the `end` variable is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
