 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned Complex object would have a zero value for the imaginary part, instead of using the original value of `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the current Complex object, instead of the original value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1 for the imaginary part, instead of using the original value of `a`.

DONE.
