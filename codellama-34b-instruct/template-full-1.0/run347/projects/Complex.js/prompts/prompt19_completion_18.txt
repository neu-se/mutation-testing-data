  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y+4
```
This would result in different behavior because the constant 4 is added to the value of `y`, which could change the result of the expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the value of `y` would be changed, which could affect the outcome of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y*2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `y` would be multiplied by 2, which could change the resulting value.

DONE.
