  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the first argument to `dispatch` would cause the function to throw an error, whereas passing `object` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the first argument to `dispatch` would cause the function to throw an error, whereas passing `object` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an object as the first argument to `dispatch` would cause the function to return a promise that resolves to the object, whereas passing `object` would not.

DONE.
