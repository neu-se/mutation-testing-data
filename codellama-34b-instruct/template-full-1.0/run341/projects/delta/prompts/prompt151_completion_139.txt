  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a positive integer representing the number of characters to retain, and `firstLeft` is a positive integer representing the number of characters to retain. Adding them together would result in a value that is larger than the actual number of characters to retain, leading to incorrect cursor positioning and other issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a positive integer representing the number of characters to retain, and subtracting 1 from it would result in a value that is less than the actual number of characters to retain, leading to incorrect cursor positioning and other issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a positive integer representing the number of characters to retain, and multiplying it by 0 would
