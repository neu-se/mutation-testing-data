  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the `newOp` object, which is a new object created by the `cloneDeep` function. This would cause the `insert` method to be called on a different object than the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the `this.ops[index - 1]` object, which is the object at the previous index in the `this.ops` array. This would cause the `insert` method to be called on a different object than the original code, which could result in different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the `this.ops[index]` object, which is
