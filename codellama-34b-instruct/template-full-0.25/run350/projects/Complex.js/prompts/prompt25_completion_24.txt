  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `-` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `-` operator and the order of operations is different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * (1 - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator, while this replacement uses the `-` operator and the order of operations is different.

DONE.
