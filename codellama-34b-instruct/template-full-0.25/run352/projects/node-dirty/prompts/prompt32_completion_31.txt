  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the key value by 1, which could cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the key value to uppercase, which could cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the key value, which could cause the `set` method to store the value at a different key than intended.

DONE.
