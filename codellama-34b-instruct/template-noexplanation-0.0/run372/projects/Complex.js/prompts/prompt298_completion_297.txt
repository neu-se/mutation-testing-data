  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This will negate the value of `b`, which is the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This will add 1 to the value of `b`, which will change the result of the `sinh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This will double the value of `b`, which will change the result of the `sinh` function.

DONE.
