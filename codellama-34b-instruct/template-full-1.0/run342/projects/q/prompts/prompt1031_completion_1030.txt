  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a defined value in JavaScript, whereas `null` is a defined value that represents the absence of any object value. Using `undefined` instead of `null` may cause the `nodeback` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a defined value in JavaScript that represents a truthy value, whereas `null` is a defined value that represents the absence of any object value. Using `true` instead of `null` may cause the `nodeback` function to behave differently, potentially leading to errors in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a defined value in JavaScript that represents a falsy value, whereas `null` is a defined value that represents the absence of any object value
