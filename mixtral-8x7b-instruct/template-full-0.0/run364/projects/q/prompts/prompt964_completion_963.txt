 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the global object, which may not be the same as `this` in the original context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically refers to the `window` object, which is only available in browser environments, not Node.js environments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `null`, which is not the same as the original `this` value.

DONE.
