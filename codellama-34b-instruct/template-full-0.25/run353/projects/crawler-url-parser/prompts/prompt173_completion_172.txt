  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the message to the console with an error level, while `console.log` would log the message with a log level.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.warn
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.warn` would log the message to the console with a warning level, while `console.log` would log the message with a log level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.info
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log the message to the console with an info level, while `console.log` would log the message with a log level.

DONE.
