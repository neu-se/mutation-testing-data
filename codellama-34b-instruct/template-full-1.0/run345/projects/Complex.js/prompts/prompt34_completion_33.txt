  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, and replacing it with `b` would result in the complex conjugate of the original number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, and replacing it with `b` would result in only the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, and replacing it with `b` would result in only the imaginary part.

DONE.
