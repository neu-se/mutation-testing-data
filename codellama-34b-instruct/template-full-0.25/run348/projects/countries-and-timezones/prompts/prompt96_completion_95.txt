  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value that is the result of combining all the elements in the array using a provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
values.find
```
This would result in different behavior because `find` returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

DONE.
