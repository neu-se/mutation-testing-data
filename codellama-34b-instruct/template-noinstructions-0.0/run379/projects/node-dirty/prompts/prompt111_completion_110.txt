  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the entire buffer, while this new code fragment only includes the buffer up to the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the entire buffer, while this new code fragment only includes the buffer starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.replace(/\n/g, '')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the newline characters in the buffer, while this new code fragment replaces them with an empty string.

DONE.
