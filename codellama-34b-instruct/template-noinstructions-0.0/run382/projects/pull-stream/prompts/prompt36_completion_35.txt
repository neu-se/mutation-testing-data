  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[3]` element is not the same as the `ref[2]` element, which is the one that is being used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[1]` element is not the same as the `ref[2]` element, which is the one that is being used in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ref[0]` element is not the same as the `ref[2]` element, which is the one that is being used in the original code.

DONE.
