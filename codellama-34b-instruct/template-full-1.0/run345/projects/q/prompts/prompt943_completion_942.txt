  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the existing code fragment was missing the parentheses and the function call operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function name is different, and this code would attempt to call a function named `deferred` instead of `defer`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the existing code fragment was missing the qualifier `Q.` and the function call operator.

DONE.
