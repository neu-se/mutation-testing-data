  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tar function to use a lower compression level than the default.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tar function to use a higher compression level than the default.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression !== COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tar function to use a different compression level than the default, depending on the value of `o.compression`.

DONE.
