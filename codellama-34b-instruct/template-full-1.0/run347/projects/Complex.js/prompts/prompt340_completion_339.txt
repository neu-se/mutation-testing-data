  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == 0 & b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the & operator performs a bitwise AND, while the && operator performs a logical AND. In this case, using a bitwise AND would produce a different result in certain cases, such as when `a` and `b` are both non-zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0 || b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the || operator performs a logical OR, while the && operator performs a logical AND. In this case, using a logical OR would produce a different result in certain cases, such as when `a` or `b` is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the !== operator performs a strict inequality check, while the == operator performs a loose equality check. In this case, using a strict inequality check would produce a different result
