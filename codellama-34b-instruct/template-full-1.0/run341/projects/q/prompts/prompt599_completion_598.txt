  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is passed as the second argument to `Q.async`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a certain number of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invalid"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string is passed as the second argument to `Q.async`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a certain type of argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is passed as the second argument to `Q.async`, which could cause the function to behave differently if it expects a non-null value.

DONE.
