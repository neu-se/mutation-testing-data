  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `Q.defer` would be `undefined` instead of a promise, which is what the user would expect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `Q.defer` would be `null` instead of a promise, which is what the user would expect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the return value of `Q.defer` would be an error object instead of a promise, which is what the user would expect.

DONE.
