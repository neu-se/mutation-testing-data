 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.win32.join
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Windows-style path joining method, which may not work as expected on non-Windows systems.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(options.dest, decodedBasename) => path.join(options.dest, decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function to define a new function for joining the paths, which may not behave the same as the original `path.join` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'/'.concat(options.dest, decodedBasename)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses string concatenation to join the paths, which may not handle path normalization and other edge cases as well as the original `path.join` method.

DONE.
