Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the next operation without advancing the iterator, potentially causing the same operation to be processed multiple times instead of moving to the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the iterator to skip one operation regardless of the actual length of the operation, which could lead to incorrect transformations if the next operation is longer than one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively does nothing and does not advance the iterator, leading to an infinite loop or repeated processing of the same operation, which could cause unexpected results in the transformation logic.

DONE.
