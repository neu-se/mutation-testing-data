  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memo')
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of 'memo' would be the same as the singular form, which is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of 'memo' would be 'memos', which is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos', 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the plural form of 'memo' would be 'memos', which is not correct.

DONE.
