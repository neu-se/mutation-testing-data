  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which would cause the `insert()` method to insert the new op at the beginning of the array instead of the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element from the array, which would cause the `insert()` method to insert the new op at the beginning of the array instead of the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element from the array, which would cause the `insert()` method to insert the new op at the beginning of the array instead of the end.

DONE.
