Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends an extra 's' to the plural form, resulting in incorrect pluralization for words that already end in 'es'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the word before appending 'es', which would incorrectly pluralize words like "bus" to "buses" as "bus" instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it simply adds 's' instead of 'es', leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "box" which should become "boxes" but would incorrectly become "boxs".
