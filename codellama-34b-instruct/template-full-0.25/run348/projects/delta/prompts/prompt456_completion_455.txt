  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the `ops` array, causing the `rest()` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the last element of the `ops` array twice, causing the `rest()` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `rest()` method to return a different result, as the multiplication would change the value of `this.index`.

DONE.
