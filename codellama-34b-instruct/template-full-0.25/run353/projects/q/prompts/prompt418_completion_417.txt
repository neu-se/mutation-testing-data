  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `state` property that can be either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`, but not both. If the `state` property is `"rejected"`, the `value` property will be undefined, which would cause the `then` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns an object with a `state` property that can be either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`, but not both. If the `state` property is `"fulfilled"`, the `value` property will be defined, which would cause the `then` method to return a promise that is already resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "pending"
```
