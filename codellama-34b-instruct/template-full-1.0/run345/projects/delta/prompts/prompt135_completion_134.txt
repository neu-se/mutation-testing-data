  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method returns the length of the peeked element, which may not be the same as the peeked element itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next element in the iteration, which may not be the same as the peeked element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method returns a boolean value indicating whether there are more elements in the iteration, which may not be the same as the peeked element.

DONE.
