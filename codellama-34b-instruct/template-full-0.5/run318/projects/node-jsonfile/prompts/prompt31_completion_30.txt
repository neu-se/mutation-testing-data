  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a `null` value as the second argument, which would cause it to return a string representation of `null` instead of the expected `options` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive an `undefined` value as the second argument, which would cause it to return a string representation of `undefined` instead of the expected `options` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stringify` function would receive a `0` value as the second argument, which would cause it to return a string representation of `0` instead of the expected `options` object.

DONE.
