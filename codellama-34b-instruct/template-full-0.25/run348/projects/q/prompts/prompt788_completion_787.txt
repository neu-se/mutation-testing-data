  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `null` would be a falsy value, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a value, but `undefined` would be a falsy value, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a truthy value, but `false` is a falsy value, which could cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
