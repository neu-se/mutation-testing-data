  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.allSettled` is a different function from `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for an array of states (as returned by `inspect`) when all promises have settled, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a different function from `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for an array of values when all promises have resolved, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.any` is a different function from `allResolved`, and it returns a promise for the first resolved promise of an array, whereas `allResolved` returns a promise for an array of promises.
