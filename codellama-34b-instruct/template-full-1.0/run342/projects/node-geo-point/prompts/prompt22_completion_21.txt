  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the object has the properties 'latitude' and 'longitude', but this new code also checks if the properties contain actual values. If the object has no values for those properties, it will throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== undefined && object.longitude !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the object has the properties 'latitude' and 'longitude', but this new code also checks if the properties have been defined. If the property is defined but has no value, it will return true, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude !== null && object.longitude !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if the object has the
