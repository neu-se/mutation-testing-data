  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` variable to be decremented by 1, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` variable to be incremented by 1, potentially leading to an infinite loop or incorrect results in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `opLength` variable to be doubled, potentially leading to an incorrect result or infinite loop in the surrounding code.

DONE.
