  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` always returns a new array, even if no arguments are passed. In this case, it would create a shallow copy of `this.rules` instead of using the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` always returns a new array, even if no arguments are passed. In this case, it would create a new, empty array instead of using the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and `[]` does not have a `matches` method. In this case, it would raise a `TypeError` when ` matches` is called on `[]`.

DONE.
