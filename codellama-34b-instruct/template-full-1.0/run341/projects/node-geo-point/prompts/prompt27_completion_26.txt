  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculations for `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` would be using different latitude values, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculations for `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` would be using different longitude values, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(point1.latitude, point2.latitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculations for `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` would be using the maximum latitude value instead of the actual latitude value, which could lead to incorrect results.

DONE.
