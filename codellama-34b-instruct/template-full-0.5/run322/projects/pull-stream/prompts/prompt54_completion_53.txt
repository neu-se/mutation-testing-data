  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(read)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on the `s` object with the `read` argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(s.source)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on the `s` object with the `source` property of the `s` object as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `sink` method on the `s` object with `null` as an argument, which is not the intended behavior of the original code fragment.

DONE.
