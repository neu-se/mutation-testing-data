  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `val == null` would also match `null` and `undefined`, whereas `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `val !== undefined` would match any value that is not `undefined`, whereas `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof val === 'undefined'` would match any value that is of type `undefined`, whereas `val === undefined` only matches the value `undefined`.

DONE.
