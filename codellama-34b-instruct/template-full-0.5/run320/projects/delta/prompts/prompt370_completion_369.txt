  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the characters in the delta, whereas `delta.retain` would keep them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.insert` would insert new characters into the delta, whereas `delta.retain` would keep the existing characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { 'bold': true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the characters in the delta with the attribute 'bold' set to true, whereas the original code would retain the characters without any attributes.

DONE.
