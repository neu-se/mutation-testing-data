  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `Number.isFinite`, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true`, even if the input is a finite number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if the input is `NaN`, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if the input is a finite number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if the input is a safe integer, whereas `Number.isFinite` checks if the input is a finite number.

DONE.
