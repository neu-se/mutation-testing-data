  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator is used instead of the unary minus operator, which would cause the imaginary part of the complex number to be added instead of subtracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is multiplied by 2, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1] / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is divided by 2, which would cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude.

DONE.
