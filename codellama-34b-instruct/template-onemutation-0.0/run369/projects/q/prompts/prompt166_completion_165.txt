  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i++
```
This would result in different behavior because the prefix increment operator `++i` increments the value of `i` and then returns the original value, while the postfix increment operator `i++` returns the original value and then increments the value of `i`. In this case, the original code fragment uses the postfix increment operator, so the replaced code fragment would have different behavior.

DONE.
