  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `pull` function is now `ref[1]` instead of `ref[0]`. This change would cause the function to return a different value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the code that uses this function.

DONE.
