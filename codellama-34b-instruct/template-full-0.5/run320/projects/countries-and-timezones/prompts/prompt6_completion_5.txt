  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[a]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the alias `a` instead of the current timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[a] || data.timezones[c]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the alias `a` if it exists, otherwise it would return the timezone object with the alias `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.timezones[a].current
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current timezone object with the alias `a` instead of the current timezone object.

DONE.
