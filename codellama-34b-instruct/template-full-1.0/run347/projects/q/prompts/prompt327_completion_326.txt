  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument passed to the `when` method, which could potentially affect the Promise's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push(42)
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional argument to the `when` method, which could potentially cause the Promise to reject or resolve in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delete args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the first argument from the `when` method, which could potentially cause the Promise to reject or resolve in a different way.

DONE.
