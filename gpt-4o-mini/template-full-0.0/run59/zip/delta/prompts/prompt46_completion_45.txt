Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(b)` returns an array of the values of the properties of `b`, which may not match the expected embed type, leading to incorrect error messages or logic flow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the second key of `b`, which may not exist, potentially causing an `undefined` value to be compared with `embedType`, leading to unexpected errors or mismatches.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknownType'
```
This would result in different behavior because it hardcodes the embed type to a string `'unknownType'`, which will always fail the type check against `Object.keys(b)[0]`, resulting in an error regardless of the actual embed type present in `a` and `b`.

DONE.
