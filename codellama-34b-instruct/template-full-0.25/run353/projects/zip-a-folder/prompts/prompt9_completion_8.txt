  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function returns `true` if the input is a glob pattern, and `false` otherwise. Replacing `!isGlob(src)` with `isGlob(src)` would cause the code to enter the `if` block when `src` is a glob pattern, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.includes('*')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `includes` method checks if a string contains a specific substring. If `src` contains an asterisk, the code would enter the `if` block, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.match(/[*]/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method checks if a string matches a regular expression. If `src` matches the regular expression `/[*]/`,
