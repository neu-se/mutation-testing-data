  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURI
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURI` only decodes the URI's escape sequences and does not replace any characters, whereas `decodeURIComponent` decodes the URI's escape sequences and replaces any characters that are not legal in a URI.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(basename)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `basename` variable, which is a string, whereas `decodeURI` is called on the `pathname` variable, which is a URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodeURIComponent(pathname)
```
This would result in different behavior because `decodeURIComponent` is called on the `pathname` variable, which is a URL object, whereas `decodeURI` is called on the `basename` variable, which is a string.

DONE.
