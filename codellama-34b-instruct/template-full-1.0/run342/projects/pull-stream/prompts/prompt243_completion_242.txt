  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `abort` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `abort` is falsy, while the new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort.value() === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only checks if `abort` is truthy, while the new code fragment checks if the return value of the `abort.value()` method is strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
