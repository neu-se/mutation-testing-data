  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh(a)` is the hyperbolic sine of `a`, which is not the same as `sin(b)` which is the sine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cosh(b)` is the hyperbolic cosine of `b`, which is not the same as `cos(b)` which is the cosine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(b)` is the hyperbolic tangent of `b`, which is not the same as `tan(b)` which is the tangent of `b`.

DONE.
