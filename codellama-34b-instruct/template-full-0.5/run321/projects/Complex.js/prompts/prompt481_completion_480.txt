  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() && this['im'] === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks if `this['im']` is 0, but this new code also checks if `this['isInfinite']()` is true. This means that if the complex number is not at the infinity pole, the new code will not return `true` even if `this['im']` is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite']() || this['im'] === 0) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this['im']` is 0, but this new code checks if `this['isInfinite']()` is true. This means that if the complex number is not at the infinity pole, the new code will return `true` even if `this['im']` is not 0.
