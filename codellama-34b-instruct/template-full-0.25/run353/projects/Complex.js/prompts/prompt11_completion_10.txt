  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and values, which would affect the calculation of `cosh` and `sinh`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.exp` have different ranges and values, which would affect the calculation of `cosh` and `sinh`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant value, and using it instead of `Math.exp` would cause the calculation of `cosh` and `sinh` to be incorrect.

DONE.
