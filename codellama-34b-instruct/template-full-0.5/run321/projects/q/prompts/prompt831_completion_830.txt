  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined` instead of `fulfilled`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved with the value `null` instead of `fulfilled`.

DONE.
