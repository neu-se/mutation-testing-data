  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments` is a special object in JavaScript that contains the arguments passed to a function, but `arguments[0]` would only contain the first argument passed to the function, which may not be the same as `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[1]` would contain the second argument passed to the function, which may not be the same as `thisp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `arguments[2]` would contain the third argument passed to the function, which may not be the same as `thisp`.

DONE.
