  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit an error instead of loading the data from the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit a `drain` event instead of loading the data from the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `write_close` event would be emitted instead of the `load` event, which would cause the `Dirty` instance to emit a `write_close` event instead of loading the data from the file.

DONE.
