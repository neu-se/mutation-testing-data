  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the base URL from HTTP to HTTPS, which could potentially cause issues with the parsing and normalization of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the base URL, which could potentially cause issues with the parsing and normalization of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "ftp://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the base URL from HTTP to FTP, which could potentially cause issues with the parsing and normalization of the URL.

DONE.
