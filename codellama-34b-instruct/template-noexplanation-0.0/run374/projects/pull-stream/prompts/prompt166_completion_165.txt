  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not a function and will likely cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is not a function and will likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This change will cause the `abortCb` function to be called with an empty function as the first argument, which will not cause an error but may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
