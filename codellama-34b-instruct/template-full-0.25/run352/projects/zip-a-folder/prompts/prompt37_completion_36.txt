  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of whether `src` is a glob or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of whether `src` is a glob or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of whether `src` is a glob or not.

DONE.
