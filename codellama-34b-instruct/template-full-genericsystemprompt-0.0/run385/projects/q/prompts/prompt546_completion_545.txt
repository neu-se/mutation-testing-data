  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is a value that is passed to the `next` method of the generator, while `null` is a value that is not passed to the `next` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is a value that is passed to the `next` method of the generator, while `undefined` is a value that is not passed to the `next` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `arg` is a value that is passed to the `next` method of the generator, while `0` is a value that is not passed to the `next` method.

DONE.
