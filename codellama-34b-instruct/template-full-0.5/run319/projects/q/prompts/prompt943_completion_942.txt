  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not called with the correct context, which is necessary for it to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.resolve` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.reject` is not a function, so it would throw an error when called.

DONE.
