  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = thisOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the embed from the original `thisOp.retain` to a constant `embedType`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = otherOp.retain;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the embed from the original `thisOp.retain` to `otherOp.retain`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const embedType = thisOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the embed from the original `thisOp.retain` to `thisOp.insert`, which could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original type.

DONE.
