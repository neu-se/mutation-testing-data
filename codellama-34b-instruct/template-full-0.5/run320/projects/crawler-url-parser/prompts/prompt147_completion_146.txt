  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("/")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the delimiter, while this replacement code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the delimiter and then filters out any empty strings from the resulting array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("\\")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "/" character as the delimiter, while this replacement code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an array of substrings using the "\\" character as the delimiter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the linkurl_path string into an
