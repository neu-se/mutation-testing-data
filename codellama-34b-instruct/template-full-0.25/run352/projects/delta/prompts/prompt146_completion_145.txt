  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by one element, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(thisIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the length of the current operation, potentially skipping over multiple operations in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator over the other delta by one element, potentially skipping over the next operation in the delta.

DONE.
