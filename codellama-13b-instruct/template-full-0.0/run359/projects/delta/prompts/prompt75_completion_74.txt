  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cloneDeep` function is used to create a deep copy of the `newOp` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Object.assign` method to create a shallow copy. This could potentially cause issues if the `newOp` object contains nested objects or arrays, as the `cloneDeep` function would create a separate copy of each nested object or array, whereas the `Object.assign` method would only create a shallow copy of the nested objects or arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.assign` method is used to create a shallow copy of the `newOp` object, whereas the original code fragment uses the `cloneDeep` function to create a deep copy. This could potentially cause issues if the `newOp` object contains nested objects or arrays, as the `Object.assign` method would only create a shallow copy of the nested
