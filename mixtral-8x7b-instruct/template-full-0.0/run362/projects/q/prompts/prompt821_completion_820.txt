 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` function would always return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, instead of handling the rejections and progress notifications of the original promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.when(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when` treats its argument as a promise, and returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the argument if it is not a promise, or follows the promise if it is a promise. In this case, it would always return a resolved promise with a value of `null`, instead of handling the rejections and progress notifications of the original promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a promise that is resolved with the given value, ignoring any progress notifications and rejections. In this
