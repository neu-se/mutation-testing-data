  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called for each promise in the array, regardless of whether the promise was fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called for each promise in the array, but the callback would do nothing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected, function(progress) { return progress; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onProgress` callback to be called for each promise in the array, and the callback would return the progress value.

DONE.
