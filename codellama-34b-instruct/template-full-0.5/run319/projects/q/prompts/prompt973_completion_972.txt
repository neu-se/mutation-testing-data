  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` returns the `Q` object, while the new code fragment `0` returns the number 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Q"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` returns the `Q` object, while the new code fragment `"Q"` returns the string "Q".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` returns the `Q` object, while the new code fragment `null` returns null.

DONE.
