  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`emit'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would eliminate the usage of `this` and instead use a global `emit` function, which might not be defined or have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`error(err)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `error` function immediately, instead of passing it as a callback to the `write` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`this._emit(err)`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a different function, `_emit`, instead of `emit`, which might have a different implementation or behavior.

DONE.
