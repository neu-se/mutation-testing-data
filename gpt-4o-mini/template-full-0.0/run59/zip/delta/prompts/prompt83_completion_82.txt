Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes !== lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for reference equality instead of deep equality, which means it would return `true` even if the objects have the same properties and values but are different instances.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(newOp.attributes, lastOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it negates the equality check, causing the condition to pass when the attributes are not equal, which would lead to incorrect merging of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes == lastOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses loose equality (`==`) instead of strict equality (`===`), which can lead to unexpected results when comparing attributes that may be of different types but have equivalent values.

DONE.
