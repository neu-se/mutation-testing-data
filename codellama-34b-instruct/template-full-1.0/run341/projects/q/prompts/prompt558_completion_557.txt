  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on the string "string" instead of the generator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on null instead of the generator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `next()` method on undefined instead of the generator.

DONE.
