  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would return the value of the `read` variable, but replacing it with `null` would return `null` instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would return the value of the `read` variable, but replacing it with `undefined` would return `undefined` instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `read` would return the value of the `read` variable, but replacing it with `0` would return `0` instead.

DONE.
