  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'b'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting to extract links from the `a` tag, but with the replacement code, it would extract links from the `b` tag instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting to extract links from the `a` tag, but with the replacement code, it would extract links from the `a` tag that has an `href` attribute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a[href^="http"]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code is expecting to extract links from the `a` tag, but with the replacement code, it would extract links from the `a` tag that has an `href` attribute starting with "http".

DONE.
