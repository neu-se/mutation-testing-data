  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to `array_slice` would be different, potentially causing the function to return a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice(1)` would return a different array than `array_slice(arguments, 1)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].slice.call(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array, and `slice` is called on it with the `arguments` object as the `this` value, effectively returning a copy of the `arguments` object without the first element.

DONE.
