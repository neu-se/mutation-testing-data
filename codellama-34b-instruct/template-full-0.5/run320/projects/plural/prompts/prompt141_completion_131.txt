  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second element of the rule array is the replacement string, not the match pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because there is no third element in the rule array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, "xyz"
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is always "xyz", regardless of the input word or rule.

DONE.
