  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = 1
```
This change will cause the `min` variable to always be set to 1, regardless of the input. This will result in the `compile` function always returning a regular expression that matches at least one character, even if the input is an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = 0
```
This change will cause the `max` variable to always be set to 0, regardless of the input. This will result in the `compile` function always returning a regular expression that matches an empty string, even if the input is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push('')
```
This change will cause the `parts` array to always contain an empty string, regardless of the input. This will result in the `compile` function always returning a regular expression that matches an empty string, even if the input is not empty.

DONE.
