  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would not pass the array of arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, [args]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array of arguments is wrapped in an additional array, which would cause the function to receive a single argument that is an array of the original arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [void 0, args.slice()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array of arguments is sliced, which would cause the function to receive a copy of the original array of arguments, rather than the original array.

DONE.
