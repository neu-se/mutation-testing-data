  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the `emit` method is called immediately, rather than being called after the `drain` event is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('drain'));
```
This would result in different behavior because an error event is emitted with the message "drain", rather than the `drain` event being emitted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._data.size);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` event is emitted with the number of items in the `_data` map, rather than being emitted without any arguments.

DONE.
