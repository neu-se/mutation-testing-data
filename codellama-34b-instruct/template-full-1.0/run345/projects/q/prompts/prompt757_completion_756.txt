  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves when all promises in the array are fulfilled or rejected, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that only resolves when all promises in the array are rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"none"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves when all promises in the array are fulfilled or rejected, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that only resolves when none of the promises in the array are fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves when all promises in the array are fulfilled or rejected, while the modified code fragment returns a promise that only resolves when any of the promises in the array are rejected.

DONE.
