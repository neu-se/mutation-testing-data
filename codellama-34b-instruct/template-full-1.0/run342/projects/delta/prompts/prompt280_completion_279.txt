  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `insert` method, potentially causing the resulting delta to have a different length or composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp
```
This would result in the same behavior as the original code, because the `insert` method is called with the same value as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `otherOp` to the `insert` method, potentially causing the resulting delta to have a different length or composition.

DONE.
