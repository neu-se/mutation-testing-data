  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and would create a type mismatch.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"", value
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string is not the same as `null`, and would create a type mismatch.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is not the same as `null`, and would create a type mismatch.

DONE.
