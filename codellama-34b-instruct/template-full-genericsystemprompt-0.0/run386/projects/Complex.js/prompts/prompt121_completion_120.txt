  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `this['isInfinite']`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the divisor is real, even if the dividend is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isFinite']` would evaluate to `true` if the dividend is finite, even if the divisor is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isNaN']` would evaluate to `true` if the dividend is NaN, even if the divisor is infinite.

DONE.
