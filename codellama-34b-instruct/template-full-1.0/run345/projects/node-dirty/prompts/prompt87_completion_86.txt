  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `pop` method removes the last element from the array, while the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array. This change would cause the test to fail because the test expects the last element to be removed, not the first element to be moved to the end of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.reverse().pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `pop` method removes the last element from the array, while the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array. This change would cause the test to succeed because the `reverse` method moves the last element to the first position, so the `pop` method would remove the first element instead of the last one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code
