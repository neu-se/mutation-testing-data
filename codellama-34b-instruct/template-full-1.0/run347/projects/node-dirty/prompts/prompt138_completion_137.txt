  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.size` is a number and `key` is a string, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.get(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.get(null)` would return `undefined` instead of a string, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.keys.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data.keys.length` is a number and `key` is a string, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to throw an error.

DONE.
