 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect() === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `inspect()` method returns `undefined`, instead of checking if `resolvedPromise` is not defined. This might cause the condition to be true even after the promise is resolved or rejected, leading to different behavior in the code that follows this line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks the type of `resolvedPromise` to be `'undefined'`, instead of just checking if it is not defined. This might cause the condition to be true even after the promise is resolved or rejected, leading to different behavior in the code that follows this line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `inspect()` method and checks the `state` property of the returned object, instead of checking if
