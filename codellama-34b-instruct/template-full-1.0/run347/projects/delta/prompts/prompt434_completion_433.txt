  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be pointing to the previous operation instead of the current one, which could cause the iteration to skip an operation or return the wrong operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be pointing to the next operation instead of the current one, which could cause the iteration to skip an operation or return the wrong operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the iterator would be pointing to the length of the operations array instead of the current operation, which could cause the iteration to skip an operation or return the wrong operation.

DONE.
