  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use the `longitude` property instead of the `latitude` property to construct the `GeoPoint` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use a different value for the `latitude` property, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would use a different value for the `longitude` property, which would affect the calculation of the distance and bearing.

DONE.
