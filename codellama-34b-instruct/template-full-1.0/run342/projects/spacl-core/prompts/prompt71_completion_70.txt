  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the ! operator negates the truth value of the expression, so if `verb` is a truthy value, the original code would return `true`, but with the replacement, it would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the + operator would add the value 1 to `verb`, which would change the truth value of the expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verb && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the && operator checks if both operands are truthy values, and if the left operand is falsy, the right operand would not be evaluated, so if `verb` is falsy, the original code would return `false`, but with the replacement, it would return `true`.

DONE.
