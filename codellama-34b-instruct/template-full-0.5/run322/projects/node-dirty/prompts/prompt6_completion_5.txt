  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key-value pair from the `Map`, whereas the original code fragment would update the value associated with the key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the value associated with the key would be incremented by 1, whereas the original code fragment would update the value to the new value provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the value associated with the key would be multiplied by 2, whereas the original code fragment would update the value to the new value provided.

DONE.
