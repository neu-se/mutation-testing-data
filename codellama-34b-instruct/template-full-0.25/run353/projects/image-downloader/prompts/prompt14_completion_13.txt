  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
basename.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable as-is, while the new code fragment converts it to lowercase. This could cause the `path.join()` function to produce a different output, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `request()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `basename` variable to get the file name, while the new code fragment uses `path.dirname()` to get the directory name. This could cause the `path.join()` function to produce a different output, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `request()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest, path.extname(options.dest))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `bas
