  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || 1
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the value `1` instead of `0` as the default value for `places` when it is not provided. This change will cause the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods to always round to the nearest integer, even when `places` is not specified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Infinity
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the value `Infinity` instead of `0` as the default value for `places` when it is not provided. This change will cause the `ceil`, `floor`, and `round` methods to always round to the nearest integer, even when `places` is not specified.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10, places || Math.PI
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the value `
