  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to always return the `id` function, rather than the `mapper` function. This would break the functionality of the `map` function, as it would no longer map the data using the provided mapper function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to always return a function that returns `null`, rather than the `mapper` function. This would break the functionality of the `map` function, as it would no longer map the data using the provided mapper function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop(mapper) == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to always return a function that returns `null`, rather than the `mapper` function. This would break the functionality of the `map` function,
