  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, unlike `object`, which is an object. In the original code, `object_hasOwnProperty` is called with `object` as the `this` value, which is necessary for the function to work correctly. If `null` is used instead, the function will throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `hasOwnProperty` method on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, unlike `object`, which is an object. In the original code, `object_hasOwnProperty` is called with `object` as the `this` value, which is necessary for the function to work correctly. If `undefined` is used instead, the function will throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `hasOwnProperty` method on `undefined`.
