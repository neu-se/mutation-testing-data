  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return the sum of `x` and `1`, rather than `x` and `y` if they are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return the product of `x` and `y`, rather than `x` and `y` if they are the same.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x - y
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method would return the difference of `x` and `y`, rather than `x` and `y` if they are the same.

DONE.
