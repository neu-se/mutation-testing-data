  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```aborted(abort)```
This would result in different behavior because the ```abort``` function is called with the ```abort``` argument, which is not the same as passing the ```aborted``` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```aborted.error```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value as an argument to the ```cb``` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```undefined```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value as an argument to the ```cb``` function.

DONE.
