  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses change the order of operations, causing the expression to be evaluated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses change the order of operations, causing the expression to be evaluated differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(a + 1) * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses change the order of operations, causing the expression to be evaluated differently.

DONE.
