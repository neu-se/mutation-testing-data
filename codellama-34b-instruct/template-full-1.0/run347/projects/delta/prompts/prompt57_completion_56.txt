  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null || Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical OR operator (`||`) would cause the `else` block to be executed if `ops` is not null, even if `ops.ops` is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops == null && Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical AND operator (`&&`) would cause the `else` block to be executed if `ops` is null and `ops.ops` is an array, even if `ops` is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(ops != null && Array.isArray(ops.ops))
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (`!`) would cause the `else` block to be executed if `ops` is not null and `ops.ops` is not an array, even if `ops` is null
