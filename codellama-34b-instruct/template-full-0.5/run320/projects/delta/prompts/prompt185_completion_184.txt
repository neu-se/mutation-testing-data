  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator would return `'string'` if `otherOp.retain` is a string, which could cause the code to behave differently than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === 'something'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if `otherOp.retain` is equal to the string `'something'`, which could cause the code to behave differently than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be checking if the `length` property of `otherOp.retain` is greater than 0, which could cause the code to behave differently than intended.

DONE.
