  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception instanceof StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` is a function that checks if an exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, but `instanceof` is an operator that checks if an object is an instance of a class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.name === "StopIteration"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` checks if an exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, but `exception.name` is a string that contains the name of the exception, which may not always be the same as the name of the class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.constructor === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because `isStopIteration` checks if an exception is an instance of `StopIteration`, but `exception.constructor` is a reference to the constructor function that created the exception, which may not always be the same as the `
