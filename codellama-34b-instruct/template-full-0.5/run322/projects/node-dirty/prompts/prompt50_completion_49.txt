  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the key plus 1, instead of the value of the key itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the value of the key, instead of the value itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the key concatenated with the string '1', instead of the value itself.

DONE.
