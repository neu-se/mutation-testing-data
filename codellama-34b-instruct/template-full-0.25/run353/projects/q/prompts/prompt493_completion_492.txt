  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reason` parameter is not passed to the `rejected` function, which would cause the `rejected` function to return `undefined` instead of a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(reason, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` parameter is not passed to the `rejected` function, which would cause the `rejected` function to return `undefined` instead of a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>(reason, promise, other)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `other` parameter is not passed to the `rejected` function, which would cause the `rejected` function to return `undefined` instead of a rejected promise.

DONE.
