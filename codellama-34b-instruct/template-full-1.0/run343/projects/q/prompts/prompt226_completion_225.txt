  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method extracts a section of the `arguments` object and returns it as a new array, instead of returning the original `arguments` object. This would cause the `promiseDispatch` method to receive a different set of arguments, potentially leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would extract a different section of the `arguments` object, potentially causing the `promiseDispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(messages, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` method would extract a different section of the `messages` array, potentially causing the `promiseDispatch` method to receive incorrect arguments.

DONE.
