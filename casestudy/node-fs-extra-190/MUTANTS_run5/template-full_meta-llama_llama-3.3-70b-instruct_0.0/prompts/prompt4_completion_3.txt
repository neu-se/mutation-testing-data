Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the logic of the `clobber` option, causing the function to throw an error when `clobber` is `true` and delete the file when `clobber` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
options.clobber === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an explicit type check, potentially changing the behavior if `clobber` is not a boolean value, but rather a truthy or falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof clobber === 'boolean' && clobber
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a type check to ensure `clobber` is a boolean before evaluating its value, potentially changing the behavior if `clobber` is not a boolean value.

DONE.
