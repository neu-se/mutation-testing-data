  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\$1'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal that contains a dollar sign, which is a special character in regular expressions. The buggy code fragment would also contain a dollar sign, but it would be escaped with a backslash, which would cause the regular expression to treat it as a literal dollar sign rather than an anchor for a backreference. This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would match different strings.
