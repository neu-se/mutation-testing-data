  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `memoizeTimezone` function always execute, which would create a new `timezone` object and set it to the `timezones` object, even if the `timezone` property already exists. This would cause the `memoizedTimezones` variable to be updated with the number of properties in the new `timezone` object, which would be 0 since the object is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name = 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `name` property of the `timezone` object to 'UTC', which would cause the `memoizedTimezones` variable to be updated with the number of properties in the `timezone` object, which would be 1 since the `name` property is set.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone.name = 'GMT
