  
Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with: `thisIter.peekType(< dortstadt) === 'insert ' &&`. This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `thisIter.peekType()` method is called without any parameters.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with: `datatype() == bool &&`. This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `thisIter.peekType()` method returns a string representing the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with: `typeof this.ops[index - 1] === 'object' &&`. This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `this.ops` property is an array of objects, and the `typeof` operator is used to inspect the type of the current operation.

DONE.
