  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(0))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method now returns a single element instead of an array, causing the `length` property to return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(2))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method now returns an array of 2 elements, causing the `length` property to return 2 instead of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisIter.next(0))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method now returns a single element instead of an array, causing the `length` property to return `undefined`.

DONE.
