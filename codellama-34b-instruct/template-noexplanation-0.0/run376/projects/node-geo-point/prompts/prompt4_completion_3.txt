  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
```
This code fragment checks if the `type` property of the `point` object is not equal to `'Point'`, which is the opposite of the original code fragment. This change will cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'`, even if the `point` object is an object and has the `type` and `coordinates` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This code fragment checks if the `point` object does not have the `type` or `coordinates` properties, or if the `type` property is not equal to `'Point'`. This change will cause the `fromGeoJSON` method to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object does not have the `type` or `coordinates` properties, or if the `type` property is
