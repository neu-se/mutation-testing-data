  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be executed immediately, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable reference would be evaluated at a later time, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
definition.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function call would be executed with a different context, whereas the original code fragment was a reference to the function.

DONE.
