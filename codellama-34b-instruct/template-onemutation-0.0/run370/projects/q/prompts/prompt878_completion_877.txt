  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. In this case, the `unshift` method would cause the callback to be passed as the first argument to the `FS.readFile` function, rather than the last argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently or produce unexpected results.
