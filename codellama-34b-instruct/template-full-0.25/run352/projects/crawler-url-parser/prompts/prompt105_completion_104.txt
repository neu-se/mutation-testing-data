  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as a string, while the new code fragment uses the `toUpperCase()` method to convert the `text` variable to uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as a string, while the new code fragment uses the `length` property to get the length of the `text` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
text.split(" ").join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text` variable as a string, while the new code fragment uses the `split()` method to split the `text` variable into an array of words, and then uses the `join()` method to join the words back into a string without any spaces.

DONE.
