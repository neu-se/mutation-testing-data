 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return Promise.resolve(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would not receive the original rejection reason, but instead a resolved promise, which would cause the `then` to immediately fulfill, and the `rejection` object would not be created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('New error'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would receive a new error object instead of the original rejection reason, which would cause the `rejection` object to have a different `message` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would not receive any argument, and the `rejection` object would not be created, causing the `deferred.reject` method to be called with no arguments, which would result in an error.

DONE.
