 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it retrieves the values of an object's own enumerable properties, which may not match the original `array` behavior if the input is an object with non-integer keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(array).map(k => array[k] || '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it maps keys to values and replaces undefined values with an empty string, which may not match the original `array` behavior if the input is an object with undefined values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts an array-like object into a real array, which may not match the original `array` behavior if the input is already an array.

DONE.
