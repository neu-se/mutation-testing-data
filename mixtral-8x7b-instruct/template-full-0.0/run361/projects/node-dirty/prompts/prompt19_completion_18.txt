 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets an empty array as the value for the `key` in the `_queue` map, instead of using the existing value or initializing it to an empty array if it doesn't exist. This could cause issues if there are multiple callbacks for the same key, as they would be overwritten and not executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._queue
