  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isNaN` would evaluate to `false` if `this['im']` is `NaN`, while `isNaN` would evaluate to `true`. This would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `false` for some values where it should return `true`.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks if a value is `NaN`. This would cause the `isInfinite` method to return `false` for some values where it should return `true`.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isNaN` would evaluate to `false` if `this['im']` is `NaN`, while `isNaN` would evaluate to `true
