  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var placeholderVariable = promises[index];
promises[index] = placeholderVariable;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise at index `index` to be resolved with the value of the `placeholderVariable`, which is not necessarily the same as the value of the promise at index `index`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index + 1] = promises[index];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise at index `index + 1` to be resolved with the value of the promise at index `index`, which is not necessarily the same as the value of the promise at index `index + 1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[index] = promises[promises.length - index - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise at index `index` to be resolved with the value of the promise at index `promises.length
