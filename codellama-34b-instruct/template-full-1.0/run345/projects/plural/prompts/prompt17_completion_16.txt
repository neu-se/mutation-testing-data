  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/fe?/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match words ending in 'fe', whereas the original code fragment would match words ending in 'x', 'ch', or 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match words ending in 'x', whereas the original code fragment would match words ending in 'ch', 's', or 'x' and return the word with its last letter removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/(.{3}$)/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/(.{3}$)/, '$1es') })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment would match words ending in three characters and return the
