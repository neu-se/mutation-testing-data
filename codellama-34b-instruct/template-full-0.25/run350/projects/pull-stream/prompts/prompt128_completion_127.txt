  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always evaluates to true, while the new code fragment `false` always evaluates to false. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to false, even if `i > max`, which would result in the callback being called with `null` instead of an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `true` always evaluates to true, while the new code fragment `null` always evaluates to false. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to false, even if `i > max`, which would result in the callback being called with `null` instead of an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > max + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `i > max` checks if `i` is greater than `max`, while the new
