  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.filter(policy => policy.name !== undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method filters the array based on the condition provided, whereas the `map` method applies the function to each element of the array and returns a new array with the results. In this case, the `filter` method would remove any policies that do not have a defined `name` property, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policies.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with the elements from the specified start index to the end of the array, whereas the `map` method applies the function to each element of the array and returns a new array with the results. In this case, the `slice` method would return a new array with the policies starting from the second element, which could cause the `query` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEH
