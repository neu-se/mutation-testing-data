  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `__esModule` property to `false`, which would cause the module to be treated as a regular object instead of an ES module. This could potentially cause issues with the module's exports and imports.
