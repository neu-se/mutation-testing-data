  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of a variable as a string. In this case, if `a` is not a function, the condition would evaluate to `true`, even if `a` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, including the type of the variables. In this case, if `a` is not an object, the condition would evaluate to `true`, even if `a` is a function or a different type of object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== Object(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object` function returns a new object with the same properties as the original object. In this case, if `a` is not an object, the condition would evaluate to `true`, even if `a` is a
