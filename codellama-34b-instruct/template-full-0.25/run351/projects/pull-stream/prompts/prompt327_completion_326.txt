  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. If the `end` value is null, the `once` function will not be called, which may cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value. If the `end` value is undefined, the `once` function will not be called, which may cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `false` is a boolean value that indicates the absence of a value. If the `end` value is false, the `once` function will not be called, which may cause the test to fail.
