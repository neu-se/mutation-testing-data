  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `.call` is a method of the `Q` object, but it is not a function that returns a promise like `.apply` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `.bind` is a method of the `Q` object, but it is not a function that returns a promise like `.apply` does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nbind.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `.then` is a method of the `Q` object, but it is not a function that returns a promise like `.apply` does.

DONE.
