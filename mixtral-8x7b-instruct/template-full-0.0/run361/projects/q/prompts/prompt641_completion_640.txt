 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string comparison in the `dispatch` method would fail, causing the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
symbol("post")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method is expecting a string as the operation name, and `symbol("post")` would return a different type, causing the promise to never resolve or reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this.promiseDispatch(deferred.resolve, "post", args)
