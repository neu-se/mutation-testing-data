  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const a = 3;
```
This would result in different behavior because `3` is a constant and would always be the same value, whereas in the original code, `a` is a variable that can hold different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var b = a + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a new variable that is not used in the original code, and the expression `a + 1` would always be evaluated and assigned to `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (a === 3) {
    b = 5;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition `a === 3` would always evaluate to `false` since `a` is assigned to `3`, and `b` would never be assigned the value `5`.

DONE.
