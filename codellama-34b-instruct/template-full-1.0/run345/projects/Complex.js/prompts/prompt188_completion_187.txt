  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment returns the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts the real part of the complex number from the real part of the result, whereas the original code fragment adds them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it divides the real part of the result by the real part of the complex number, whereas the original code fragment multiplies them.

DONE.
