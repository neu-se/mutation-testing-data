  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 180) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to normalize the longitude to the range of (-180, 180], while the new code fragment would normalize it to the range of [0, 360).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 360) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the modulo operator to normalize the longitude to the range of (-180, 180], while the new code fragment would normalize it to the range of [0, 360).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the
