  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable reference, while the new code fragment is a string literal. This could cause the `get` method to return a different value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a variable reference, while the new code fragment is a string literal with a concatenated value. This could cause the `get` method to return a different value than expected, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.
