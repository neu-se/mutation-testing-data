  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("@")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method returns an array of strings, and the `[1]` index would reference the second element of the array, which may not exist if the stack line does not contain an "@" symbol.

DONE.
