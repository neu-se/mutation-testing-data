  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `push` method to merge the `newOp` with the last operation in the `ops` array even if the `newOp` has no attributes, whereas the original code fragment would only merge the `newOp` with the last operation if the `newOp` has attributes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `push` method to merge the `newOp` with the last operation in the `ops` array even if the `newOp` has no attributes, whereas the original code fragment would only merge the `newOp` with the last operation if the `newOp` has attributes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes === {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `push` method to merge the `newOp` with the last operation
