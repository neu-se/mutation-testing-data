  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable "a" is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable "b" is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable "c" is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a ReferenceError.

DONE.
