 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.atan(y / x)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `atan2` function is replaced with the regular `atan` function, which only takes one argument and might not handle edge cases correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.atan2(Math.abs(y), Math.abs(x))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function handles quadrants correctly, while the modified version does not consider the signs of `x` and `y`, leading to incorrect results in certain quadrants.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.atan2(y, x) * 180 / Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function returns the result in radians, while the modified version converts the result to degrees, which might not be expected by the users of the `calculateBearing` function.
