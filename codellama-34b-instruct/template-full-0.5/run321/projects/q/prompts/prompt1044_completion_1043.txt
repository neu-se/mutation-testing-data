  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get()` method to retrieve the value of the `head` property, but this code fragment uses the `get()` method to retrieve the value of the `tail` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head").fail(function (error) {
  closed.resolve(error);
  throw error;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `get()` method to retrieve the value of the `head` property, but this code fragment uses the `fail()` method to handle errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail").then(function (result) {
  return result.fail(function (error) {
    closed.resolve(error);
    throw error;
  });
})
```
This would result in different
