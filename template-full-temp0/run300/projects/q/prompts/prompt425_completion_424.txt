  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the state of the promise, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the promise, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect.reason
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the reason for the rejection of the promise, which is not the same as the original code fragment that returns the promise itself.

DONE.
