  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = !end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the value of `end`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = end
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `end` to `ended`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended = true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `ended` to `true`, which could cause the `read` function to be called with an incorrect value.

DONE.
