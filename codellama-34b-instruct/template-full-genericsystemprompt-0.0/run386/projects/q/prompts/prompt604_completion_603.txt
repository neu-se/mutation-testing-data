  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with a given reason, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise with a given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with a given value, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise with a given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.promise` is a promise object that represents the eventual completion or failure of the asynchronous operation, whereas the original code fragment `deferred.resolve` resolves the promise with a given value.

DONE.
