  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so the `read` function would be called with `true` instead of `ended`, which could cause the stream to be prematurely terminated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `!` operator, so the `ended` variable would be evaluated first, and then the `!end` expression would be evaluated. If `ended` is `true`, the `!end` expression would be `true`, and the `read` function would be called with `true`, which could cause the stream to be prematurely terminated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has lower precedence than the `!` operator, so the `!end` expression would be
