  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `captureLine` function would be called with the wrong argument, which would cause it to return a different value.

DONE.
