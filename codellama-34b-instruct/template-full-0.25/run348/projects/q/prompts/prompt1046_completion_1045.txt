  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.reject` would reject the promise with the given error, whereas `closed.resolve` would resolve the promise with the given error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve(error)` would resolve the promise with the given error, whereas `closed.reject` would reject the promise with the given error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
closed.resolve(new Error("Different error message"))
```
This would result in different behavior because `closed.resolve(new Error("Different error message"))` would resolve the promise with a different error message, whereas `closed.reject` would reject the promise with the given error.

DONE.
