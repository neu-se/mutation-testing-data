  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, { fragment: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fragment` option is set to `false`, which would remove the fragment from the URL. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, { protocol: 'https' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` option is set to `'https'`, which would force the URL to use the HTTPS protocol. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.format(parsedUrl, { host: 'example.com' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `host` option is set to `'example.com'`, which would force the URL to use the hostname `example.com`. This could cause the URL to be parsed differently, potentially
