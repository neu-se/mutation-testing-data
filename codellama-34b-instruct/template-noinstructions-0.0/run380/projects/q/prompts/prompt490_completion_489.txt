  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, while this replacement would always return `rejected`, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, while this replacement would always return the opposite of `rejected`, regardless of the promise's state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is rejected, while this replacement would always return `undefined`, regardless of the promise's state.

DONE.
