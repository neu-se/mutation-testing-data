  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This will cause the `path.resolve()` method to use the current file's directory as the base path, rather than the directory of the file that contains the `image` function. This could potentially cause the `dest` path to be resolved incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This will cause the `path.resolve()` method to use the current working directory as the base path, rather than the directory of the file that contains the `image` function. This could potentially cause the `dest` path to be resolved incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(require.main.filename)
```
This will cause the `path.resolve()` method to use the directory of the file that contains the `image` function as the base path, rather than the directory of the file that contains the `require.main.filename` property. This could potentially cause the `dest` path to be resolved incorrectly.
