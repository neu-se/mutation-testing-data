  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stackCounter
```
This would result in different behavior because it would eliminate the `stackCounter` property from the `p` object, which is used to keep track of the number of stacks in the `makeStackTraceLong` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `valueOf` method on the `stack` property of the `p` object, which would return the primitive value of the property, rather than the property itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p.stack.split(':')[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the `stack` property on the `p` object on the `:` character, and take the second element of the resulting array, which would be the line number of the call stack.

DONE.
