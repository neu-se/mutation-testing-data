 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it includes the `deferred` object in the array, which might cause unexpected behavior in the `resolver` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
