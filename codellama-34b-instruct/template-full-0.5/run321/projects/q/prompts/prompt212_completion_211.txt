  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.constructor === Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if the object is an instance of the class, while `constructor` checks if the object's constructor is the same as the class. In this case, the `Promise` class is being used as a constructor function, so the `constructor` property of the object will be set to `Promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "Promise"
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the object, and "Promise" is not a valid type in JavaScript. This would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, and the function would always return the original `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `instanceof` checks if the object is an instance of the class, while `Object` is a built-in JavaScript object
