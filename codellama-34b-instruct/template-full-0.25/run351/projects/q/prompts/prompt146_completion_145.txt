  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__maximumStackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it may not be defined in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it may not be defined in the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__stackCounter__" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the new property name is different from the original one, and it may not be defined in the object. Additionally, the new property name is a string concatenation of the original property name and the number 1, which may not be a valid property name.

DONE.
