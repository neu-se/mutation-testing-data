 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `[].slice` is the standard array slicing method, while `array_slice` is a custom function that might have different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause a `TypeError` to be thrown when trying to call `.unshift(arguments, 0)` on `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.prototype.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.prototype.slice` is the standard array slicing method, but it should be called with the `call` method to set the `this` value to `arguments`. The current implementation uses a custom `array_slice` function that handles this correctly.

DONE.
