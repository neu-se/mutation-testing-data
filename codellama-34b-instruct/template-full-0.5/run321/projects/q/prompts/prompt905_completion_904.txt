  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, and the `-1` argument indicates that the last element should be excluded. Therefore, this code fragment would create a new array with all the elements from `nodeArgs` except the last one, which would cause the `fapply` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse` method reverses the order of the elements in the array. Therefore, this code fragment would create a new array with the elements from `nodeArgs` in reverse order, which would cause the `fapply` method to receive a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat(["foo"])
```
This would result in different
