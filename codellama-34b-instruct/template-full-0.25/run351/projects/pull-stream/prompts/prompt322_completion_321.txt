  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `a && onEnd` is always false, while `a || !onEnd` is true if `a` is true or `onEnd` is false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `!a && onEnd` is always false, while `a || !onEnd` is true if `a` is false or `onEnd` is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== onEnd` is always true, while `a || !onEnd` is true if `a` is true or `onEnd` is false.

DONE.
