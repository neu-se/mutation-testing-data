  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for a backslash instead of a forward slash, which could cause the code to incorrectly identify URLs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for a forward slash instead of a backslash, which could cause the code to incorrectly identify URLs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\/"
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be looking for a backslash followed by a forward slash, which could cause the code to incorrectly identify URLs.

DONE.
