  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string `"(module.js:1"`, regardless of whether it is a Node frame or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:2"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string `"(module.js:2"`, regardless of whether it is a Node frame or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(module.js:3"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string `"(module.js:3"`, regardless of whether it is a Node frame or not.

DONE.
