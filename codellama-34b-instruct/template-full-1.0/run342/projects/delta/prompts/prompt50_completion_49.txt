  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation has a different result than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello" + "world"
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation operation has a different result than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3][1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the array access operation has a different result than the original code.

DONE.
