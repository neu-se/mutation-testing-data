  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `latitude` property of `point2` to be used in the calculation instead of `point1`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `longitude` property of `point1` to be used in the calculation instead of `latitude`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a random value into the calculation, potentially causing the result to be incorrect.

DONE.
