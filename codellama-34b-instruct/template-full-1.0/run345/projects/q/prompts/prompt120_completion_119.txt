  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnPropertie
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a particular key, while `hasOwnPropertie` is a misspelled version of `hasOwnProperty` that would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function hasOwnProperty() { return false; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a particular key, while `hasOwnProperty = function () { return false; }` is a trivial override that would always return false, regardless of the object's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object with no properties, while `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` is a method that checks if an object has a particular key.

DONE.
