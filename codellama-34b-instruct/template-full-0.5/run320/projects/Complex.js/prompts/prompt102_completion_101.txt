  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 3 ? '-' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the modulo operator is now 3 instead of 2, which would change the result of the conditional expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '+' : '') + c
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional expression now adds instead of subtracts the value of `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + d
```
This would result in different behavior because the conditional expression now uses a different variable `d` instead of `c`.

DONE.
