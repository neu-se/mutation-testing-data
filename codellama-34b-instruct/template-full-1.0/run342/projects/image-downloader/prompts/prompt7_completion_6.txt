  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` is a variable that may be modified by the caller to change the behavior of the function. By replacing it with a constant `true`, we ensure that the function always behaves the same way, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` is a variable that may be modified by the caller to change the behavior of the function. By replacing it with a constant `false`, we ensure that the function never behaves the same way, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `extractFilename` is a variable that may be modified by the caller to change the behavior of the function. By inverting the value of the variable, we ensure that the function always behaves inversely to
