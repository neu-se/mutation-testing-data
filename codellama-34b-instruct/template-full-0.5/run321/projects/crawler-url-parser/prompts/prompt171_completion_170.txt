  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "updomain" when the subdomain of the link URL is longer than the subdomain of the page URL, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len != pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "updomain" when the subdomains of the link URL and page URL are not equal, which is the opposite of the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len === pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to return "updomain" when the subdomains of the link URL and page URL are equal, which is the
