```
a + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type of the return value. The original code fragment returned a string, while the modified code fragment returns a string concatenation of the value of the variable "a" with the value "foo".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && true
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the return expression. The original code fragment returned only the value of the variable "a", while the modified code fragment returns a boolean value, which is always "true" if the value of "a" is a truthy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the return expression. The original code fragment returns only the value of the variable "a", while the modified code fragment returns twice the value of the variable "a".

DONE.
