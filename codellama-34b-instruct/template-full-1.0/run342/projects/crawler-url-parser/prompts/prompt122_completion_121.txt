  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an iterator over the keys in the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `values()` method to return an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries()` method returns an iterator over the key-value pairs in the map, whereas the original code fragment uses the `values()` method to return an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property of a map is the name given to the map at the time of construction, whereas the original code fragment uses the `values()` method to return an iterator over the values in the map.

DONE.
