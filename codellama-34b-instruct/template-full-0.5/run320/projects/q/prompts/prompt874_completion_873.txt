  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is a function that creates a new deferred object, but it is not being used as a function in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a variable that references a deferred object, but it is not being used as a variable in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.defer()` is a function that creates a new deferred object, but it is not being used as a function in the original code fragment.

DONE.
