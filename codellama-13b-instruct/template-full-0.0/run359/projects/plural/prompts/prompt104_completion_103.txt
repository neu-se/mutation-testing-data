  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while the new code fragment appends an "s" to the input word. This would cause the pluralization function to return a plural form that is not correct for all words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while the new code fragment converts the input word to uppercase. This would cause the pluralization function to return a plural form that is not correct for all words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the input word unchanged, while the new code fragment removes
