  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is the regex pattern, while `rule[1]` is the replacement string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[1]` is the replacement string, while `rule[1].substr(1)` would remove the first character of the replacement string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.toUpperCase.call(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because `String.prototype.toUpperCase` is a function that converts a string to uppercase, while the original code fragment was simply returning the `w` variable.

DONE.
