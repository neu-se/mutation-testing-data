  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.push('skirt')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new element would be pushed into the `clothes` array, which would cause the pluralization rule for "skirt" to be applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the last element in the `games` array would be removed, which would cause the pluralization rule for "game" to be applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element in the `illnesses` array would be removed, which would cause the pluralization rule for "illness" to be applied.

DONE.
