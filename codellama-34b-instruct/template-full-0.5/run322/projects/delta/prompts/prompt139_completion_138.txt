  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` returns the number of characters in the current peek, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the current peek.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekType` would return the type of the next peek in the `other` iterator, whereas `thisIter.peekType` returns the type of the current peek in the `this` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `peekType` method, and would cause an error to be thrown.

DONE.
