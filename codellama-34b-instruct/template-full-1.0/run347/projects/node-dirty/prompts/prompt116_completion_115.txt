  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the `'load'` event with the correct number of items in the database, while this replacement code fragment emits a `'load'` event with a size of 0, indicating that the database is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the `'load'` event with the correct number of items in the database, while this replacement code fragment emits a `'load'` event with a size that is 1 more than the correct number of items, indicating that there is an additional item in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the `'load'` event with the correct number of items in the database, while this replacement code fragment emits
