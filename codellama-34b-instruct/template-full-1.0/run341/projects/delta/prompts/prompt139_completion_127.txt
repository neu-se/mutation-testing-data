  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` would return the length of the next operation, rather than its type, which could cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekData
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekData` would return the data of the next operation, which could cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.advance
```
This would result in different behavior because `advance` would advance the iterator to the next operation, which could cause the code to take a different path, potentially leading to a bug.

DONE.
