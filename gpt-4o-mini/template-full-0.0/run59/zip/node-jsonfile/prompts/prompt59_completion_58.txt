Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\0/g, EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces null characters (`\0`) in the string instead of newline characters (`\n`), which may lead to incorrect string formatting when the input object contains newlines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces newline characters (`\n`) with a space character (`' '`), altering the intended line breaks in the output string and potentially making it less readable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\n/g, 'EOL'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces newline characters (`\n`) with the literal string `'EOL'`, which would not insert the intended line breaks and instead insert the text 'EOL' into the output.

DONE.
