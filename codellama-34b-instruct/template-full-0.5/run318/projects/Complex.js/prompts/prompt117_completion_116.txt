  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In this case, `a + b` would return the sum of `a` and `b`, which could be different from the original result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In this case, `a * b` would return the product of `a` and `b`, which could be different from the original result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the comma operator, which evaluates both operands and returns the second one. In this case, `a / b` would return the quotient of `a` and `b`, which could be different from the original result.
