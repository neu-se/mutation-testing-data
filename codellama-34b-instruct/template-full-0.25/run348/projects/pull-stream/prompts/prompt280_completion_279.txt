  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only passes one argument to the `mapper` function, while this modified code fragment passes two arguments. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(data, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `mapper` function, while this modified code fragment passes `null` as the second argument. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave differently, potentially leading to test failures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` argument to the `mapper` function, while this modified code fragment passes `null` as the first argument. This could cause the `mapper` function to behave
