 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Array global's slice method instead of the utility module's array\_slice function. This might cause issues if the code relies on the specific behavior of array\_slice, such as handling sparse arrays or non-array objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.max
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Math global's max method, which has a completely different purpose. This would likely cause a TypeError, as the array\_slice function expects an array-like object and a starting index as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the Promise global's all method, which is used to create a promise that resolves when all of the given promises are resolved. This would not only cause a TypeError but also change the behavior of the code, as it would
