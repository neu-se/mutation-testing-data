  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, regardless of the value of `flushing`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `!flushing` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, regardless of the value of `flushing`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing + 1` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, regardless of the value of `flushing`.

DONE.
