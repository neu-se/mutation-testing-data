  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${rowStr}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the error message, while the replacement code fragment emits an error event with a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${key}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the error message, while the replacement code fragment emits an error event with a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Could not load corrupted row: ${val}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error event with the error message, while the replacement code fragment emits an error event with a different error message.

DONE.
