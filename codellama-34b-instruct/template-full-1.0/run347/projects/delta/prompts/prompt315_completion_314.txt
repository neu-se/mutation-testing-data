  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(thisOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the length of the operation, potentially causing the algorithm to misbehave.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the length of the operation, potentially causing the algorithm to misbehave.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the length of the operation, potentially causing the algorithm to misbehave.

DONE.
