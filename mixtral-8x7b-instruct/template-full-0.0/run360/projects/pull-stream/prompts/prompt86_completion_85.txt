 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false, cb || function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` function would always be called with `false` as the first argument, even if `abort` is not set, which could cause unintended behavior in the `read` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `read` would always be an empty function, regardless of the value of `cb`, which could cause unintended behavior if the original callback function was supposed to do something.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb && cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function passed to `read` would only be called if `cb` is truthy, which could cause unintended behavior if the original callback function was supposed to be called regardless of the value of `cb`.

DONE.
