  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` instead of `true`, causing the `err.message` to be returned instead of being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow && err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, causing the `err.message` to be thrown instead of being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow || err.message
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` instead of `false`, causing the `err.message` to be thrown instead of being returned.

DONE.
