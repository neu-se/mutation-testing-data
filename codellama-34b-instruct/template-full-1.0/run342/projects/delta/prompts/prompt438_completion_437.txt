  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOpType = typeof nextOp.retain;
if (nextOpType === 'number' && nextOp.retain > 0) {...}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type of `nextOp.retain` to be `'number'` and also checks if the value is greater than zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOpType = typeof nextOp.retain;
if (nextOpType === 'number' && nextOp.retain > 10) {...}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the type of `nextOp.retain` to be `'number'`, but also checks if the value is greater than `10`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const nextOpType = typeof nextOp.retain;
if (nextOpType === 'Number') {...}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the
