  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromPromise` is a different function than `universalify.fromCallback`, and it may not handle errors in the same way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(null)` would pass `null` as the first argument to `fs.readFile`, which is not the same as passing `fs.readFile` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)` would pass `fs.readFile` as the first argument to `universalify.fromCallback`, which is not the same as passing `fs.readFile` directly.

DONE.
