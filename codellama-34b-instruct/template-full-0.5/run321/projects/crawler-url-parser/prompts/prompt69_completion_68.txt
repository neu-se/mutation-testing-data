  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://example.com"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a hardcoded URL instead of the original `sourceUrl` variable, which could potentially return different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl + "?utm_source=mutation"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a modified URL that includes a query parameter, which could potentially affect the results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a URL that has been modified to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, which could potentially affect the results.

DONE.
