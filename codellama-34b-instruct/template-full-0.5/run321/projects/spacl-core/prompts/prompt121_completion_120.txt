  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `true` for any path that matches the rule's regex, regardless of the context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.path.match(this.regex)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `true` for any path that matches the rule's regex and is in the same context as the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.match(this.regex, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `matches` method to return `true` for any path that matches the rule's regex and is in the same context as the rule, but it would also pass the context to the `match` method, which would allow for more specific matching.

DONE.
