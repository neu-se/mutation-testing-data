Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the context of the function (`this`) instead of the arguments array, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when the callback expects an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always pass a fixed array of values `[1, 2, 3]` to the callback, regardless of the actual arguments provided, which could lead to incorrect results in the decorated function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` instead of the actual arguments, which would likely cause the callback to fail or behave unexpectedly since it would not receive the expected input.

DONE.
