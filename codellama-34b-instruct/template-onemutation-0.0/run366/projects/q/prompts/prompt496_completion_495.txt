  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `rejection` is a variable that is defined in the scope of the `reject` function, while `null` is a constant that is not defined in the scope of the `reject` function. Using `null` instead of `rejection` would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
