Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of attempting to create a stack trace for the error, it simply logs the error to the console, which may lead to unhandled promise rejections not being properly tracked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it overrides the default error handling mechanism, effectively silencing any unhandled errors without notifying the user, which could lead to silent failures in the promise chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Unhandled promise rejection");
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws a new error with a generic message instead of preserving the original error context, which could make debugging more difficult as the original error information is lost.

DONE.
