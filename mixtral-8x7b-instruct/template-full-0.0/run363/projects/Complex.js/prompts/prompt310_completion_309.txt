 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
2 * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the real part of the complex number, instead of the original code which uses the variable `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the expression with the constant `Math.PI`, which would not depend on the properties of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.cos(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part, and it would use the `Math.cos` function instead of multiplying by 2.

DONE.
