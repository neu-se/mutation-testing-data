Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream('invalid/path/to/file')
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to create a write stream to an invalid file path, which would cause an error when trying to write to the stream, leading to a rejection of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it opens the write stream in append mode instead of the default write mode, which could lead to unexpected data being appended to the file instead of overwriting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.pipe(createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf8' }))
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifies an encoding for the write stream, which may not be appropriate for binary data, potentially corrupting the downloaded file if the response is not text-based.

DONE.
