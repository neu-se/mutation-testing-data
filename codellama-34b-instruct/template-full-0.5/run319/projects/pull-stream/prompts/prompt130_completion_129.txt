  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, which means that the `if` statement that checks for `end` would evaluate to `true` even if `end` is not `null`. This could cause the function to return `cb(true)` unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value in JavaScript that represents "Not a Number". When used in a comparison, `NaN` is always `false`, which means that the `if` statement that checks for `end` would evaluate to `false` even if `end` is `NaN`. This could cause the function to return `cb(true)` unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a special value in JavaScript that represents an infinite number. When used in a comparison, `Infinity
