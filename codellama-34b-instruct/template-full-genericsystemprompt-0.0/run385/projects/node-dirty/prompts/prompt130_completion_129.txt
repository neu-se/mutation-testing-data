  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would shift the queue instead of iterating over it, which could cause the code to miss some elements in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pop the queue instead of iterating over it, which could cause the code to miss some elements in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the queue instead of iterating over it, which could cause the code to miss some elements in the queue.

DONE.
