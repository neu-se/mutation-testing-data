  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
--
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the regular expression match any character instead of a specific character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the regular expression match any character in a character class instead of a specific character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the regular expression match any character in a character class with a quantifier instead of a specific character.

DONE.
