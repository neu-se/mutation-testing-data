  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the match is null, and if it is, it returns false. However, if we replace it with `match !== null`, it will return true if the match is not null, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the match is null, and if it is, it returns false. However, if we replace it with `match.length === 0`, it will return true if the match is an empty string, which is not the same as null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
match.indexOf('') === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the match is null, and if it is, it returns false. However, if we replace it with `match.indexOf('') === 0`,
