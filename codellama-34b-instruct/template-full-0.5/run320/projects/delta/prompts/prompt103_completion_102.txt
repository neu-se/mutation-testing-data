  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(0, 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method would only return the first 10 elements of the ops array, whereas the filter method would return all elements that pass the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map(op => op.delete)
```
This would result in different behavior because the map method would return a new array containing only the delete properties of the ops objects, whereas the filter method would return all elements that pass the predicate function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, op) => acc + op.retain, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the reduce method would return the sum of all retain properties of the ops objects, whereas the filter method would return all elements that pass the predicate function.

DONE.
