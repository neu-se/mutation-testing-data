  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is resolved, whereas `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `onRejected` is a function that is called when the promise is rejected, whereas `onFulfilled` is a function that is called when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected, and it would not have the same side effects as `onFulfilled` or `onRejected`.

DONE.
