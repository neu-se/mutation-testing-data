 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL('http://' + pageurl.host + pageurl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object with the 'http://' protocol, even if the original 'pageurl' object has a different protocol. This could potentially cause issues if the code relies on the original protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new URL('https://' + pageurl.host + pageurl.path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new URL object with the 'https://' protocol, even if the original 'pageurl'
