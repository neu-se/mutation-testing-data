  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'], this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are added together, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are multiplied together, which would cause the calculation to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
