  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any string that starts with a slash and ends with a slash, whereas the original code only matched a string that ends with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/(?!$)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any string that starts with a slash and ends with a slash, but does not match a string that ends with a slash and has no characters before it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/(?!\/)/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches any string that starts with a slash and ends with a slash, but does not match a string that ends with a slash and has no characters before it, and also does not match a string that ends with a slash and has a slash before it.

DONE.
