 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.read
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.read` might refer to a different `read` function in the context of the outer function, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return read }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that always returns the `read` function, instead of invoking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function with a specified `this` value, potentially causing issues if the original `read` function relies on its `this` value.

DONE.
