  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, while `fs.writeFileSync` does not take a callback. This would cause the code to fail at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, while `fs.writeFile` does not take a callback. This would cause the code to fail at runtime.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because `universalify.fromCallback` expects a function that takes a callback as its last argument, while `fs.readFile` does not take a callback. This would cause the
