  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `opData` variable, which is an object, while this modified code fragment uses the `opData + 1` expression, which is a number. This could cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `opData` variable, which is an object, while this modified code fragment uses the `opData.length` expression, which is a number. This could cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to return a different value, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opData[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `op
