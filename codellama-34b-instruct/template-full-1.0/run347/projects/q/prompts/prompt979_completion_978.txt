  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `makeNodeResolver()` without any arguments, while the modified code calls it with an argument of `null`. This could potentially cause the program to behave differently, especially if the `makeNodeResolver()` function has different behavior depending on whether it's called with or without an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.noConflict()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code doesn't have a `noConflict()` method, while the modified code does. This could potentially cause the program to behave differently, especially if the `noConflict()` method has different behavior depending on whether it's called or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `push()` to add an element to the end of an array, while the modified code calls `shift()` to
