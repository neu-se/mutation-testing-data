  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a new promise, whereas `get` is a method that returns the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `catch` is a method that returns a new promise that is rejected with the error, whereas `get` is a method that returns the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `finally` is a method that returns a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, whereas `get` is a method that returns the value of the promise.

DONE.
