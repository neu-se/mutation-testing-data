Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which would lead to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the latitude of the second point, which would distort the bearing calculation by artificially altering the angle.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1 + φ2
```
This would result in different behavior because it sums the latitudes of both points instead of using the latitude of the second point, leading to an incorrect bearing calculation.

DONE.
