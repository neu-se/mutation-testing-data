  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 ** zoom
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 ** zoom` is a different expression than `2, zoom`. The former is the result of raising `2` to the power of `zoom`, while the latter is a tuple with `2` and `zoom` as its elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zoom ** 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `zoom ** 2` is a different expression than `2, zoom`. The former is the result of raising `zoom` to the power of `2`, while the latter is a tuple with `2` and `zoom` as its elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(zoom, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(zoom, 2)` is a different expression than `2, zoom`. The former is the result of raising `zoom` to the power of `
