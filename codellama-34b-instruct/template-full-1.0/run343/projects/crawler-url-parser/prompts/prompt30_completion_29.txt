  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is not anchored to the start of the string, allowing it to match anywhere in the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!\w+:\/\/)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the start of the string only if the first character is not a word character, followed by a colon, and then a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(\w+:)?\/\/)/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression matches the start of the string only if there is a word character followed by a colon, and then a forward slash.

DONE.
