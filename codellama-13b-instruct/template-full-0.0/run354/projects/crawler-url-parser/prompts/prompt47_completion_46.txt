  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedBaseUrl` object has a `protocol` property that is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedBaseUrl` object has a `host` property that is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedBaseUrl.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parsedBaseUrl` object has a `pathname` property that is not present in the original code fragment.

DONE.
