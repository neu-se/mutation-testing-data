  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument would be used instead of the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be used instead of the third argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[arguments[2]]
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument would be used instead of the third argument.

DONE.
