  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` while this code fragment decrements `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` while this code fragment always returns the value of `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i % max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` while this code fragment returns the remainder of `i` divided by `max`.

DONE.
