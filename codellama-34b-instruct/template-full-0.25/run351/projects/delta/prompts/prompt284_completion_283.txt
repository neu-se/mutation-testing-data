  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\r\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character to a carriage return and line feed, which would affect the formatting of the text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\n\r'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character to a line feed and carriage return, which would also affect the formatting of the text.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\t'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the newline character to a tab character, which would affect the formatting of the text.

DONE.
