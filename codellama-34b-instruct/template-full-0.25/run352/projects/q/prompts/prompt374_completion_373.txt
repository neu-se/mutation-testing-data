  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error message instead of the error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log the error stack trace instead of the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a string representation of the error object instead of the object itself.

DONE.
