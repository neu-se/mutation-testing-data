  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_lastIndexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would search for the last occurence of the promise, instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledReasons, promise) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would search for the index of the promise + 1, instead of the actual index of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_length - array_indexOf(unhandledReasons, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would find the position of the promise in the array, and then return the length of the array - that position, instead of the actual index of the promise.

DONE.
