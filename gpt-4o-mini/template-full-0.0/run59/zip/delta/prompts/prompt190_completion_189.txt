Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the current operation (`thisOp`) instead of the newly created operation (`newOp`), potentially altering the resulting delta by including an operation that should not be part of the composition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `otherOp` instead of the `newOp`, which could lead to incorrect composition results by including an operation from the other delta that may not be intended in the current context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly manipulates the `ops` array of the `delta` object instead of using the `push` method, which could bypass any additional logic or checks that the `push` method might perform, leading to potential inconsistencies in the delta's state.

DONE.
