  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let key in tzs) { if (!tzs[key].deprecated) { ... } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the enumerable properties of the `tzs` object, rather than the non-enumerable properties of the `Object` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the values of the enumerable properties of the `tzs` object, rather than the non-enumerable properties of the `Object` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.getOwnPropertyNames
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the names of the non-enumerable properties of the `tzs` object, rather than the enumerable properties of the `Object` object.

DONE.
