  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || !Array.isArray(point.coordinates)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow objects with a `type` property that is not `'Point'` and arrays with a `coordinates` property that is not an array to be passed to the `fromGeoJSON` method, which would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` instead of a `RangeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point' || point.coordinates.length !== 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow objects with a `type` property that is not `'Point'` and arrays with a `coordinates` property that does not have a length of 2 to be passed to the `fromGeoJSON` method, which would cause the method to throw a `TypeError` instead of a `RangeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.type !== 'Point'
