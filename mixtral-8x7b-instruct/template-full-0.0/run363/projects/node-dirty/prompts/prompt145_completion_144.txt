 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.process.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits the event at the global process level instead of the current instance of Dirty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always passes `null` as the first argument to the 'drain' event listener, even if an error occurred.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit.apply(global.process, ['drain'])
