  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on the `point` object, which would return `false` if the `type` property is inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on the `point` object, which would return `false` if the `type` property is inherited from the prototype chain.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(point, 'type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is being called on the `Object.prototype` object, which would return `true` if the `type` property is inherited from the prototype chain.

DONE.
