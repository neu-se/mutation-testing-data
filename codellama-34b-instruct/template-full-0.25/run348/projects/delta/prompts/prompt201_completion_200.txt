  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method on the result of `concat`, which is a `Delta` object, while this code fragment calls the `chop` method on the `rest` object, which is a `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method without any arguments, while this code fragment calls the `chop` method with the argument `1`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `chop` method without any arguments, while this code fragment calls the `chop` method with the argument `2`.

DONE.
