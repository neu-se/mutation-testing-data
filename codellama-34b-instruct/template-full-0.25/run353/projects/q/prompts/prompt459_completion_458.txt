  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of an array is a number that represents the number of elements in the array, whereas `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections[0]` would return the first promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledRejections.pop()` would remove and return the last promise in the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas `unhandledRejections` is an array of promises.

DONE.
