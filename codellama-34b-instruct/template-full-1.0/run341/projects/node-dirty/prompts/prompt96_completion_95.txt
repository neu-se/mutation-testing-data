  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`row.key === undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `in` operator to check if the key exists in the `row` object, but the new code checks if the key is equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`!row.val`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `key` exists in the `row` object, but the new code checks if the `val` property of the `row` object is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`row.key === 'invalid_key'`
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the `key` exists in the `row` object, but the new code checks if the `key` is equal to a specific value that is not in the `row` object.

DONE.
