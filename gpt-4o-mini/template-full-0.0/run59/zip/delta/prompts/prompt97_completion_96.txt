Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at the index of the last operation plus one, effectively adding it to the end of the array instead of the intended position, which could disrupt the order of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to insert the new operation at an invalid index (negative index), which could lead to unexpected results or errors when manipulating the `this.ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation one position after the current index, potentially skipping over the intended position and altering the sequence of operations in the `this.ops` array.

DONE.
