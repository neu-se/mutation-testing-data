  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the wrong context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the callback to be called with the wrong context and arguments.

DONE.
