  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the bind method is not being called with the correct `this` context, which is `continuer` in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the bind method is not being called with the correct `this` context, which is `continuer` in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the bind method is not being called with the correct `this` context, which is `continuer` in this case.

DONE.
