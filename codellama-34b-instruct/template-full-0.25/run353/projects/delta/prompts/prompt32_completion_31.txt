  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is an object, and `attr` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attr[key]` is a string, and `base` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key] = base[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the value of `base[key]` to `attr[key]`, which is not the same as simply returning `base[key]`.

DONE.
