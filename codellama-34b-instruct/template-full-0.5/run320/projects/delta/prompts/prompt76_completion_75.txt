  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `arg` is a string and has length 0, but this replacement would cause the `insert` property of `newOp` to be set to `null`, which would not pass the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `attributes` is an object with at least one key, but this replacement would cause the `attributes` property of `newOp` to be set to an empty object, which would not pass the check.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `length` is a number and is greater than 0, but this replacement would cause the `retain` property of `newOp` to be set to 0, which would
