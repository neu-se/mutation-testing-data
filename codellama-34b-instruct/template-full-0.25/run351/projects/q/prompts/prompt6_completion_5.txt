  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports !== "object" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if `exports` is not an object, and `module` is an object. This would invert the original condition, causing the code to execute differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof exports === "function" && typeof module === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator is used to check if `exports` is a function, and `module` is an object. This would change the type of the `exports` variable, causing the code to execute differently.

```
typeof exports === "object" && typeof module !== "object"
