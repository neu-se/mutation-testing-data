  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the `if` statement, causing the `once` function to be called regardless of whether `a` is true or false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called only if `a` is true or if `onEnd` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called only if `a` is true and `onEnd` is falsey.

DONE.
