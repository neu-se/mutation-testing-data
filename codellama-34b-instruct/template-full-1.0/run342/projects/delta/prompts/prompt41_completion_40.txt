  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the `a` and `b` arguments, causing the resulting `attributes` object to be the opposite of what was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set all attribute values to `undefined`, effectively removing all attributes from the resulting `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set all attribute values to an empty object, effectively removing all attributes from the resulting `attributes` object.

DONE.
