  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the object as a string, while the original code fragment returns the type of the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the constructor function that created the object, while the original code fragment returns the type of the value.

DONE.
