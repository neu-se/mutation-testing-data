  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have the `retain` property, which is an object. The `retain` property is being accessed in the original code snippet, so this replacement would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT operator and would negate the value of `otherOp`, which is a boolean. This would cause the code to perform the opposite of what it was intended to do, potentially resulting in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.median
```
This would result in different behavior because `median` is not a property of `otherOp`, which is an object. This would cause the code to throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
