  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This code fragment is a direct replacement for the original code fragment, but it has a different behavior. In the original code, the `cb` function is called with the `ended` variable as its first argument, which is a boolean value indicating whether the stream has ended. In the modified code, the `cb` function is called with `null` as its first argument, which is not a boolean value. This change could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, and it could potentially introduce a bug.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended, data)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code, but it uses the `ended` variable as the first argument to the `cb` function, rather than `null`. This change could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, and it could potentially introduce a bug.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This code fragment is different
