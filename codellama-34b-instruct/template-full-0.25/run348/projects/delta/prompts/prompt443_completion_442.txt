  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be extracted from the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object. Replacing it with `0` would cause the substring to be empty, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be extracted from the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object. Replacing it with `length - 1` would cause the substring to be one character shorter, which would result in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to determine the length of the substring to be extracted from the `insert` property of the `nextOp` object.
