  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an array of arguments, but the new code fragment is passing an empty array. This could cause the promise to be rejected with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an array of arguments, but the new code fragment is passing undefined. This could cause the promise to be rejected with an error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting an array of arguments, but the new code fragment is passing null. This could cause the promise to be rejected with an error message.

DONE.
