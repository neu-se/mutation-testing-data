  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\/$, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the dollar sign instead of the caret sign, which means that the replacement will only occur at the end of the string instead of at the start.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(http\:\/\/)/, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the caret sign at the start and the dollar sign at the end, which means that the replacement will only occur if the string starts with "http://" and ends with a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(\/)\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a forward slash to match the start of the string and then uses the caret sign to match the end of the string, which means that the replacement will only occur if the string starts with a forward slash and ends with "http://".
