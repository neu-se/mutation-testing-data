  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` is an operator that returns a string indicating the type of a variable, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(rule[0])` is a function that returns a string indicating the type of an object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0].constructor.name` is a string indicating the type of an object, while `type` is a function that returns the type of an object.

DONE.
