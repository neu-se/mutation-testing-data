 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would consider promises in the "pending" state as fulfilled, which could lead to incorrect handling of promises in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFulfilled` function would return true for null values, which are not promises. This could lead to incorrect handling of values and fulfilled promises in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return {}; }
