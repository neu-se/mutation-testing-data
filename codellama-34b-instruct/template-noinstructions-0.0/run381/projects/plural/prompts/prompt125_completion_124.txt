  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/e$/, 'es') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would not modify words that end in "e" to add the "s" ending, while the new code fragment would add the "s" ending to all words that end in "e".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/e$/, 'ies') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add the "s" ending to all words that end
