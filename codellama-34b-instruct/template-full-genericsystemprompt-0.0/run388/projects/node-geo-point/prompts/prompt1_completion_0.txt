  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === null || longitude === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `null` values for `latitude` and `longitude`, which would cause the constructor to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === undefined || longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `undefined` values for `latitude` and `longitude`, which would cause the constructor to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
latitude === 0 || longitude === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `0` values for `latitude` and `longitude`, which would cause the constructor to throw an error.

DONE.
