 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function is replaced with an empty function, which would not execute the provided `progressed` function when a progress notification is emitted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the integer `42` is not a function, and thus would throw a `TypeError` when the `then` method tries to call it as a callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is a function that resolves the deferred, which is not the same as notifying progress. This would cause the promise to be immediately fulfilled instead of emitting a progress notification.

DONE.
