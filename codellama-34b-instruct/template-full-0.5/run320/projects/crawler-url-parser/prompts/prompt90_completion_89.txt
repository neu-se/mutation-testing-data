  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof href` check is removed, which would allow links with a length less than 3 to be included in the `urlMap`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || href.length < 3 || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof href` check is removed, which would allow links with a length less than 3 to be included in the `urlMap`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof href == "undefined" || /^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:)/ig.test(href)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href.length < 3` check is removed, which would allow links with a length greater than or equal
