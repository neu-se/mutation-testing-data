  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be offset by 180 degrees, which would cause the calculated bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be doubled, which would cause the calculated bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(this, point) - 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be offset by -180 degrees, which would cause the calculated bearing to be incorrect.

DONE.
