  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"del"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `del` method instead of the `delete` method, which may have different functionality or behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"remove"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `remove` method instead of the `delete` method, which may have different functionality or behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the string "1" to the end of the string "delete", resulting in the string "delete1", which may not be a valid method name or have different functionality.

DONE.
