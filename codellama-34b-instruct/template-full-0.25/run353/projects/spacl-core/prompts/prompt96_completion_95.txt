  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to set the value of the map to `null` instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy that is not explicitly allowed or denied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to set the value of the map to `undefined` instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `null` for any policy that is not explicitly allowed or denied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name, new Policy()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to set the value of the map to a new `Policy` object instead of the `policy` object, which would cause the `query` method to return `true
