  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```object.hasOwnProperty()
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` is a method that returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property. Without the parentheses, it would return a reference to the method itself, which would likely cause a type error when the code is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```object.hasOwnProperty.call(object, 'longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that allows you to invoke a function with a specific `this` value and arguments. In this case, it would invoke `hasOwnProperty` with `object` as the `this` value and `'longitude'` as the first argument. This would check whether the `object` has an own property called `'longitude'`, which might not be the same as checking whether the object has a property called `'longitude'` in general.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```object.has
