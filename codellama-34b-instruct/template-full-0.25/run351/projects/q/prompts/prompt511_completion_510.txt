  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is a concatenation of the `args` array and any other arrays passed as arguments, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, args.filter()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.filter()` creates a new array that contains only the elements of the `args` array that pass a test implemented by the provided function, which may not be the desired behavior in all cases.

DONE.
