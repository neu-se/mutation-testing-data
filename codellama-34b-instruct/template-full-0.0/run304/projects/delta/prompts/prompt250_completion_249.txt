  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and adding 1 to it would cause the `diff()` method to consider one more character than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the `diff()` method to consider one fewer character than it should, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, and multiplying it by 2 would cause the `diff()` method to consider twice as many characters
