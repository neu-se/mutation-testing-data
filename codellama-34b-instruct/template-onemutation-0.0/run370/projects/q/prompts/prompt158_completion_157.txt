  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `stack` property of the `error` object would be set to `null`, which would cause the `filterStackString` function to return an empty string, even if the `stack` property was previously set to a non-empty string. This would cause the `makeStackTraceLong` function to return a promise that resolves to an object with a `stack` property that is not a string, which could cause issues in the code that uses the promise.
