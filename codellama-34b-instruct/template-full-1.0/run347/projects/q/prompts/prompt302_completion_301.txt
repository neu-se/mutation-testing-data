  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x != y
```
This would result in different behavior because `!=` performs a `not equal to` comparison, which would evaluate to `true` if `x` and `y` have different values, even if they have the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x > y
```
This would result in different behavior because `>` performs a `greater than` comparison, which would evaluate to `true` if `x` is greater than `y`, and would not evaluate to `true` if `x` and `y` have the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because `+` performs an addition operation, which would return the result of adding `x` and `y`, regardless of their values or types. This would evaluate to `true` if the result of the addition operation is not `0`, and would evaluate to `false` otherwise.

DONE.
