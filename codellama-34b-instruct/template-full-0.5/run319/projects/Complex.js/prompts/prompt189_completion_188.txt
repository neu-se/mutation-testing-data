  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is equal to 0. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `a` is not equal to 0, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `a` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `a` is equal to 0, which could lead to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is not equal to
