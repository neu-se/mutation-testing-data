  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.resolve(ends.promise.get("head"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.defer()` to create a new promise, but this replacement code uses `next.resolve()` to resolve the promise immediately, which could cause the promise to be resolved before it is expected to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next.resolve(ends.promise.get("tail"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment used `Q.defer()` to create a new promise, but this replacement code uses `next.resolve()` to resolve the promise immediately, which could cause the promise to be resolved before it is expected to be resolved. Additionally, this replacement code uses `ends.promise.get("tail")` instead of `ends.promise.get("head")`, which could cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
