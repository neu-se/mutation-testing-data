  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` have different ranges and values, and using `sinh` instead of `cosh` would cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `cosh` have different ranges and values, and using `tanh` instead of `cosh` would cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `coth` and `cosh` have different ranges and values, and using `coth` instead of `cosh` would cause the function to produce incorrect results.

DONE.
