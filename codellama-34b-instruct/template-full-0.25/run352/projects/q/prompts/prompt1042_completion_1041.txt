  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ends.promise.get`, which returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property, but the new code fragment `ends.promise.get("head")` returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property of the `head` property, which is not the same thing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ends.promise.get`, which returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property, but the new code fragment `ends.promise.get("tail")` returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `tail` property of the `head` property, which is not the same thing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.
