  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?woman$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern has been modified to include the letter "w" before the letter "a" in the word "woman." In the original code fragment, the regex pattern matches the words "man" and "woman," but since the "w" in "woman" is not included in the pattern, the code would not work as intended for words that have the letter "w" before the letter "a."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(?:wo)?man$/i, function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `String.prototype.replace()` function has been modified to replace the first occurrence of the letter "a" in the word "man" with the letter "e." In the original code fragment, the function replaces the first occurrence of the
