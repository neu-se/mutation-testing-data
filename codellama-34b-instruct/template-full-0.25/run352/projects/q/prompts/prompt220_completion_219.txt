  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `Q.longStackSupport` flag to be `true`, even if it was not set to `true` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `Q.longStackSupport` flag to be `false`, even if it was set to `true` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.env.Q_DEBUG = !process.env.Q_DEBUG;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `Q.longStackSupport` flag, regardless of its original value.

DONE.
