  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is not called on the original promise returned by `nfapply`, which could lead to unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).fail(function () {
    deferred.reject();
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a different function, which could lead to different behavior in the event of a rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).nfapply(args).fail(deferred.reject.bind(deferred));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called with a bound function, which could lead to different behavior in the event of a rejection.

DONE.
