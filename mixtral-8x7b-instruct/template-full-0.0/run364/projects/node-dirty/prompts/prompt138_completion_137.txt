 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the `JSON.stringify` method, which would then treat `key` as a string literal instead of a variable reference. This could lead to incorrectly formatted data being written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the `key` property of the current object, which might not exist or might have a different value than the intended variable. This could lead to incorrect data being written to the file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number instead of the intended key value. This could lead to unpredictable results and make it difficult to reproduce the behavior of the code.

DONE.
