  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dispatch(object, op, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` is a function that is not defined in the code snippet provided, and it is not clear what its purpose is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a method on the `object` with the name `op` and pass `args` as an argument, whereas the original code calls the `dispatch` function with `object`, `op`, and `args` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[op](args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call a method on the `object` with the name `op` and pass `args` as an argument, whereas the original code calls the `dispatch` function with `object`, `op`, and `args` as arguments.

DONE.
