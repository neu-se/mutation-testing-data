  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` creates a resolved promise, whereas `Promise.reject` creates a rejected promise. If the code is changed to `Promise.resolve`, the function will return a resolved promise with the error message as its value, rather than a rejected promise with the error message as its reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, whereas `Promise.reject` is a truthy value. If the code is changed to `null`, the function will return `null` instead of a rejected promise, which could cause issues if the calling code is expecting a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, whereas `Promise.reject` is a truthy value. If the code is changed to `
