  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, ' '
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a single space, which would not match the same pattern as the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'abc'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a non-empty string, which would not match the same pattern as the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement string is a URL protocol, which would not match the same pattern as the original code fragment.

DONE.
