  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the real part of the complex number would cause the `equals` method to return `false` when comparing two complex numbers that are equal in magnitude but have different real parts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the real part of the complex number would cause the `equals` method to return `false` when comparing two complex numbers that are equal in magnitude but have different real parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number would be used instead of the real part, causing the `equals` method to return `false` when comparing two complex numbers that are equal in magnitude but have different real parts.

DONE.
