  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and `insert` would insert a new element at the beginning of the delta, while `push` would append a new element to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and `delete` would remove an element from the delta, while `push` would append a new element to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and `retain` would modify the attributes of an existing element in the delta, while `push` would append a new element to the end.

DONE.
