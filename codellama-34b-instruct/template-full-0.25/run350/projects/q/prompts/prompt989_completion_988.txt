  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.sort()` would sort the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.pop()` would remove the last element of the array, which would cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
