  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.path
```
This would result in different behavior because the `path` property of the `parsedUrl` object is a string representing the path of the URL, whereas the original code fragment `parsedUrl` is an object representing the parsed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hostname` property of the `parsedUrl` object is a string representing the hostname of the URL, whereas the original code fragment `parsedUrl` is an object representing the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parsedUrl.protocol
```
This would result in different behavior because the `protocol` property of the `parsedUrl` object is a string representing the protocol of the URL, whereas the original code fragment `parsedUrl` is an object representing the parsed URL.

DONE.
