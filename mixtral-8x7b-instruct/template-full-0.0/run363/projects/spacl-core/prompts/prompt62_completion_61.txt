 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.sort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the `props` array would be changed, which could impact the behavior of the code that uses this `Matcher` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
['someProp']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `props` array would be replaced with a new array containing a single string 'someProp', which is not the same as reversing the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.filter(prop => prop.length > 0)
