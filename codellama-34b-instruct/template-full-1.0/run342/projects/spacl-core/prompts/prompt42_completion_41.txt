  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `part` variable is a string, and adding 1 to it will cause it to be coerced into a number, resulting in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because concatenating a string to `part` will change its value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.length` will return the length of the `part` string, which is not necessarily the same as the original value of `part`.

DONE.
