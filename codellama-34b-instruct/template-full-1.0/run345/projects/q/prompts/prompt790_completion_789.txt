  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `null` !== `void 0` (a special value that is treated as undefined in JavaScript).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is also a falsy value, and `undefined` !== `void 0`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` (not a number) is a falsy value, and `NaN` !== `void 0`.

DONE.
