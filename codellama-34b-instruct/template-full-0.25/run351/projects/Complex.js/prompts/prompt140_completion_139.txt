  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if both the base and the exponent are infinite, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite']()) || (this['isInfinite']() && z['isNaN']())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also check if the base is infinite and the exponent is NaN, which is not checked in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(this['isInfinite']() && z['isZero']()) || (this['isZero']() && z['isInfinite
