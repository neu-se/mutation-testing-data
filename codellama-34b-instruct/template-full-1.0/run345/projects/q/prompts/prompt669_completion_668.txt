  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `call` are different methods in JavaScript, and using `call` instead of `apply` could result in the wrong `this` value being bound to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` and `apply` are different methods in JavaScript, and using `bind` instead of `apply` could result in the wrong `this` value being bound to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"POST"
```
This would result in different behavior because `POST` is a string literal, and using it as a method name would result in an error if the `dispatch` method is expecting a function as its first argument.

DONE.
