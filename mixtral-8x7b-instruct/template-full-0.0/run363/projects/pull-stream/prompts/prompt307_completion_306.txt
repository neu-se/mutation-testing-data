 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes only two arguments to the callback, while the modified one passes three. This could cause issues if the calling code is not prepared to handle the extra argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the error object as the first argument to the callback, while the modified one passes a boolean value. This could cause issues if the calling code is expecting an error object and tries to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(cb, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback synchronously, while the modified one calls it asynchronously using `setTimeout`. This could cause issues if the calling code relies on the callback being called synchronously.

DONE.
