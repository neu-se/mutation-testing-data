  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially breaking the code that relies on the function's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially breaking the code that relies on the function's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"parse" + "a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a different value, potentially breaking the code that relies on the function's output.

DONE.
