  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a different method than `match`, and it would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would match a different set of strings.

DONE.
