  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + '.' + options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and adding a string and an object property using the `+` operator would result in a concatenated string, which is not the expected behavior for the `readFileSync` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and calling the `toString()` method on a string would return the same string, which is not the expected behavior for the `readFileSync` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(file)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and calling the `JSON.stringify()` method on a string would return a JSON string representation of the string, which is not the expected behavior for the `readFileSync` method.

DONE.
