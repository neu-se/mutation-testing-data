 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would always start transforming at the beginning of the delta, regardless of the provided index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `transformPosition` method would use the first operation in the iterator instead of the current operation at the given index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index + offset
