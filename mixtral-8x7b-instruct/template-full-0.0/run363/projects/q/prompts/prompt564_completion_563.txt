 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Replacement error');
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an Error object instead of calling the `reject` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject('Replacement rejection');
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `Q.reject` function with a string instead of passing the exception to the `reject` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.reject('Replacement rejection');
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new Promise that is rejected with a string instead of passing the exception to the `reject` function.

DONE.
