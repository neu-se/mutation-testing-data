  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a && !onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression `a && !onEnd` would be evaluated first, and the `!onEnd` part would only be evaluated if `a` is truthy. This would cause the `onEnd` function to be called with a falsy value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!a || onEnd
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the expression `!a || onEnd` would be evaluated first, and the `onEnd` function would only be called if `a` is falsy. This would cause the `onEnd` function to be called with a truthy value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.
