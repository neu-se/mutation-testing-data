  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy (i.e., `null` or `undefined`), while this code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` is falsy, while this code fragment checks if its length is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.hasOwnProperty('current')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `timezonesMap` has a property called `current`, while this code fragment checks if the `timezonesMap` object has its own property called `current`.

DONE.
