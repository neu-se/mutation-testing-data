  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, errback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the callback and errback arguments is reversed, which could cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, callback, callback
```
This would result in different behavior because the errback argument is missing, which could cause the promise to be resolved instead of rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result.value, function () {}, function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback and errback arguments are replaced with empty functions, which could cause the promise to be resolved or rejected without any action being taken.

DONE.
