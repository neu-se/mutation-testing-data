 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index <= -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat an index of -1 as a valid index, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the `eachLine` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
index > this.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `eachLine` method to process indices that are out of bounds, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
