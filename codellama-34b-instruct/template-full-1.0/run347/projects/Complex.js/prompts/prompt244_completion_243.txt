  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function is being replaced with the `sin` function, which would cause the method to return the wrong value for the `exp` calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `a * Math.tan(b)` is not equivalent to `Math.cos`. The `tan` function has a different range of values than the `cos` function, and would cause the method to return a different value for the `exp` calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function expects two arguments, but only one is being provided. This would cause an error, and the method would not be able to return a value for the `exp` calculation.

DONE.
