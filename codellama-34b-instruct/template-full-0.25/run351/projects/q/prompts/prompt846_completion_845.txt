  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array argument have resolved, whereas `Q` returns a promise that resolves with the first promise in the array argument that resolves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.race()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.race()` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array argument resolves or rejects, whereas `Q` returns a promise that resolves with the first promise in the array argument that resolves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.any()` returns a promise that resolves with the first promise in the array argument that resolves, whereas `Q` returns a promise that resolves with the first promise in the array argument that resolves.

DONE.
