  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.bind(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to `resolvedPromise`, which may not be the same as the `this` context of the original `inspect` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.call(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes the `inspect` method with `resolvedPromise` as the `this` context, which may not be the same as the `this` context of the original `inspect` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.inspect.apply(resolvedPromise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` invokes the `inspect` method with `resolvedPromise` as the `this` context, which may not
