  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because if `nextOp` is null, then the code will throw a `TypeError` when trying to access its `length` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because if `nextOp` is undefined, then the code will return `Infinity` when trying to access its `length` property, which may not be desirable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because if `nextOp` has a length of 0, then the code will return `Infinity` when trying to access its `length` property, which may not be desirable.

DONE.
