  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude of the second point instead of the first point, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude instead of the longitude, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.longitude + Math.random()*100
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a random number to the longitude, leading to an incorrect calculation of the distance and bearing.

DONE.
