  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](z['re'] == 0 && z['im'] == 0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the denominator is zero, instead of returning `Complex['NAN']` as the original code does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](z['re'] != 0 || z['im'] != 0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would never return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the denominator is non-zero, regardless of the value of the numerator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (this['isInfinite'](z['re'] * z['im'] == 0)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the numerator is zero and
