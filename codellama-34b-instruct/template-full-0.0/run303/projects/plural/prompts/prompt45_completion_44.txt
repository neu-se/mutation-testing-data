  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different from the original, and it would match a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiouy]o$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different from the original, and it would match a different set of words.

```

DONE.
