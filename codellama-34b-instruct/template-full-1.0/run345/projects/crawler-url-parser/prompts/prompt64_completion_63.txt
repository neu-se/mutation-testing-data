  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.parse.foo
```
This would result in a TypeError because psl.parse is a function, and calling foo on a function will produce an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
psl.bar
```
This would result in an output of undefined because psl doesn't have a property called "bar".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cheerio.foo
```
This would result in an output of undefined because cheerio doesn't have a property called "foo".

DONE.
