  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] - this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would swap the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, which could cause the `equals` method to return false positives or false negatives.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers, which could cause the `equals` method to return false positives or false negatives.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real part of the first complex number by the imaginary part of the second complex number, which could cause the `equals` method to return false positives or false negatives.

DONE.
