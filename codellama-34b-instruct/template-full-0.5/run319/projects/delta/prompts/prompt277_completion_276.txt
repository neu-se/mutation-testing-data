  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the value of the next element in the iterator without advancing it, while `iter.next` returns the value of the current element and advances the iterator to the next element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.value
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the value of the next element in the iterator, while `iter.value` returns the value of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.key
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the value of the next element in the iterator, while `iter.key` returns the key of the current element.

DONE.
