  
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ses.notOk
```
This would result in different behavior because `ses.notOk` is a function that returns the opposite of `ses.ok`, which is a function that returns `true` if the given value is truthy and `false` otherwise. If `ses.notOk` is used in place of `ses.ok`, the test will pass if the value is falsy, which may not be the intended behavior.
