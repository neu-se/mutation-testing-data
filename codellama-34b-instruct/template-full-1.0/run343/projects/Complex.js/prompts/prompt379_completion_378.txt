  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 - Math.cos` is a different formula than `Math.cos` and would produce different results for some input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different formula than `Math.cos` and would produce different results for some input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` is a different formula than `Math.cos` and would produce different results for some input values.

DONE.
