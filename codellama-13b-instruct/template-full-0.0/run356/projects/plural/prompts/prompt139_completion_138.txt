  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would capitalize the first letter of the word, which would affect the pluralization rules.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the word, which would affect the pluralization rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `charAt()` method would return the first character of the word, which would affect the pluralization rules.

DONE.
