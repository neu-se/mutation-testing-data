  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number, which is always positive, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, which can be positive or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a number, which can be positive or negative, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, which can be positive or negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of a number, which can be any real number, while `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of a number, which can be any non-negative real number.

DONE.
