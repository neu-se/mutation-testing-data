 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat empty objects and null values differently than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof b !== 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not check if `b` is an object, but only if it is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow an object if it is an array, which is not the same as checking if it is an object.

These changes would potentially expose weaknesses in the test suite by introducing different behaviors that may not be covered by the existing tests. DONE.
