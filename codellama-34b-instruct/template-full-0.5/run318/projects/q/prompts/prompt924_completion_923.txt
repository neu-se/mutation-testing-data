  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.pop()` would remove the last element from the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be empty, and the `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)` line would fail because `nodeArgs` is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.shift()` would remove the first element from the `nodeArgs` array, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be empty, and the `Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject)` line would fail because `nodeArgs` is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nodeArgs.reverse()` would reverse the order of the elements in the `nodeArgs
