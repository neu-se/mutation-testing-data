  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` and `call` are different ways of invoking a function in JavaScript. `apply` invokes a function with a given `this` value and an array of arguments, while `call` invokes a function with a given `this` value and a list of arguments. In this case, using `call` instead of `apply` could cause the function to be invoked with the wrong arguments or context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke the function with an array of arguments instead of a list of arguments. This could cause the function to be invoked with the wrong arguments or context.
