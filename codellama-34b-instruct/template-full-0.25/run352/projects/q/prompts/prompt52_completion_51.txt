  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    process.nextTick(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a Node.js-specific function that is not available in the browser, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setTimeout(flush, 0);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a browser-specific function that is not available in Node.js, so the code would not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick = function () {
    setImmediate(flush);
};
```
This would result in different behavior because `setImmediate` is a browser-specific function that is not available in Node.js, so the code would not work as intended.

DONE.
