  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, while `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would result in a different angle for the sine and cosine functions, leading to different values for the complex exponential function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is not the same as `b`. The `sin` and `cos` functions would have different arguments, leading to different values for the complex exponential function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * b` is not the same as `b`. The `sin` and `cos` functions would have different arguments, leading to different values for the complex exponential function.

DONE.
