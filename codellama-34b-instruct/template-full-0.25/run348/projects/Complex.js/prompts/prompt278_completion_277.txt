  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable that represents the imaginary part of a complex number, while `b + 1` would be a different value that is not related to the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable that represents the imaginary part of a complex number, while `a + b` would be a different value that is not related to the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable that represents the imaginary part of a complex number, while `Math.sin(b)` would be a different value that is not related to the complex number.

DONE.
