Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]*?)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for matching zero or more characters (including none) between slashes, which means it could match empty segments, contrary to the original intention of requiring at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+|.*)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an alternative that matches any character (including slashes) after the first segment, which could lead to incorrect matches that include unwanted characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+{2,})'
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly specifies that there must be at least two characters between slashes, which would prevent valid single-character segments from being matched.

DONE.
