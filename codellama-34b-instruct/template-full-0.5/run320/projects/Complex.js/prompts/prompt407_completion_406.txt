  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the real part of the complex number, instead of the imaginary part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negative of the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x['im'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary part of the complex number plus 1.

DONE.
