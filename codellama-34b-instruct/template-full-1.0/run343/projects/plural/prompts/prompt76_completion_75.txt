  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' || 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the second string to be returned, even if the word is not 'die'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice' && 'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the second string to be returned only if the word is both 'dice' and 'die', which is never the case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the 's' to be concatenated to the word 'die' regardless of whether it is a valid plural form or not.

DONE.
