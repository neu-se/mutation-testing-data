  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['phi']
```
This change will cause the code to use the `phi` property instead of the `r` property, which may result in different behavior depending on the values of the `a` and `b` variables.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This change will cause the code to use the `abs` property instead of the `r` property, which may result in different behavior depending on the values of the `a` and `b` variables.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This change will cause the code to use the `arg` property instead of the `r` property, which may result in different behavior depending on the values of the `a` and `b` variables.

DONE.
