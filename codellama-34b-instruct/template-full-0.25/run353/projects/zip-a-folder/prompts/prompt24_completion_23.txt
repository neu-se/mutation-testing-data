  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'zip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'zip'` instead of `'tar'`, which would cause the archive to be created in a different format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'tar'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'tar'` instead of `'zip'`, which would cause the archive to be created in a different format.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format: 'gzip'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` option is set to `'gzip'` instead of `'tar'` or `'zip'`, which would cause the archive to be created in a different format.

DONE.
