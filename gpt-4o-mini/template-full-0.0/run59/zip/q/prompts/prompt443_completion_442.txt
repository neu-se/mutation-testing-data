Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unknown reason"
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reason for the unhandled rejection from the actual error reason to a static string, which could mislead developers about the nature of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `undefined` as the reason for the unhandled rejection, which may cause confusion and make it difficult to diagnose the issue since no meaningful information about the rejection is provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + " (additional context)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a string to the original reason, potentially altering the original error message and providing misleading information about the nature of the rejection.

DONE.
