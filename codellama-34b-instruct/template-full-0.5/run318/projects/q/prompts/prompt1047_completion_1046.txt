  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `error` parameter is not provided, while the new code fragment would simply return `null` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `error` parameter is not provided, while the new code fragment would simply return `undefined` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if the `error` parameter is not provided, while the new code fragment would simply return an empty object in that case.

DONE.
