  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error) {
    self.reject(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error, whereas the original code would only reject the promise if the resolvedPromise was already defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (error && resolvedPromise) {
    self.reject(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error only if the resolvedPromise was already defined, whereas the original code would reject the promise with the error regardless of whether the resolvedPromise was defined or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!error) {
    self.reject(error);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with the error only if the error was not defined, whereas the original code would reject the promise with the error regardless of whether the error was defined or not.
