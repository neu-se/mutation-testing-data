  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would return `true` if `b` is `null`, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would return `true` if `b` is an instance of `Object`, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(b)` would return `'[object Object]'` if `b` is an object, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` would return `false` in that case.

DONE.
