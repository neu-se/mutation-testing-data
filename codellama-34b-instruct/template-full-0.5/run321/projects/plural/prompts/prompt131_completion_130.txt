  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for regular expression rules, even if the word does not match the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of matches for regular expression rules, even if the word does not match the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word) && word.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` for regular expression rules if the word matches the rule and has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
