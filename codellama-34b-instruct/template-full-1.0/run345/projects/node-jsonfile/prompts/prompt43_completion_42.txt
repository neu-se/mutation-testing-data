  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` would be called on a string, rather than an object, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` would be called on an empty object, rather than the `obj` object, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj && "placeholder"
```
This would result in different behavior because `stringify` would be called on `obj` only if it is truthy, which would result in a different output if `obj` is falsy.

DONE.
