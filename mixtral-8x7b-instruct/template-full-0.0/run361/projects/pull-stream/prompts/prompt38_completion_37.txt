 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat.apply([], ref.slice(0, 4))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array using `concat` and `slice` instead of directly passing the first four elements of the `ref` array. This could cause issues if the code relies on the reference equality of the original array elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.slice(0, 4).join(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the first four elements of the `ref` array into a comma-separated string. This could cause issues if the code expects an array or if it relies on the original data types of the elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.filter(function(_, i) { return i < 4 }).map(function(e) { return e })
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array using `filter
