  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(b) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is being called with a different argument, which would change the resulting value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function is being called with a different argument, which would change the resulting value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is being called with a different argument, which would change the resulting value.

DONE.
