  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the callback function passed to the Node function would be the first argument instead of the last, which could cause the function to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In this case, the callback function passed to the Node function would be missing, which could cause the function to fail to execute the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.splice(0, 0, deferred.makeNodeResolver())
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice` adds an element at a specific index in an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end. In
