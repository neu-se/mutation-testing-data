  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
``` javascript
/^=\/\//, 'http://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=` character would be added at the beginning of the URL, which may cause the replace function to fail or modify the URL in an unexpected way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, 'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `https` protocol would be used instead of `http`, which may cause issues with certain websites or systems that do not support HTTPS.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/^\/\//, 'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ftp` protocol would be used instead of `http`, which may cause issues with file transfer operations or other functions that rely on the HTTP protocol.

DONE.
