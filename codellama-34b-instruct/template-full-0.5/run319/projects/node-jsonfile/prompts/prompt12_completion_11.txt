  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `null` as the default value when `options.reviver` is not provided, while the new code fragment uses `undefined`. This could cause issues in the `JSON.parse()` method, which expects a function as the reviver parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `null` as the default value when `options.reviver` is not provided, while the new code fragment uses an empty object. This could cause issues in the `JSON.parse()` method, which expects a function as the reviver parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options ? options.reviver : function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `null` as the default value when `options.re
