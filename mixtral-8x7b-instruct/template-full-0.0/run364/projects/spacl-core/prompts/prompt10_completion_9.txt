 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
version === '1' || version === '1.1' ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/ : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex pattern for version 1.1 is changed to match version 1, which may not catch the same edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
spec.match(version === '1' ? /[*+][^/]|[^/][*+]/ : /\*[^*/]|\+[^+/]|[^/*]\*|[^/+]\+|\*\*\*|\+\+\+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the spec string is not compared against the regex pattern for version 1.0 or version 1.1, which may not catch the
