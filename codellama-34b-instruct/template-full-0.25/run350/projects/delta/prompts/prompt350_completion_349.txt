  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `invert` method would be called on the `attributes` object, which would likely produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the `attributes` object, which would likely produce a different result than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys` method would be called on the `attributes` object, which would likely produce a different result than the original code fragment.

DONE.
