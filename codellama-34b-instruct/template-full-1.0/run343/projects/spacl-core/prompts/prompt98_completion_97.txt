  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property would be null, causing the `policy` variable to be undefined. The `policy.query()` method would then throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty string would be used instead of the `name` property. The `policy` variable would be undefined, causing the `policy.query()` method to throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property would be undefined, causing the `policy` variable to be undefined. The `policy.query()` method would then throw a TypeError.

DONE.
