Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to dispatch messages to the already resolved promise instead of the new promise, potentially leading to incorrect state handling and unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to call `promiseDispatch` on `null`, resulting in a runtime error instead of properly dispatching the messages to the new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `messages` array instead of the new promise, which would not be a valid target for the `promiseDispatch` method, leading to incorrect handling of the promise's state and messages.

DONE.
