 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * (y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns the absolute value of `y` multiplied by 1, instead of the absolute value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt(Math.abs(y))
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the square root of the absolute value of `y`, instead of the absolute value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(Math.log(Math.abs(y)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the exponential value of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `y`, instead of the absolute value of `b`.

DONE.
