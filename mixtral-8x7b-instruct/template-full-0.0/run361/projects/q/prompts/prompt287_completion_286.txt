 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is expected to be a function, but `new Date()` creates a new Date object, which would cause an error when trying to call it as a function in the line `defer(resolver)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is expected to be a function, but `null` is a special value that represents the absence of any object value, which would cause an error when trying to call it as a function in the line `defer(resolver)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer` is expected to be a function with a specific implementation, but `function() { return 42; }` is a different function that always returns the value `42`, which would cause the code to
