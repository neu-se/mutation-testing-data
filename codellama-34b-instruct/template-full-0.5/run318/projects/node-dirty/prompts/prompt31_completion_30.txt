  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, undefined, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would cause the `set` method to delete the key from the database, even if the `val` argument is not undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, null, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid value in JavaScript, and it would cause the `set` method to delete the key from the database, even if the `val` argument is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(key, 'null', cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because `'null'` is a string, and it would cause the `set` method to store the string `'null'` in the database, even if the `val` argument is not a string.

DONE.
