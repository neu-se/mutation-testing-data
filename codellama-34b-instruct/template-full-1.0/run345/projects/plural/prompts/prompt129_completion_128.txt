  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, causing the loop to skip every other iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be decremented instead of incremented, causing the loop to iterate in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` variable would be set to 0 on every iteration, causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
