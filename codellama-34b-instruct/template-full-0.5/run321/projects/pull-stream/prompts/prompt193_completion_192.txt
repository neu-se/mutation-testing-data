  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if it is falsy. If the `aborted` variable is a boolean, this change would cause the code to behave differently when it is set to `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if it is strictly equal to `true`. If the `aborted` variable is a boolean, this change would cause the code to behave differently when it is set to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `aborted` variable is truthy, while this new code fragment checks if it is not strictly equal to `false`. If the
