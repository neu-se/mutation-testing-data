  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err && err === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `err` is truthy, but not if it is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === 'true'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is a string that is equal to `'true'`, but not if it is a boolean that is strictly equal to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!err
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `err` is falsy, but not if it is strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
