  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in a syntax error because `deferred` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => deferred
```
This would result in a function that returns a promise that is not resolved or rejected, causing the promise chain to hang indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(err, value) => deferred
```
This would result in a function that takes error and value arguments but does not do anything with them, causing the promise chain to continue uninterrupted.

DONE.
