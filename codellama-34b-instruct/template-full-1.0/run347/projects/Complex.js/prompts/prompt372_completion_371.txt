  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation to have negative b, which would change the result of the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2*b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation to have double b, which would change the result of the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the calculation to have b added, which would change the result of the square root.

DONE.
