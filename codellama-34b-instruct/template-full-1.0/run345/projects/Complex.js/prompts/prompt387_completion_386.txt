  Option 1:
The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh
```
 This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator will negate the result of the `Math.cosh(a)` call, which is not what the original code does. The code should be using the `Math.cos(b)` function call instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary plus operator is unnecessary and would not affect the result of the division.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator is unnecessary and would not affect the result of the division.

DONE.
