This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a string literal, while the new code fragment is a variable name.

DONE.
