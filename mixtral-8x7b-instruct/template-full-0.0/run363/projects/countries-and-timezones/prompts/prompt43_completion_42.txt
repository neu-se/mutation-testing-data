 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: { ...buildCountry(data, id) } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the country object returned by `buildCountry` instead of directly assigning the result of `getCountry(id, options)`. This might cause issues if the original `getCountry` implementation modifies the returned object in some way, while the mutated version does not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: { ...data.countries[id] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the country object from the `data` object instead of calling `buildCountry` and `getCountry`. This might cause issues if the `buildCountry` function performs additional processing or transformations on the country data before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
prev, { [id]: { ...getCountry(id, options) } }
