  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any input `z` that is infinite, instead of only returning `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this` is infinite and `z` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['ZERO']` for any input `z` that is zero, instead of only returning `Complex['ZERO']` when `this` is zero and `z` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` or `Comple
