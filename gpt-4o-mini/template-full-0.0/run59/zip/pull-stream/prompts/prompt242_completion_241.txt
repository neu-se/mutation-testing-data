Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument passed to the callback `cb` from `data` to `null`, which may lead to incorrect handling of the data in the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, end
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the arguments passed to the callback `cb`, which could cause the callback to interpret the parameters incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, data
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the first argument `end` with `undefined`, which may cause the callback to behave differently, especially if it relies on the first argument being a specific value (like an error or a termination signal).

DONE.
