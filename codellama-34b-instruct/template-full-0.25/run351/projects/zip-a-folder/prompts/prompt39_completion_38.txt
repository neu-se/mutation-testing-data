  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first element of the split array, whereas the original code fragment considers all elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider all elements except the first, whereas the original code fragment considers all elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider only non-empty elements, whereas the original code fragment considers all elements.

DONE.
