  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is inside a `try` block, which means that it will only be executed if an exception is thrown. However, the new code fragment `return reject(exception);` is not inside a `try` block, so it will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return resolve(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `return reject(exception);` is inside a `try` block, which means that it will only be executed if an exception is thrown. However, the new code fragment `return resolve(exception);` is not inside a `try` block, so it will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. Additionally, the new code fragment will resolve the promise with the exception, whereas the original code fragment will reject the promise with the exception.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
