  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the current operation to the delta, which would change the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the other operation to the delta, which would change the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push a new operation to the delta, which would change the resulting delta.

DONE.
