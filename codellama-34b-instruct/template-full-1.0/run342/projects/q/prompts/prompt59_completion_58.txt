  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `window` object is not always undefined, and this code fragment would evaluate to `false` even if `window` is defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process` object is not always defined, and this code fragment would evaluate to `true` even if `process` is not defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof setTimeout !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is not always defined, and this code fragment would evaluate to `true` even if `setTimeout` is not defined.

DONE.
