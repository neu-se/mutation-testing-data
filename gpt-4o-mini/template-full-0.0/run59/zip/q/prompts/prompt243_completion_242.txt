Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `inspect` function to return the state of the `resolvedPromise` when it is actually still pending, leading to incorrect state reporting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!messages
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there are no messages instead of checking if the promise has been resolved, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promise state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only check if `resolvedPromise` is strictly `undefined`, which could lead to incorrect behavior if `resolvedPromise` is set to `null` or another falsy value, thus misrepresenting the promise's resolution state.

DONE.
