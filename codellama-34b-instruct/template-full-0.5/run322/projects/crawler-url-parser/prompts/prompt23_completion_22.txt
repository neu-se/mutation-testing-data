Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not remove the fragment identifier from the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression pattern is different, and it would not remove the fragment identifier from the URL.
