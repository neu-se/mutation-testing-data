  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i - 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would be called with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to a different return value.

DONE.
