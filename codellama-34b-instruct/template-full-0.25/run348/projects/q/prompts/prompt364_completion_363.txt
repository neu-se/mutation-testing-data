  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `null` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method would be called with the string "hello" as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value "hello".

DONE.
