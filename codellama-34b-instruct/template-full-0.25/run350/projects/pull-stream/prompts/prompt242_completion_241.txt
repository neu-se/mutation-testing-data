  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would negate the value of `data`. If `data` is truthy, the resulting value would be `false`, and if `data` is falsy, the resulting value would be `true`. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is an addition operator, which would add 1 to the value of `data`. This would cause the `if` statement to behave differently than it would with the original code fragment, especially if `data` is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.length` property is a property of arrays and strings, and it returns the length of the array
