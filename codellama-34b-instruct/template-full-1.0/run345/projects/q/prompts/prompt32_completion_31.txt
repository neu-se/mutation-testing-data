  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(laterQueue[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the first task in the `laterQueue` instead of executing `task`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(laterQueue.pop());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute the last task in the `laterQueue` instead of executing `task`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
runSingle(Math.floor(Math.random() * laterQueue.length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would execute a random task from the `laterQueue` instead of executing `task`.

DONE.
