  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'geese' when the word is 'goose', while this code fragment returns 'goose' regardless of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gooses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'geese' when the word is 'goose', while this code fragment returns 'gooses' regardless of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goose' + 's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns 'geese' when the word is 'goose', while this code fragment returns 'gooses' regardless of the word.

DONE.
