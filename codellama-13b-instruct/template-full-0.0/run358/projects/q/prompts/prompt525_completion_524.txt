  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"isDef"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a property named "isDef" on the object, while the new code fragment is a string literal. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError when it tries to access the "isDef" property on the object, since it is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"isDef()"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a property named "isDef" on the object, while the new code fragment is a function call. This would cause the code to throw a TypeError when it tries to access the "isDef" property on the object, since it is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"isDef"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to a property named "isDef" on the object, while the new code fragment is a string literal.
