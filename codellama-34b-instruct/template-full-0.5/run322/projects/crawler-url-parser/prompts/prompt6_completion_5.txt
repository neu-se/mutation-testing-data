  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string contains illegal characters, while the modified code fragment checks if the reversed string contains illegal characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string contains illegal characters, while the modified code fragment checks if the lowercase version of the string contains illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace('://', '://www.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string contains illegal characters, while the modified code fragment checks if the string contains illegal characters after adding "www." to the beginning of the URL.

DONE.
