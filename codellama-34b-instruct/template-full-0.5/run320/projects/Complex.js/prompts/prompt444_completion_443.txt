  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places || 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 1 if places is falsy, instead of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 if places is truthy, instead of 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0, regardless of the value of places.

DONE.
