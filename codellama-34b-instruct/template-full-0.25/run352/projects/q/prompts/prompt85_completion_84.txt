  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called with an undefined argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called with a null argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestTick(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `requestTick` function to be called with a zero argument, which could potentially cause an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
