  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is not called on the original promise, so the promise returned by `reject` would not be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is not called on the original promise, so the promise returned by `reject` would not be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finally` method is not called on the original promise, so the promise returned by `reject` would not be rejected.

DONE.
