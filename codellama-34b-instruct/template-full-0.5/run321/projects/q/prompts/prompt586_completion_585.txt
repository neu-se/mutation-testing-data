  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called twice, which could have unintended consequences if it has side effects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with a null argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)("foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would be called with a string argument, which could cause it to behave differently.

DONE.
