  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `RegExpMatchArray` returned by the `[Symbol.match]` method would have a length of 1, which would cause the function to return early without checking for malformed captures.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `RegExpMatchArray` returned by the `[Symbol.match]` method would have a length of 0, which would cause the function to return early without checking for malformed captures.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `RegExpMatchArray` returned by the `[Symbol.match]` method would have a length of 1, and the first element would be `NaN`, which would cause the function to return early without checking for malformed captures.

DONE.
