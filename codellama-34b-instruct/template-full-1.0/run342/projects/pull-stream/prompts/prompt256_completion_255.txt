  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream).filter(x => x > 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method would filter out any elements in the stream that are less than or equal to 1, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream).map(x => x * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map()` method would double the value of all elements in the stream, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream = values(stream).flat()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flat()` method would flatten the stream, but the original code expects the stream to be a stream of arrays or streams.

DONE.
