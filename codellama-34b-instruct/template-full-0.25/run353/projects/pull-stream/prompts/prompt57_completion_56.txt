  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as is, while this new code fragment pushes the item plus 1, which could result in a different array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as is, while this new code fragment pushes the item multiplied by 2, which could result in a different array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.push(item.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pushed the item as is, while this new code fragment pushes the name of the item, which could result in a different array.

DONE.
