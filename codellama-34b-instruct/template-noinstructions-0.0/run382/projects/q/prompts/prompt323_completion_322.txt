  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `args` argument to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `args` array to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the second element of the `args` array to the `promiseDispatch` method, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
