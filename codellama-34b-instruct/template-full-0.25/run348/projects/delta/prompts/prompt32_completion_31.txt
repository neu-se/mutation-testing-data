  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base
```
This would result in different behavior because `base` is an object, and `attr` is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attr[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `attr[key]` is a string, and `base` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because `base[key]` is a string, and `attr` is an object.

DONE.
