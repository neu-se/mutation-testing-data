  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return a delta with the same ops as the original delta, instead of concatenating the ops with the other delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.rest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return a delta with the same ops as the other delta, instead of concatenating the ops with the original delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `concat` method to return an empty delta, instead of concatenating the ops with the other delta.

DONE.
