  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with any parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, void 0, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because void 0 is not the same as null or undefined, and the callback would be called with the value three.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello", 3, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with the string "hello" and the number 3, which is not the same as no arguments.

DONE.
