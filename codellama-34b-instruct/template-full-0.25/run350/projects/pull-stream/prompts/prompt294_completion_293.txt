  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `data` instead of `err` or `true`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` instead of `data`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` instead of `data`, which could cause the program to behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
