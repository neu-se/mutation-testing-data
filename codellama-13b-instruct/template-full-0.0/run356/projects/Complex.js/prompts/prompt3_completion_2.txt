  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.exp` function is used to calculate the exponential of a number, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Math.pow` function to calculate the exponential of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function is used to calculate the exponential of a number, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function to calculate the exponential of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.log` function is used to calculate the logarithm of a number, whereas the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function to calculate the exponential of a number.

DONE.
