  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` if the `_queue` is not empty, while this new code fragment would call `_flush` regardless of whether the `_queue` is empty or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` with no arguments, while this new code fragment would call `_flush` with the `key` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(val);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `_flush` with no arguments, while this new code fragment would call `_flush` with the `val` argument.

DONE.
