  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `typeof window` is not `"undefined"`, which means it is in a Node.js environment. However, this replacement would cause the code to assume it is not in a Node.js environment, which could result in unexpected behavior if it is actually run in a Node.js environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `typeof window` is not `"undefined"`, which means it is in a Node.js environment. However, this replacement would cause the code to assume it is not in a Node.js environment, which could result in unexpected behavior if it is actually run in a Node.js environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof window !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `typeof window` is not `"
