  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the progress notification to be sent with an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the progress notification to be sent with an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` function would be called with an incorrect argument, causing the progress notification to be sent with an incorrect value.

DONE.
