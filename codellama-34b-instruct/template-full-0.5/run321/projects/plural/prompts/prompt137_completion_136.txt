  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the `rule` array, which is a regular expression, instead of the second element, which is a string or a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the second element of the `rule` array, which is a string, but with all letters in uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the second element of the `rule` array, which is a string, instead of the string or function itself.

DONE.
