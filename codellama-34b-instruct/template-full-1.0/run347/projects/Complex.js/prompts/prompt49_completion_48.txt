  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isFinite` method checks whether a number is finite or infinite, and it returns `true` if the number is finite and `false` if it is infinite. In the original code, the `Number.isFinite` method is called on `a['abs']` and `a['arg']`, which are both numbers. If either of these numbers is infinite, the method will return `false`, which will cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to be executed.

However, if we replace `Number.isFinite` with `Number.isFinite(a['abs']) && Number.isFinite(a['arg'])`, the code fragment will check whether both `a['abs']` and `a['arg']` are finite. If either of these numbers is infinite, the entire expression will evaluate to `false`, which will cause the `return Complex['INFINITY']` statement to
