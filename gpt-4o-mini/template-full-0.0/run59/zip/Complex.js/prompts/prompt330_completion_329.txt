Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being used in the calculation, potentially leading to incorrect results for the cosecant function, as it would incorrectly modify the imaginary part of the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the value of `b`, which would affect the calculation of the imaginary part of the cosecant function, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it halves the value of `b`, which would alter the calculation of the imaginary part of the cosecant function, resulting in a different output than intended.

DONE.
