  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.insert) {
  inverted.insert(Op.length(thisOp));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code block retains the inserted string, while the modified code block inserts the length of the inserted string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.insert) {
  inverted.delete(Op.length(thisOp));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code block retains the inserted string, while the modified code block deletes the length of the inserted string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (thisOp.insert) {
  inverted.retain(Op.length(thisOp) + 1);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code block retains the inserted string, while the modified code block retains the length of the inserted string plus one.

DONE.
