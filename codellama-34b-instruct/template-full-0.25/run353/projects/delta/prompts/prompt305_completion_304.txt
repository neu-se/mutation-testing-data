  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the line length is greater than 0, but this replacement would check if the line length is less than 0, which would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the line length is greater than 0, but this replacement would check if the line length is equal to 0, which would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the line length is greater than 0, but this replacement would check if the line length plus 1 is greater than 0, which would cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
