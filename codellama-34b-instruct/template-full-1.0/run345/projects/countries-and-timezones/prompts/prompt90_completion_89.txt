  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, { deprecated: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return timezones that have not been deprecated, while the original code would return all timezones regardless of their deprecation status.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzName, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return deprecated timezones, while the original code would return all timezones regardless of their deprecation status.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`${tzName}foobar`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different timezone name than the original code, which would likely cause the tests to fail.

DONE.
