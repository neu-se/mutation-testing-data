  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER in the method `calculateDestination()` can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * distance
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce randomness into the `distance` calculation, which could lead to unexpected results in the rest of the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER in the method `calculateDestination()` can be replaced with:
```
distance + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increase the value of `distance`, which could cause the method to return a different destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER in the method `calculateDestination()` can be replaced with:
```
distance - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrease the value of `distance`, which could cause the method to return a different destination point.

DONE.
