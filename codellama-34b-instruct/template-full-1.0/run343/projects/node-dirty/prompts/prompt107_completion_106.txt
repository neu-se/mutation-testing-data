  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val, row.val
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the same value to both the key and the value of the object, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, row.val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the object by 1, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign null to the value of the object, which is not what the original code fragment does.

DONE.
