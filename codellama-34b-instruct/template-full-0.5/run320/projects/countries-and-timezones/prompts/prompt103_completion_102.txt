  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the current timezone object to the previous object, rather than assigning it as a new property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] = tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the current timezone object to the previous object, rather than adding it as a new property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev[key] += tzs[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the current timezone object to the previous object, rather than assigning it as a new property.

DONE.
