  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would return the next operation in the other iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` would return the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(2)` would return the next two operations in the other iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` would return the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(otherIter.peekLength())` would return the next operation in the other iterator, whereas `otherIter.next` would return the next operation.

DONE.
