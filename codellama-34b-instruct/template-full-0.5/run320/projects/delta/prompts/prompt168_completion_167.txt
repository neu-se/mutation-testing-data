  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration over the `other` Delta's ops to advance, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration over the `this` Delta's ops to terminate prematurely, potentially missing important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iteration over the `this` Delta's ops to advance to the next retain operation, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
