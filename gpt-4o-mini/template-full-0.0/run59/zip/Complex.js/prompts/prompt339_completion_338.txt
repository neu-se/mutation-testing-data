Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 || b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if either `a` or `b` is not zero, which would incorrectly trigger the condition when either part of the complex number is non-zero, leading to a different execution path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 1 && b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it specifically checks for the case where both `a` and `b` are equal to 1, which is a much narrower condition than the original check for both being zero, potentially causing unexpected results for other complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` equals zero, which does not necessarily mean that both `a` and `b` are zero, thus allowing for cases where the condition is true even when the complex number is not the origin.

DONE.
