  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 1, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the index of the splice operation would be off by one, causing the newOp to be inserted at the wrong position in the ops array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp would be inserted twice into the ops array, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index, 0, newOp, newOp, newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because the newOp would be inserted three times into the ops array, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
