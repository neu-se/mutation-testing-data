  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is taking the wrong arguments, and would hence produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is taking the wrong arguments, and would hence produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is taking the wrong arguments, and would hence produce incorrect results.

DONE.
