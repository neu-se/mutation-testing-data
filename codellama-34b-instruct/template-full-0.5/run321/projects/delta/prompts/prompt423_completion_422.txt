  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is reversed, potentially causing the resulting index to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - index + offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is reversed and the subtraction is changed to addition, potentially causing the resulting index to be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length - index
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is reversed and the subtraction is changed to addition, potentially causing the resulting index to be different from the original.

DONE.
