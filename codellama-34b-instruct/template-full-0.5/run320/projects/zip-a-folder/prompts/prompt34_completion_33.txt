  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function is called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the promise to resolve instead of rejecting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', output.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.end()` function is called instead of the `reject` function, which would cause the output stream to be ended instead of rejecting the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', throw new Error('Error message')
```
This would result in different behavior because a new error is thrown instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the program to crash.

DONE.
