  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clone
```
This would result in different behavior because `clone` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep(null)` would return `null`, whereas `cloneDeep` would return a deep copy of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cloneDeep(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cloneDeep(undefined)` would return `undefined`, whereas `cloneDeep` would return a deep copy of the object.

DONE.
