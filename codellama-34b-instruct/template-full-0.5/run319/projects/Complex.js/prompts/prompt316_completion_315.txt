  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` is the real part. Using `b` instead of `a` would result in a different calculation for the sine and cosine of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` is the sum of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `a` and `b` are the individual parts. Using `a + b` instead of `a` and `b` separately would result in a different calculation for the sine and cosine of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * b` is the product of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, while `a` and `b` are the individual parts. Using `a * b
