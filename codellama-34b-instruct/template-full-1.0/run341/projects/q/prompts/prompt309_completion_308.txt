  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` function would return a resolved promise with `null` as its value, instead of a rejected promise with the original reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` function would return a resolved promise with `undefined` as its value, instead of a rejected promise with the original reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("something went wrong")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` function would throw an error instead of returning a rejected promise with the original reason.

DONE.
