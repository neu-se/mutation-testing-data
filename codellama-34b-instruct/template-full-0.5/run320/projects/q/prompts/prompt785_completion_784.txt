  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { throw error; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws the error if the promise is rejected, while this new code fragment would throw the error regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { console.log(error); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error, while this new code fragment would only log the error to the console.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (error) { return Q.reject(error); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error, while this new code fragment would return a rejected promise with the error as the reason.

DONE.
