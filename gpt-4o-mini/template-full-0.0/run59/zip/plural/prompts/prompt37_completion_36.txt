Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index|s$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly adds a rule that matches any word ending with 's', which would cause it to apply the pluralization rule to a broader set of words than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ices' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logic to remove only the last character instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "appendix" and "index".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w + 's' });
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly pluralizes "appendix" and "index" by simply appending 's', which is not the correct plural form for these words
