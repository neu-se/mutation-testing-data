  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(process.stdout)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the `stream` object, while this new code fragment pipes the `stream` object to `process.stdout`, which would cause the stream to be consumed and potentially modify the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a stream object, while this new code fragment returns `null`, which would cause an error to be thrown when the `read` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment expects a stream object, while this new code fragment returns `undefined`, which would cause an error to be thrown when the `read` function is called.

DONE.
