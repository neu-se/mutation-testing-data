  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _rejected("different exception")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different exception than the original `_rejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _rejected("different exception", "different reason")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different exception and reason than the original `_rejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return _rejected(new Error("different exception"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different exception than the original `_rejected` function.

DONE.
