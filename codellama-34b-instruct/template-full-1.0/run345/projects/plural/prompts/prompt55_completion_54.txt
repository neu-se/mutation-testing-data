  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(new RegExp('ves$'), 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` with a string as the first argument only replaces the first occurrence, while `regexp.replace` replaces all occurences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because `regexp` is not a string, and `replace` with a non-string first argument will cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace('ves', 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` with a string as the first argument will only replace the first occurrence, while `regexp.replace` replaces all occurrences.

DONE.
