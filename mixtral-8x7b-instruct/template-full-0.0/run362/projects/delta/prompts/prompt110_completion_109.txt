 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat the absence of `op` as an empty object, potentially causing unexpected results in the predicate function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the first operation in the `ops` array, regardless of the current index, potentially causing incorrect filtering or iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{} as Op
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the `op` to be treated as an object with an empty type, potentially causing unexpected results in the predicate function.

DONE.
