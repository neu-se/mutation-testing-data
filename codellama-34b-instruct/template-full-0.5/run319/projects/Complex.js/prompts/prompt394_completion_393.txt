  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the negative sign would cause the result to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be off by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*a
```
This would result in different behavior because the result would be a square.

DONE.
