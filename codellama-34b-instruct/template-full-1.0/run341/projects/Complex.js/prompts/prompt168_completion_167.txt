  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the replaced code checks if both `z.re` and `z.im` are zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, while the replaced code checks if `z.re` is equal to `Infinity`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the replaced code checks if `z.re` is a NaN.

DONE.
