  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(offset / 60) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rounds down to the nearest hour, while this modified code rounds up to the nearest hour. This could cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rounds down to the nearest hour, while this modified code rounds up to the nearest hour. This could cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(offset / 60)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code rounds down to the nearest hour, while this modified code rounds to the nearest hour. This could cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.

DONE.
