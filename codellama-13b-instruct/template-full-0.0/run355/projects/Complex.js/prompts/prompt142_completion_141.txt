  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>) && z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is called with a different argument than the original code, and the `isZero` method is called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
