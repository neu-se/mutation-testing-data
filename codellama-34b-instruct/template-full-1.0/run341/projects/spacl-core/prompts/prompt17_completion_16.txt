  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return third_party.compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different compiler, which could have different rules for wildcards and other syntax elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new RegExp(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `RegExp` class to create the regex, which could have different rules for syntax and would not include the `compile` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return spec
```
This would result in different behavior because it would simply return the original input string, without compiling it into a regex.

DONE.
