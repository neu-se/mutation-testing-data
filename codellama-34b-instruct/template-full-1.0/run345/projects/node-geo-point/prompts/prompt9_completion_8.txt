  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `null`
```
if (point.type !== 'Point') {
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value for the `type` property, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "string".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `undefined`
```
if (point.type !== 'Point') {
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid value for the `type` property, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "string".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with `NaN`
```
if (point.type !== 'Point') {
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not a valid value for the `type` property, so the `typeof` operator would return "object" instead of "string".

DONE.
