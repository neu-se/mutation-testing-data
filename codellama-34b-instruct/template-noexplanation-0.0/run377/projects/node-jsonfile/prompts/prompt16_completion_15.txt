  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This change will cause the `readFile` function to call the `writeFile` function instead of the `_readFile` function, which will result in the `readFile` function writing to the file instead of reading from it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This change will cause the `readFile` function to call the `readFileSync` function instead of the `_readFile` function, which will result in the `readFile` function reading from the file synchronously instead of asynchronously.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This change will cause the `readFile` function to call the `writeFileSync` function instead of the `_readFile` function, which will result in the `readFile` function writing to the file synchronously instead of asynchronously.

DONE.
