  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "tiger" is not present in the original code fragment, so it would not be recognized as a singular noun that should be pluralized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|halibut|moose|sheep|tiger|zebra)\b/i, function(w) { return w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new word "zebra" is not present in the original code fragment, so it would not be recognized as a singular noun that should be pluralized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:bison|cod|deer|fowl|
