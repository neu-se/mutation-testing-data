  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method, while the original code fragment only accessed the `inspect` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method with a `true` argument, while the original code fragment did not pass any arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method with a `false` argument, while the original code fragment did not pass any arguments.

DONE.
