  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move one step further than it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(end - index + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move one step further than it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index + 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move two steps further than it should, potentially skipping over important operations.

DONE.
