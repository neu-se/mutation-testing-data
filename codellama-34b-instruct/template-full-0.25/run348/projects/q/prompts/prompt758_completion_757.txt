  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allFulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allFulfilled" is not a valid method of the Q library, and would cause an error if used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"anyRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "anyRejected" is not a valid method of the Q library, and would cause an error if used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"allRejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because "allRejected" is not a valid method of the Q library, and would cause an error if used.

DONE.
