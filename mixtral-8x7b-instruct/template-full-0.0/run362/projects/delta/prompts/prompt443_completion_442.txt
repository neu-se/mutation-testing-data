 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nextOp.insert.length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned substring length is now determined by the length of the `insert` property instead of the specified `length` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns a single character from the `insert` property, regardless of the specified `length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.min(nextOp.insert.length - offset, length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it limits the returned substring length to the remaining length of the `insert` property, instead of the specified `length`.

DONE.
