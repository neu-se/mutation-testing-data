 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => done()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `done` directly, while the mutated code wraps `done` in an arrow function, potentially changing the context in which `done` is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done.bind(null)
