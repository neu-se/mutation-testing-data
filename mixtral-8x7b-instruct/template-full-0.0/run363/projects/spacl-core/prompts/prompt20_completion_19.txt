 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.concat(string,'').endsWith
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the string to a non-empty string using concat, which could lead to false positives in the match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
string.slice(-1) === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the last character is a slash, rather than checking if the string ends with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
string.indexOf('/', string.length - 1) !== -1
