  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack line, which may not be the file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second word of the stack line, which may not be the file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the third word of the stack line, which may not be the file name and line number.

DONE.
