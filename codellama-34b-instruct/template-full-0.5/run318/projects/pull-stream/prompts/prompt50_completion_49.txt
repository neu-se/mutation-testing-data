  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s instanceof Function` checks if `s` is an instance of the built-in `Function` class, while `typeof s === 'function'` checks if `s` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.constructor === Function` checks if `s` is an instance of a class that inherits from the built-in `Function` class, while `typeof s === 'function'` checks if `s` is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.prototype.constructor === Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.prototype.constructor === Function` checks if `s` is an instance of a class that inherits from a class that inherits from the built-in `Function` class, while `typeof s === 'function'` checks if `s` is a function.
