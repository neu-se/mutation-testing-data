  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options ? options.reviver : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error if the `reviver` option is not a function, whereas the original code would simply pass `null` to the `reviver` parameter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options ? options.reviver : undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error if the `reviver` option is not a function, whereas the original code would simply pass `undefined` to the `reviver` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options ? options.reviver : {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `JSON.parse` method to throw an error if the `reviver`
