 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
setTimeout(function () { resolve(result); }, 0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces a delay in resolving the promise, which could cause tests to fail if they rely on the promise being resolved synchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reject(result);
```
This would result in different behavior because it rejects the promise instead of resolving it, which could cause tests to fail if they expect the promise to be resolved with a certain value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('An error occurred');
