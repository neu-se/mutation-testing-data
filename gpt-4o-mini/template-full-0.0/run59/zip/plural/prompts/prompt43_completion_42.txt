Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove only the last character of the word instead of the last two characters, leading to incorrect pluralization for words like "index" which should become "indices".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last three characters of the word, which would incorrectly pluralize words like "appendix" to "appendi" instead of "appendices".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access an index that is out of bounds, leading to an error or unexpected behavior when trying to pluralize words, as it would not correctly reference any part of the string.

DONE.
