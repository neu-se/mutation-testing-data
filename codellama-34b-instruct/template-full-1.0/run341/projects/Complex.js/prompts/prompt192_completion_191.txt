  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether `b` is zero before proceeding with the calculation, while `a` might not be zero, leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code multiplies the result by `a`, while this new code multiplies the result by `a * b`, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code divides the result by `b`, while this new code divides the result by `a`, leading to a different result.

DONE.
