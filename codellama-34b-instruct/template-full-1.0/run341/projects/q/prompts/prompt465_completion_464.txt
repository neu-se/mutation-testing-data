  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` and `unhandledRejections` are different arrays containing different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because `reportedUnhandledRejections` and `unhandledReasons` are used for different purposes, the former is used to track unhandled rejections and the latter is used to track reasons for unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`Promise.resolve(process.on("unhandledRejection"))`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not use the `process.on("unhandledRejection")` event for tracking unhandled rejections, instead it would create a new promise that resolves to the `process.on("unhandledRejection")` event.

DONE.
