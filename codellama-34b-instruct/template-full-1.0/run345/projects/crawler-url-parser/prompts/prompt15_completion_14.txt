  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#./$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `/#/` portion of the regular expression would match any character, including digits, instead of only matching the pound sign (`#`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.*/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would only match URLs that contain at least one letter or digit, whereas the original regular expression would match any URL that contains a pound sign (`#`) followed by any number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` character at the beginning of the regular expression would force the regular expression to only match URLs that start with a pound sign (`#`) and end with the end of the URL, whereas the original regular expression would match any URL that contains a pound sign (`#`) anywhere in the URL.
