  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a way to represent `undefined` in JavaScript, but it is not a reference to the `rejection` variable, which is what is expected in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of any object value, but it is not a reference to the `rejection` variable, which is what is expected in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents a boolean true value, but it is not a reference to the `rejection` variable, which is what is expected in this context.

DONE.
