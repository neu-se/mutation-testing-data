  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the length of the retained operation, regardless of whether it is a delete operation or not. In the original code, the `thisOp.delete` only returns the length of the delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the delete operation instead of returning the length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the retained operation minus 1, regardless of whether it is a delete operation or not.

DONE.
