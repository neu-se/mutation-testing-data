  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
exception.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception.message` is a string, whereas `exception` is an object. In the original code, `exception` is an error object that is propagated to the next step of the promise chain, but `exception.message` is just a string that does not have the same properties and methods as an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\"" + exception + "\""
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `exception` object in a string, which changes its type and makes it incompatible with the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the `exception` object with `undefined`, which changes the behavior of the code and may cause unexpected errors.

DONE.
