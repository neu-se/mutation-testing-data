Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `mapper` function is expected to transform the data in a user-defined way, while this change will always double the input data, potentially leading to incorrect results if the intended transformation is not multiplication.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return data + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `mapper` function is meant to apply a specific transformation, while this change will always increment the input data by one, which may not align with the intended mapping logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (data) { return null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `mapper` function is expected to return a transformed value based on the input data, while this change will always return `null`, leading to loss of the actual data being processed.

DONE.
