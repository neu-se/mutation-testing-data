  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i.test(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now being tested against a number instead of a string, which would likely result in an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i.test(w)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now being tested against a different variable (w) instead of the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i.test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now being tested against a different variable (word) instead of the original string.

DONE.
