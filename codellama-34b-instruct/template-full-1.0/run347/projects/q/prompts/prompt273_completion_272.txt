  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` function would always receive a truthy value, regardless of the actual progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` function would always receive a falsy value, regardless of the actual progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `notify` function would always receive an undefined value, regardless of the actual progress.

DONE.
