  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `Symbol.match` method on the `super` object, while the new code fragment would create a new function and return it without calling any methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.hasOwnProperty(Symbol.match)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `Symbol.match` property is defined on the `super` object, while the new code fragment would check if the `Symbol.match` property is own property of the `super` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.constructor.prototype.match()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `Symbol.match` method on the `super` object's `constructor` prototype, while the new code fragment would call the `match` method on the `super` object's `constructor` prototype's `prototype` property
