  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to skip the next token, potentially resulting in a different parse tree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to use the previous token, potentially resulting in a different parse tree.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the parser to use twice the value of the next token, potentially resulting in a different parse tree.

DONE.
