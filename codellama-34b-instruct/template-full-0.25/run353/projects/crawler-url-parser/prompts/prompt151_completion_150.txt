  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host != pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the hostnames of the two URLs are equal, while this new code fragment checks if they are not equal. This would cause the function to return "internal" for URLs with different hostnames, even if they are not actually internal links.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.hostname != pageurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the hostnames of the two URLs are equal, while this new code fragment checks if their hostnames are not equal. This would cause the function to return "internal" for URLs with different hostnames, even if they are not actually internal links.
