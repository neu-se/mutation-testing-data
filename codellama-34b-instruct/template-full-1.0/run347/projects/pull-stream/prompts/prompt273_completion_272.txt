  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream + ''
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this new code fragment coerces `stream` into a string and always returns `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.constructor.name === 'Function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this new code fragment checks if `stream` is an instance of the `Function` constructor.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `stream` is a function, while this new code fragment calls `stream` as a function and returns its result.

DONE.
