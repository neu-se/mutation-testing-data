  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the boolean value of the `obj` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"obj"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the `obj` variable to a string, rather than leaving it as an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
++obj
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the value of the `obj` variable by 1, rather than leaving it unchanged.

DONE.
