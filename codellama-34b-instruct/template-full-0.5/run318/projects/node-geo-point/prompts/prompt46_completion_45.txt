  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = acos(r > 1 ? 1 : r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the angle from degrees to radians, but the replacement code fragment uses the `acos` function to calculate the arccosine of the angle, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = sin(r > 1 ? 1 : r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the angle from degrees to radians, but the replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of the angle, which would result in a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ2 = cos(r > 1 ? 1 : r)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function
