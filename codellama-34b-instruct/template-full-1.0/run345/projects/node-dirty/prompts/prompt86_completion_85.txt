  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because `*` is a wildcard character that matches any sequence of characters, which would lead to false positives in the parsing process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '
```
This would result in different behavior because ` ` is a single space character, which would likely cause the parsing process to fail due to the unexpected character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'John Doe'
```
This would result in different behavior because "John Doe" is a string literal that contains multiple characters, which would likely cause the parsing process to fail due to the unexpected characters.

DONE.
