Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` instead of `onAbort`, which means that the abort callback will not have the intended abort functionality, potentially leading to unhandled abort scenarios.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, true, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `true` instead of `abort`, which may cause the abort callback to be invoked incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior in the handling of the abort condition.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `cb` instead of `onAbort`, which could lead to recursive calls or incorrect handling of the abort logic, potentially causing a stack overflow or infinite loop.

DONE.
