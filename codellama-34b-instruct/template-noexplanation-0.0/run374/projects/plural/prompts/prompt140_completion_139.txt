  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This change will cause the function to return the second element of the `rule` array, which is the plural form of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0] + 's'
```
This change will cause the function to return the first element of the `rule` array, which is the singular form of the word, followed by the letter 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word + 's'
```
This change will cause the function to return the original word, followed by the letter 's'.

DONE.
