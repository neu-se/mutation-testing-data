  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(this['re'] * this['re'] + this['im'] * this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the Euclidean norm of the complex number instead of the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['re'] + this['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the squared absolute value of the complex number instead of the absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(this['re']) + Math.abs(this['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts instead of the absolute value of the complex number.

DONE.
