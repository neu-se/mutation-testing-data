  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { throw new Error("intentional error"); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning the resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.reject(new Error("intentional error")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a rejected promise instead of a resolved one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(value).then(function() { return Q.when(value).then(function() { throw new Error("intentional error"); }); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that would be resolved with the original value, but would also throw an error when the promise is resolved.

DONE.
