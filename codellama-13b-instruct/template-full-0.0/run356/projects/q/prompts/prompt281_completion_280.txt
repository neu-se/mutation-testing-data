  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `arguments` object as a whole, while the new code fragment is accessing the first element of the `arguments` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `arguments` object as a whole, while the new code fragment is accessing the second element of the `arguments` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `arguments` object as a whole, while the new code fragment is accessing the third element of the `arguments` object.

DONE.
