  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always retain the `other` delta's insert operations, regardless of the priority or the type of the `this` delta's next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always retain the `other` delta's insert operations, regardless of the priority or the type of the `this` delta's next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' && otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to always retain the `other
