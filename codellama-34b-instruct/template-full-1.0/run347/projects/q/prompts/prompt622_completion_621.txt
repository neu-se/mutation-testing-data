  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would pass only the value argument to the dispatch method, whereas the original code passes both key and value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value, undefined]
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would pass an additional undefined argument to the dispatch method, whereas the original code passes only key and value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in a different behavior because it would pass the value and key arguments in the opposite order of the original code.

DONE.
