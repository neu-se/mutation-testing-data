  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length` is a function that returns the length of an operation, whereas `Op.length > 0` is a boolean expression that checks whether the length is greater than zero. If the length is zero, then the expression would evaluate to `false`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length ^ 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length ^ 2` is a boolean expression that checks whether the length is zero, whereas `Op.length` is a function that returns the length of an operation. If the length is zero, then the expression would evaluate to `true`, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length <= 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Op.length <= 1` is a boolean expression that checks whether the length is less
