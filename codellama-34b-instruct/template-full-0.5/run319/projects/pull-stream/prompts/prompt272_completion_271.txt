  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(new PassThrough())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pipe` method would cause the stream to be consumed and transformed, potentially altering its behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(new PassThrough(), { end: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option would prevent the stream from being closed, potentially causing it to never end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stream.pipe(new PassThrough(), { end: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` option would cause the stream to be closed, potentially causing it to end prematurely.

DONE.
