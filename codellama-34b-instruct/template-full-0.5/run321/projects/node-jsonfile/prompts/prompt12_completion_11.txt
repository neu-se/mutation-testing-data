  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is truthy before using its `reviver` property. Replacing it with `undefined` would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` if `options` is not provided, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is truthy before using its `reviver` property. Replacing it with `null` would cause the code to use the `reviver` property of `null`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `options` argument is truthy before using its `reviver` property. Replacing it with an empty object would cause the code to use the `reviver`
