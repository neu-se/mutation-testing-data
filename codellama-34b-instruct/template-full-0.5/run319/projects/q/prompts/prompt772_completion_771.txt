  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.reject()` would reject the promise with no error message, whereas the original code fragment would reject the promise with an error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.resolve()` would resolve the promise with no value, whereas the original code fragment would resolve the promise with the value of the first resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.all()` would wait for all promises to be resolved, whereas the original code fragment would wait for the first promise to be resolved.

DONE.
