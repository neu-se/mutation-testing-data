  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `allRejected` would return a promise that is rejected with an array of rejection reasons, whereas `allResolved` would return a promise that is fulfilled with an array of resolved values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anyResolved
```
This would result in different behavior because `anyResolved` would return a promise that is fulfilled with the first resolved value, whereas `allResolved` would return a promise that is fulfilled with an array of all resolved values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` would return a promise that is fulfilled with an array of promises, whereas `allResolved` would return a promise that is fulfilled with an array of resolved values.

DONE.
