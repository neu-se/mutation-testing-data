  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the value of the `tzs[key]` property to be incremented by 1, which would change the behavior of the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the value of the `tzs[key]` property to be decremented by 1, which would also change the behavior of the `deliverTimezones` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the value of the `tzs[key]` property to be multiplied by 2, which would
