  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(length, index - offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.max` always returns the greater of its two arguments, while the original code fragment only considers the difference between `index - offset` and `length` when `index - offset` is greater than `length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length -= index - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the difference between `index - offset` and `length` from `length`, potentially making it negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index += offset - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the difference between `index - offset` and `length` to `index`, potentially making it negative.

DONE.
