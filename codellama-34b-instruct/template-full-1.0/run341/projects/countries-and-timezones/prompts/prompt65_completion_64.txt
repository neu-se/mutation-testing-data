  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to a different country than the original code, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `memoizeCountry` function to not memoize the country, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `memoizeCountry` function to memoize a different value than the original code, potentially causing the `getCountry` function to return a different country than expected.

DONE.
