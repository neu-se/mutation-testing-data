  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always consider the `delete` property of the `elem` object, instead of the `insert` property as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always consider the `retain` property of the `elem` object, instead of the `insert` property as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always consider the `attributes` property of the `elem` object, instead of the `insert` property as in the original code.

DONE.
