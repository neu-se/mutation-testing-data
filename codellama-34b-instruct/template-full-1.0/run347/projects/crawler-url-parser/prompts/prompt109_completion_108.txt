  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set()` method is being called with a different value. In the original code, the map's keys are the URL strings, but in this variation, the map's keys are the URLs themselves. This means that if there are multiple URLs with the same string representation, they will be considered equal and will overwrite each other in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.protocol + currentUrl.host + currentUrl.path);
```
This would result in different behavior because the map's keys are now the concatenation of the URL's protocol, host, and path, rather than just the URL string. This means that if there are multiple URLs with the same protocol, host, and path, they will be considered equal and will overwrite each other in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.set(currentUrl.url
