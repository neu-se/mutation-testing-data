  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.pop` would remove the last element of the `stacks` array, whereas `stacks.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.shift` would remove the first element of the `stacks` array, whereas `stacks.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stacks.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `stacks.push` would add an element to the end of the `stacks` array, whereas `stacks.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

DONE.
