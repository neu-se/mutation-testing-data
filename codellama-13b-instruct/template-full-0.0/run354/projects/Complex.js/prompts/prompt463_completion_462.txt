  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be inverted, causing the `if` statement to execute when `b` is not close to zero, rather than when it is close to zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be simplified, causing the `if` statement to execute when `b` is exactly zero, rather than when it is close to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < 1e-10
```
This would result in different behavior because the threshold for determining whether `b` is close to zero would be changed, causing the `if` statement to execute when `b` is closer to zero than the original threshold, rather than when it is closer to zero than the original threshold.

DONE.
