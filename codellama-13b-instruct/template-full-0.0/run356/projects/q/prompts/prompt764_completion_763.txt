  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to be called with the `promise` argument, which would cause the `when` function to return a promise that is resolved with the value of the `promise` argument, rather than the value of the `promise` argument itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, function (value) { return value; }, noop)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to be called with the `promise` argument, which would cause the `when` function to return a promise that is resolved with the value of the `promise` argument, rather than the value of the `promise` argument itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(promise, noop, function (error) { throw error; })
```
This would result in different behavior because
