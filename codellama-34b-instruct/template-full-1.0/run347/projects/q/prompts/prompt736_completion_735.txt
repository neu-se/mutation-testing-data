  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` is an array with a single element, whereas the replaced fragment `[this, this]` is an array with two elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[this, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` is an array with a single element, whereas the replaced fragment `[this, void 0]` is an array with two elements, where the second element is `void 0` instead of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[void 0, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `this` is an array with a single element, whereas the replaced fragment `[void 0, this]` is an array with two elements, where the first element is `void 0` instead of `this`. DONE.
