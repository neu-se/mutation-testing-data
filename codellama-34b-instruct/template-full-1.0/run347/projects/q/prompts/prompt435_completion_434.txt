  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always be true, leading to an incorrect check for unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always be false, leading to an incorrect check for unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process.emit !== "function" || array_indexOf(unhandledRejections, promise) === -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to always be false, leading to an incorrect check for unhandled rejections.

DONE.
