  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(other.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could affect the resulting `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(this.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could affect the resulting `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return delta.chop(0);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `chop` method to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could affect the resulting `Delta` object.

DONE.
