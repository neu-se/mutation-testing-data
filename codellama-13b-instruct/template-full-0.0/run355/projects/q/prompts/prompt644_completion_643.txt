  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.promised(function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `add` function, while the new code fragment returns a promise that resolves to the result of the `Q.promised` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object, op, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Q.promised` function to decorate the `add` function, while the new code fragment uses the `Q.dispatch` function to send a message to the `object` with the `op` operation and `args` arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.get(object, key);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Q.promised` function to decorate the `add` function,
