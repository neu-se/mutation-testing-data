  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `args` array, while `args` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.concat()` creates a new array that is the concatenation of the `args` array and any other arrays passed as arguments, while `args` itself is a reference to the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(function(x) { return x * 2; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `args.map()` creates a new array that is the result of applying the provided function to each element of the `args` array, while `args` itself is a reference to the original array.

DONE.
