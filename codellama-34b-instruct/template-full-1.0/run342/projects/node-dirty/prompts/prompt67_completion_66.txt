  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null, () => this._writeStream.destroy());
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `destroy()` method would be called on the `writeStream` immediately after it has been ended, rather than only when the `writeStream` is closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null, () => this._writeStream.destroy(new Error()));
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `destroy()` method would be called on the `writeStream` with a new Error object, rather than the default null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(null, () => this._writeStream.destroy(this._data));
```
This would result in different behavior because now the `destroy()` method would be called on the `writeStream` with the `_data` object, rather than the default null.

DONE.
