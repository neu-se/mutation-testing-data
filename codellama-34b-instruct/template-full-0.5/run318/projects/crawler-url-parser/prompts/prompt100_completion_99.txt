  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the URL is not the same as the URL itself, and it would cause the `Map` to store different values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.replace(/^http(s)?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression would remove the protocol from the URL, causing the `Map` to store different values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would extract the last segment of the URL, causing the `Map` to store different values.

DONE.
