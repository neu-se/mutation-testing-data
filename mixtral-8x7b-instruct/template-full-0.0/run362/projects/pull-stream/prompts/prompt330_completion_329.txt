 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `op` function might receive a `null` value, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` creates a shallow copy of the `data` array, so any modifications to the `data` array after the `slice()` call will not affect the original `data` array. This could cause the `op` function to receive a different array than what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `data` is an array, the `op` function would receive an object instead of an array, which could cause it to throw an error or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
