Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `nodeback` would cause the function to ignore the callback entirely, leading to no callback being invoked when the promise resolves or rejects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would also prevent the callback from being called, similar to passing `null`, but it may lead to different handling in some JavaScript environments where `undefined` is treated differently than `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing `nodeback` with an empty function would cause the promise to resolve or reject without any effect, as the empty function does not handle the result or error, effectively ignoring the outcome of the promise.

DONE.
