  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `keys()` method returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, rather than the values. This means that the `deny()` method would not actually deny any verbs, as the `verb` variable would be set to the keys of the `verbs` object, rather than the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb of verbs.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `entries
