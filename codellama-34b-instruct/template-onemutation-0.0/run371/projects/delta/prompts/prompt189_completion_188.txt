  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes && attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would always assign the `attributes` object to the `newOp.attributes` property, even if it was empty. The modified code fragment would only assign the `attributes` object if it was not empty, which could potentially cause the `newOp.attributes` property to be undefined or null, leading to different behavior in the code that uses the `newOp` object.
