Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it forces the callback to be called with a `true` value, which may not represent an actual error or abort condition, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the stream's state.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, 'error')
```
This would result in different behavior because it sends a string 'error' as the second argument to the callback instead of the expected data, which could cause downstream consumers of the stream to misinterpret the data type and lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `abort` value directly to the callback, which may not be the intended behavior, as it could lead to the callback being invoked with an abort signal instead of a proper error or data response.

DONE.
