  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.slice(0)` would return a new string that is a copy of the original string, whereas `content` would return the original string. If the JSON string contains a BOM character, `content.slice(0)` would remove the BOM, whereas `content` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substring(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.substring(0)` would return a new string that is a copy of the original string, whereas `content` would return the original string. If the JSON string contains a BOM character, `content.substring(0)` would remove the BOM, whereas `content` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('').join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because `content.split('').join('')` would return a new string that is a copy of
