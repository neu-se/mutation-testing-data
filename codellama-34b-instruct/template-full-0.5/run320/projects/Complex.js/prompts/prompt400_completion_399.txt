  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function, which returns the sine of the argument, while the replaced code fragment uses the `sinh()` function, which returns the hyperbolic sine of the argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        -Math.sin(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.sin()` function with a negative argument, while the replaced code fragment uses the `sinh()` function with a positive argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Complex(
        sinh(a) / d,
        Math.cos(b) / d);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment
