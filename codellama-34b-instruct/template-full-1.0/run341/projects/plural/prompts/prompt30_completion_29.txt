  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|crisis/gi
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag would make the regex search for all matches in the input string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/thesis|criteria/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `criteria` pattern would match the word "criteria" in addition to "thesis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/crisis|thesis/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the patterns are swapped, and `crisis` would be matched before `thesis`.

DONE.
