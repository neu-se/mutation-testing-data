  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Different error message");
```
This would result in different behavior because a different error message would be thrown, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return null instead of a promise, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is expecting a promise to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(new Error("Different error message"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a rejected promise with a different error message, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this specific error message.

DONE.
