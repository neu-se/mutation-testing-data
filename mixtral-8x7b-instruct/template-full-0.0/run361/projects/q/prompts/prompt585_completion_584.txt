 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
throw new Error('Buggy code');
```
This would result in different behavior because an unhandled error is thrown instead of executing the original `Q.done`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
return Q.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately resolves the promise with a null value, instead of executing the original `Q.done`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.delay(1000).then(function() { Q.done(); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a 1-second delay before attempting to execute `Q.done`, which might not be defined or available in the current scope.

DONE.
