  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method would be called on the array, resulting in a string representation of the arguments, rather than the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property would be accessed on the array, resulting in the number of elements in the array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method would be called on the array, resulting in a reversed version of the array, rather than the array itself.

DONE.
