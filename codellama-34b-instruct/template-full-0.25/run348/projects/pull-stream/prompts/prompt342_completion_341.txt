  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `abort`, so if `abort` is `true`, `!abort` would be `false`, and the `onAbort` callback would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is a logical OR, so if `abort` is `true`, the expression `abort || onAbort` would evaluate to `true`, and the `onAbort` callback would not be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is a logical AND, so if `abort` is `true`, the expression `abort && onAbort` would evaluate to `onAbort`, and the `onAbort` callback would be called with
