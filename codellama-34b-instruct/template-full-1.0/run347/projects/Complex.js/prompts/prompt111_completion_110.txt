  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{

if (isNaN(z['im']) === true) {
  return Complex['NAN'];
}
return z;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the JavaScript `isNaN` function to check if the `z['im']` property is NaN, but this modification returns `Complex['NAN']` instead of the modified `z` object, potentially causing a mismatch in the object that is returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{

if (isNaN(z['im']) === true) {
  return Complex['INFINITY'];
}
return z;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the JavaScript `isNaN` function to check if the `z['im']` property is NaN, but this modification returns `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of the modified `z` object, potentially causing a mismatch in the object that is returned.
