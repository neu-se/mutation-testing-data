  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `busy`, so the code would execute the `else` block even if `busy` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator checks if both `busy` and `abortCb` are `true`, so the code would execute the `if` block only if both conditions are met.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || abortCb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator checks if either `busy` or `abortCb` is `true`, so the code would execute the `if` block if either condition is met.

DONE.
