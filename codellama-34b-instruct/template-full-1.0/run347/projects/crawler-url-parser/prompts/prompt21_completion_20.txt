  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the base URL of the embedded URL to 'https' instead of 'http'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http//'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the colon after 'http', making the URL invalid.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'httpp'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the base URL of the embedded URL to 'httpp' instead of 'http'.

DONE.
