 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments passed to the callback function are swapped, which may cause issues if the order of arguments is important in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, data, 'extra_argument')
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra, unnecessary argument is passed to the callback function, which may cause tests to fail if they are checking the number of arguments or relying on the specific arguments passed to the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the data is logged to the console instead of being passed to the callback function. This could cause tests to fail if they are checking the behavior of the callback function or if they rely on the side-effect of the data being passed to the callback.

DONE.
