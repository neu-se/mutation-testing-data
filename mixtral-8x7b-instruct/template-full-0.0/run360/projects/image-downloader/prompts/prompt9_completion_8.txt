 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string would always return false for the `!<PLACEHOLDER>(options.dest)` condition, causing the `url` parsing and filename extraction to never occur, even when `options.dest` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` generates a random float number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This could cause the `!<PLACEHOLDER>(options.dest)` condition to evaluate to true or false randomly, even when `options.dest` has the same value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` is a function that checks if the given value is an array. Since it always returns a boolean, the `!<PL
