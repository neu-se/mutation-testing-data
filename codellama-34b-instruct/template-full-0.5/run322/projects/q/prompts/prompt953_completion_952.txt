  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` callback would be called regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function() {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called with a different callback function, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(function(err) { throw err; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method would be called with a different callback function that throws an error, which would not have the same effect as the original code.

DONE.
