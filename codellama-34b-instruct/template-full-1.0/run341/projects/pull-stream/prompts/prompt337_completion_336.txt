  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-prop
```
This would result in different behavior because a different object property is being accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because a different element of the property array is being accessed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(data) { return data.prop + 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function being passed to `filter` has a different implementation.

DONE.
