  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would offset the index by one, potentially causing the program to access the wrong element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would offset the index by one in the opposite direction, potentially causing the program to access the wrong element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the index, potentially causing the program to access the wrong element in the array.

DONE.
