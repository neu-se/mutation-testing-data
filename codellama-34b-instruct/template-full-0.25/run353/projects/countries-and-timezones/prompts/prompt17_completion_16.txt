  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a different value than `id`, and it is used to determine which timezones to include in the `current` and `all` arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.c
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.c` is a different value than `id`, and it is used to determine which countries to include in the `current` and `all` arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.a
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.a` is a different value than `id`, and it is used to determine which timezones to include in the `current` and `all` arrays.

DONE.
