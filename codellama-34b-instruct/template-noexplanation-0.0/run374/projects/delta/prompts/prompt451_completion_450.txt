  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.hasNext()
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more operations to be processed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.index >= this.ops.length
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more operations to be processed, because it checks if the current index is greater than or equal to the length of the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.offset >= Op.length(this.ops[this.index])
```
This change will cause the `rest()` method to always return an empty array, even if there are more operations to be processed, because it checks if the current offset is greater than or equal to the length of the current operation.

DONE.
