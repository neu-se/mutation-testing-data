  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `rejected` is a callback function that is called with the reason for the rejection, whereas `progress` is a callback function that is called with the progress of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `fulfilled` is a callback function that is called with the value of the fulfilled promise, whereas `progress` is a callback function that is called with the progress of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a function that returns `undefined`, whereas `progress` is a callback function that is called with the progress of the promise.

DONE.
