  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if `Q.onerror` is not defined, while this modified code fragment always throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a different error message, while this modified code fragment always throws the same error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error(error.message);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws the error message of the `error` object, while this modified code fragment always throws the error message of the `error` object.

DONE.
