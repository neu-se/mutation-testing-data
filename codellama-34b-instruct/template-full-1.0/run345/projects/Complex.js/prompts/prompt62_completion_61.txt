  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['ARG']
```
This would result in different behavior because `ARG` does not exist in `a`, leading to a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] = null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is now null, causing a different condition to be tested in the following line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg'] = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `a['arg']` is now 0, causing a different condition to be tested in the following line.

DONE.
