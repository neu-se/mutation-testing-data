  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base `Delta` object that starts at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base `Delta` object that is one character shorter than the original slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.slice(baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a slice of the base `Delta` object that is one character longer than the original slice.

DONE.
