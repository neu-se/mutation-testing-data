  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve)`, which is not the same as the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i])`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(answerPs[i]).then(function () { return answerPs[i]; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value returned by `Q(answerPs[i]).then(function () { return answerPs
