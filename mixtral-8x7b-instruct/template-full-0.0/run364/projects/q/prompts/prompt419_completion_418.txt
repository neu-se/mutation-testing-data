 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of invoking an empty object, which is always `undefined`. The original code returns the `state` property of the `inspect()` method's result, which is not `undefined` for a pending promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.inspect().state || 'pending'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 'pending' even if the promise is fulfilled or rejected. The original code returns the `state` property of the `inspect()` method's result, which is either 'fulfilled', 'rejected', or 'pending'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number between 0 and 1 instead of the `state` property of the `inspect()` method's result. This would cause the
