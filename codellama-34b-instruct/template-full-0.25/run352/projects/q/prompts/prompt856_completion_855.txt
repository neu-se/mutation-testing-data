  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects a promise to be returned, but `null` is not a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects a promise to be returned, but `undefined` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` method expects a promise to be returned, but `Promise.reject()` returns a rejected promise, which would cause the `timeout` method to reject immediately.

DONE.
