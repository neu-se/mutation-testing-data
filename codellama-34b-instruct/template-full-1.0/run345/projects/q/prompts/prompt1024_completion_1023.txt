  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function, but null is not a function and will cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + nodeback
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the result of the `nodeback` function to be passed as an argument to `Q.nodeify`, but `1 + nodeback` will perform the addition operator on `nodeback` and pass the result to `Q.nodeify`, which will likely cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects `Q.nodeify` to be called with `nodeback` as the `this` value, but `nodeback.call(this)` will call `Q.nodeify` with `nodeback` as the `this` value, which will likely cause an error.

DONE.
