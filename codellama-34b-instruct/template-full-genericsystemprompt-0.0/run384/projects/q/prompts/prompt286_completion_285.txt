  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, while the `!==` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `resolver` variable is a function, so the `typeof` operator would return the string "function", which would not be strictly equal to the string "function" using the `!==` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== Function
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Function` constructor is a function that creates a new function, but it is not the same as the `typeof` operator, which returns a string indicating the type of the operand. In this case, the `resolver` variable is a function, so the `Function` constructor would return a new function that is not strictly equal to the `resolver` function using the `!==` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
