  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(0)` will return the entire string, while `part.slice(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.slice(2)` will return the substring starting from the third character, while `part.slice(1)` returns the substring starting from the second character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `part.substr(1)` will return the substring starting from the second character, while `part.slice(1)` returns the substring starting from the first character.

DONE.
