  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 === "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for both value and type equality, so `1 === "1"` would be false while `1 == "1"` would be true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the plus operator has higher precedence than the equality operator, so `1 + 1 === 1` would be true while `1 == 1` would be false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1 === "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator converts its operands to numbers, so `1 + 1 === "1"` would be false while `1 == "1"` would be true.

DONE.
