  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: false });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return a different set of timezones, as it would only include non-deprecated timezones.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return a different set of timezones, as it would only include deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverTimezones(timezones, {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deliverTimezones` function would return a different set of timezones, as it would include both deprecated and non-deprecated timezones.

DONE.
