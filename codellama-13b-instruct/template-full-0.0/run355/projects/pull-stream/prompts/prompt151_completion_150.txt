  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, abort, onAbort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` function as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(onAbort, cb, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `onAbort` function as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(cb, onAbort, abort)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abortCb` function is called with the `cb` function as the first argument, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
