  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator())
```
This would result in different behavior because `makeGenerator()` is not a function and would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function (){})
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator function has a different behavior than the original `makeGenerator` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () { throw new Error("test") })
```
This would result in different behavior because the generator function throws an error, causing the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
