 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback is now always null, which might not be the expected behavior in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the first argument of the callback is now always true, which might not be the expected behavior in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { cb(end, data) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the callback in an anonymous function, which might affect the test suite if it relies on the callback being called directly.

DONE.
