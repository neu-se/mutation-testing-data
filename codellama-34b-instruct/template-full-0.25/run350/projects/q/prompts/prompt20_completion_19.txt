  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick = function (task) {
    tail = tail.next = {
        task: task,
        domain: isNodeJS && process.domain,
        next: null
    };

    if (!flushing) {
        flushing = true;
        requestTick();
    }
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `requestTick` function is not defined, so the `nextTick` function would not be able to schedule the task for execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextTick = function (task) {
    tail = tail.next = {
        task: task,
        domain: isNodeJS && process.domain,
        next: null
    };

    if (!flushing) {
        flushing = true;
        setTimeout(flush, 0);
    }
};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function is used to schedule the task for execution, which
