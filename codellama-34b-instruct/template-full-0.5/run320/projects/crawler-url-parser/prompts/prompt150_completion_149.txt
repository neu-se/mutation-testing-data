  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" operator to split the URL path into parts, while the modified code would use the "\" operator, which would result in different parts being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" operator to split the URL path into parts, while the modified code would not split the path at all, resulting in a single part being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the "/" operator to split the URL path into parts, while the modified code would split the path using the " " operator, which would result in different parts being extracted.

DONE.
