  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](word, rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function is called with two arguments, `word` and `rule[0]`, whereas the original code only passes `word` as an argument. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1](rule[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rule[1]` function is called with only one argument, `rule[0]`, whereas the original code passes two arguments, `word` and `rule[0]`. This could cause the function to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.
