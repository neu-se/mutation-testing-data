  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value of `data`, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the value of `data` is not a valid JSON string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the value of `data` to uppercase, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the value of `data` is not a valid JSON string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the value of `data` into an array of individual characters, which would cause the `JSON.parse()` method to fail if the value of `data` is not a valid JSON string.

DONE.
