  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `a[]` is an empty array and does not have the same property names as `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object and does not have the same property names as `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have the same property names as `a`.

DONE.
