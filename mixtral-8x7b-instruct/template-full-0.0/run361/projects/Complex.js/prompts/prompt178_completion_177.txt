 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the denominator, potentially causing a division by zero error or incorrect results when the value is negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root instead of the absolute value, which can lead to incorrect results or errors when the value is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always returns zero, regardless of the input value, which can lead to incorrect results or errors in the downstream calculations.

DONE.
