  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `shift()` method removes the first element of the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on that element being present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on that element being present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the `nodeArgs` array, which could cause the function to fail if it relies on a specific order of the arguments.

DONE.
