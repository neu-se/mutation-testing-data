 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original expression (2 * b) is used to calculate the conjugate of a complex number, while the modified expression (b * b) would result in the square of the imaginary part, which is not the conjugate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would always be 0, regardless of the value of b, while the original expression (2 * b) is used to calculate the conjugate of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression would calculate the square of the imaginary part, while the original expression (2 * b) is used to calculate the conjugate of a complex number.

DONE.
