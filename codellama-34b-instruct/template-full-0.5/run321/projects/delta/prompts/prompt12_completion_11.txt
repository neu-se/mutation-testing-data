  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for `undefined`, while this new code fragment checks for `null`. This could cause the `transform` function to behave differently when handling `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `undefined` and `null`, while this new code fragment only checks for `undefined`. This could cause the `transform` function to behave differently when handling `null` values.
