  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which could cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array is being reversed before being passed to the function, which could cause issues if the function being called expects the arguments in a specific order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.concat(["extra argument"])]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is being added to the `args` array before being passed to the function, which could cause issues if the function being called does not expect additional arguments.

DONE.
