  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over some of the operations in the delta, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over some of the operations in the other delta, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(length - index);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip over some of the operations in the delta, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
