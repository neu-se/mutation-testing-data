  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the previous token instead of the next token, which could cause the parser to interpret the string in a different way.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the token after the next token instead of the next token, which could cause the parser to interpret the string in a different way.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the token at the current index multiplied by 2, which could cause the parser to interpret the string in a different way.

DONE.
