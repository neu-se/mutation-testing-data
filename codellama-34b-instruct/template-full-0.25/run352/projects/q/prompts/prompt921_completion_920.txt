  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the function call was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be resolved even if the function call was unsuccessful.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the promise returned by `fapply`, which would cause the promise to be rejected even if the function call was successful.

DONE.
