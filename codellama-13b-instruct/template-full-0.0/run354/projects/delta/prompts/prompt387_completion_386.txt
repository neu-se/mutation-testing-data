  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are required to call the `peekLength` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` property is being accessed instead of the `peekLength()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method is being called and the result is being added to 1.

DONE.
