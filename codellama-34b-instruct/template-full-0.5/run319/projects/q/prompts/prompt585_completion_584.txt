  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.done(Q.async(makeGenerator)());
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` is not a valid method in Q, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().done();
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is not a valid method in the return value of `Q.async`, and it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)().then(Q.done);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` is not a valid method in Q, and it would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
