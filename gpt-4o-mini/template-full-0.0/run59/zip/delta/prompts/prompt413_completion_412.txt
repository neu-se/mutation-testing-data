Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an extra length to the value returned by `peekLength`, potentially causing the index to be incremented incorrectly when processing operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts one from the length, which could lead to incorrect index calculations, especially when handling insertions or deletions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length, which would cause the index to move further than intended, potentially skipping over operations or misaligning the transformation logic.

DONE.
