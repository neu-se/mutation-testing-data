  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `abort` signal would be ignored, and the callback would be called with the next chunk of data instead of the current stream being aborted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would not be called with the `abort` signal, and the current stream would not be aborted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because both the `abort` signal and the callback would be ignored, and the current stream would not be aborted.

DONE.
