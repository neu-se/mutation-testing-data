  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'a' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would append the letter 'i' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment would append the letter 'a'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'e' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would append the letter 'i' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment would append the letter 'e'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'o' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would append the letter 'i' to the end of the word, while this new code fragment would append the letter 'o
