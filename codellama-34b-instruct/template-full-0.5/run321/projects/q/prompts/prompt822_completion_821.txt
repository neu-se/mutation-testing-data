  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise as an argument, while passing null would result in a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise as an argument, while passing undefined would result in a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject("error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a promise that resolves to a value, while passing a rejected promise would result in the promise being rejected with the given reason.

DONE.
