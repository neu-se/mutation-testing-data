  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking = function () {
    trackUnhandledRejections = false;
    unhandledReasons.length = 0;
    unhandledRejections.length = 0;
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.stopUnhandledRejectionTracking = function () {
    trackUnhandledRejections = false;
    unhandledReasons = [];
    unhandledRejections = [];
};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `unhandledReasons` and `unhandledRejections` arrays to empty arrays, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not work correctly.
