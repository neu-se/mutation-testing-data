  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This code fragment is a function call, which is different from the original code fragment that was a property access. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the implementation of the `isInfinite` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = true
```
This code fragment is an assignment, which is different from the original code fragment that was a property access. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the implementation of the `isInfinite` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] = function() { return true; }
```
This code fragment is a function definition, which is different from the original code fragment that was a property access. This change could potentially cause the code to behave differently, depending on the implementation of the `isInfinite` function.

DONE.
