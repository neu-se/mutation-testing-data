Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed without throwing an error if both properties exist, even if they are not valid numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!object.latitude && !object.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if both latitude and longitude are falsy values (e.g., 0, null, undefined), which would not correctly validate the presence of the properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('lat') || object.hasOwnProperty('long')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly validate the object based on the presence of 'lat' and 'long' properties instead of 'latitude' and 'longitude', potentially allowing invalid objects to pass through.

DONE.
