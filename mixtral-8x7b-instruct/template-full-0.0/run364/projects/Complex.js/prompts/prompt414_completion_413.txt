 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a - Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the expression, which significantly alters the result of the `acsch` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.sqrt(a * a + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it flips the expression and introduces a division operation, which would lead to incorrect results in the `acsch` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
a * Math.sqrt(a * a - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the expression inside the square root, which would cause issues when the input `a` is less than 1, leading to incorrect results in the `acsch` function.

DONE.
