  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_a
```
This would result in different behavior because `_a` is the absolute value of `a`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_b * _b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would square the absolute value of `b`, while `_b` is already the squared absolute value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(_a * _a + _b * _b)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compute the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`, while `_b` is the absolute value of `b`.

DONE.
