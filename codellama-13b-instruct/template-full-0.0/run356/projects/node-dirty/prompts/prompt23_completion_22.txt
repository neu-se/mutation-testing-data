  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); this.emit('drain'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the 'drain' event after the callback is executed, while the buggy code fragment emits the 'drain' event before the callback is executed. This could cause issues if the callback relies on the 'drain' event being emitted before it is executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => { if (cb) cb(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits the 'drain' event after the callback is executed, while the buggy code fragment does not emit the 'drain' event. This could cause issues if the callback relies on the 'drain' event being emitted before it is executed.
