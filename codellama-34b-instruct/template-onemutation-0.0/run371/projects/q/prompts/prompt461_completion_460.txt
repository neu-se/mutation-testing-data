  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" || typeof process.emit !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object and has an `emit` method, while the new code fragment checks if `process` is not an object or does not have an `emit` method. If `process` is not an object or does not have an `emit` method, the new code fragment will not emit an "unhandledRejection" event, while the original code fragment would.
