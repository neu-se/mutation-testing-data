 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the placeholder argument with a string, which would cause the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to always return an array containing the country with the timezone name "UTC".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
