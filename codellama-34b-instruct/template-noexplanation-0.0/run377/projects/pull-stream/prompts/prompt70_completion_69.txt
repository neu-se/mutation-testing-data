  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it has the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || !abort
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it has different behavior. The `!abort` expression is negated, which means that the `abort` function will be called if the `op` function returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && false === op(data) || abort()
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it has different behavior. The `abort()` function is called if the `op` function returns `false`.

DONE.
