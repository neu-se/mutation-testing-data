  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'src'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` attribute is used for the URL of an image or other media, whereas the `href` attribute is used for the URL of a link.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'text'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `text` attribute is used to specify the text content of an element, whereas the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'url'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `url` attribute is used to specify the URL of an element, whereas the `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of a link.

DONE.
