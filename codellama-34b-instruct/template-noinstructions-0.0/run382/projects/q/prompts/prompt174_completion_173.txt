  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.replace("line", "line\n");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra newline character to the end of the line, which could affect the formatting of the output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.replace("line", "line\t");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the word "line" with the word "line" followed by a tab character, which could affect the formatting of the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.replace("line", "");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the word "line" from the output, which could affect the meaning of the output.

DONE.
