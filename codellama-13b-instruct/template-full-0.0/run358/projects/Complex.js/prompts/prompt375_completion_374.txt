  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the cosine of `2 * a` using the `cosh` function, while the modified code fragment calculates the cosine of `2 * a` using the `Math.cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of `2 * a` using the `cosh` function, while the modified code fragment calculates the sine of `2 * a` using the `Math.sin` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(2 * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the tangent of `2 * a` using the `cosh` function, while the modified code fragment calculates the tangent of `2 * a` using the
