  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "die" specifically, while the new code fragment would check for any word ending in "dice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dies'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "die" specifically, while the new code fragment would check for any word ending in "dies".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'die'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking for the word "die" specifically, while the new code fragment would check for any word ending in "die".

DONE.
