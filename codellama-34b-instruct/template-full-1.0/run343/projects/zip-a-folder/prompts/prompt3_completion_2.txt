  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: zipFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions}
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being called would be `zip` instead of `tar`, and the file format would be `zip` instead of `tar`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: tarFilePath, format: 'tar', zipAFolderOptions: {compression: COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be `uncompressed` instead of the default level `high`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{src, targetFilePath: zipFilePath, format: 'zip', zipAFolderOptions: {customWriteStream: <writeStream>}}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `customWriteStream` property would be set to a different value instead of the default value.

DONE.
