Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would not escape the '$' character, potentially leading to incorrect path resolution if the target path contains '$' characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentPath
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would use the source path instead of the target path, potentially leading to incorrect file copying or overwriting of the original files.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath.replace('$', '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the replacement would remove all '$' characters from the target path instead of escaping them, potentially leading to incorrect path resolution or security vulnerabilities if the target path contains '$' characters that are intended to be escaped.

DONE.
