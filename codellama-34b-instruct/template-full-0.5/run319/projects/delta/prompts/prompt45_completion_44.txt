  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `typeof b !== 'object'` and `b === null`, which means that the code would only enter the `if` block if `b` is not an object and is not null. By replacing the PLACEHOLDER with `typeof b !== 'object'`, the code would enter the `if` block if `b` is not an object, regardless of whether it is null or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for both `typeof b !== 'object'` and `b === null`, which means that the code would only enter the `if` block if `b` is not an object and is null.
