  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `includes` method to check if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text` string, while the buggy code fragment uses the `includes` method to check if the `text` variable is included in the `tmpUrl.text.includes` string, which is not a valid method.
