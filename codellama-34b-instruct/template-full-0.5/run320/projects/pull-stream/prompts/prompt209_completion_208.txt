  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `aborted` is truthy, while the new code checks if it is falsy. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `aborted` is equal to a specific value, while the new code adds 1 to that value. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `aborted` is a boolean value, while the new code converts it to a string. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases.

DONE.
