  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.peek` returns the next element in the iterator without advancing it, whereas `iter.next` returns the next element and advances the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.previous
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.previous` returns the previous element in the iterator without rewinding it, whereas `iter.next` returns the next element and advances the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.rewind
```
This would result in different behavior because `iter.rewind` rewinds the iterator to the beginning, whereas `iter.next` advances the iterator to the next element.

DONE.
