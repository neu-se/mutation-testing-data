 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `untrackRejection` function checks if the promise passed to it is the same as the one in the `unhandledRejections` array. Replacing `this` with `null` would mean that the promise being untracked is not the same as the one in the array, and thus, the unhandled rejection would not be properly removed from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
