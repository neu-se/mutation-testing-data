  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This change will cause the code to reject the promise with a `TimeoutError` if the status code is not 300, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 300
```
This change will cause the code to reject the promise with a `TimeoutError` if the status code is not 200 or 300, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 200 && res.statusCode !== 300 && res.statusCode !== 400
```
This change will cause the code to reject the promise with a `TimeoutError` if the status code is not 200, 300, or 400, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
