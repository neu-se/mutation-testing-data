  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.rest` is a reference to the remaining ops in the iterator, and calling `slice()` on it would create a new array containing the same ops, which would cause the `concat` method to behave differently.
