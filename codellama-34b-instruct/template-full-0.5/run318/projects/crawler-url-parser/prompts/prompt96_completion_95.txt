  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `,` operator to concatenate `href` and `baseUrlStr`, while this replacement uses the `+` operator. This could result in a different string being generated, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href + baseUrlStr + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the string `'foo'`, while this replacement does. This could result in a different string being generated, which could in turn affect the behavior of the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + href
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `,` operator to concatenate `href` and `baseUrlStr` in a different order, while this replacement uses the `+` operator in a different order. This could result
