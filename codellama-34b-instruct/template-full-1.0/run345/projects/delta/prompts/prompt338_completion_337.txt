  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be calculated incorrectly, which would cause the incorrect index to be used in the `slice` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be calculated incorrectly, which would cause the incorrect index to be used in the `slice` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset would be calculated incorrectly, which would cause the incorrect index to be used in the `slice` method.

DONE.
