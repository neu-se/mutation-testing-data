  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the added string 'foo' would cause the resulting JSON string to be different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options).toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting JSON string would be in uppercase, which could cause issues if the JSON is being used in a case-sensitive context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options).replace('foo', 'bar')
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting JSON string would have all occurrences of 'foo' replaced with 'bar', which could cause issues if the JSON is being used in a context where these values are expected to be present.

DONE.
