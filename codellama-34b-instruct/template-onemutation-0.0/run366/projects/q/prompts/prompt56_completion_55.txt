  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.nextTick.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `process.nextTick` is a function that expects to be called with `process` as its context, but `process.nextTick.bind(null)` returns a new function that has `null` as its context, which would cause the code to fail.

DONE.
