  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all([value])
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all()` returns a promise that resolves with an array of values, whereas `Q` returns a promise for the value itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` returns a promise that is already resolved with the given value, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending until the value is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` returns a promise that is already rejected with the given value, whereas `Q` returns a promise that is pending until the value is resolved.

DONE.
