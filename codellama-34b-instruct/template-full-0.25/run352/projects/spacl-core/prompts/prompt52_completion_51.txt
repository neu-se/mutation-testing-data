  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+)/g, '\\$1'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/([^/]+)/g` matches any character that is not a forward slash, and the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of this pattern with the replacement string `\\$1`, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+)/g, '\\$1').toLowerCase())

This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method would convert the replacement string to lowercase, which would result in a different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.push(part.replace(/([^/]+)/g, '\\$1').toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would convert
