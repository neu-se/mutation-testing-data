  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFile` is a different function that has a different implementation than `_readFile`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_readFileSync` is a different function that has a different implementation than `_readFile`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_writeFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `_writeFileSync` is a different function that has a different implementation than `_readFile`.

DONE.
