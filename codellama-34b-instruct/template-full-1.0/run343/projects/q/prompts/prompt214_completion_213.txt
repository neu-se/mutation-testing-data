  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a promise-like object, but `isPromise` only checks if the value is a promise object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseLike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromise` only checks if the value is a promise object, but `isPromiseLike` checks if the value is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof value === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the value is a function, but `isPromise` and `isPromiseLike` check if the value is a promise object or a promise-like object, respectively.

DONE.
