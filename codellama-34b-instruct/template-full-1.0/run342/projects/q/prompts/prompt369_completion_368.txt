  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject("newException")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with the string "newException", even if the original promise was resolved or rejected with a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Error("newException"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a new Error object with the message "newException", even if the original promise was resolved or rejected with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(new Promise.reject(exception))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always reject with a new Promise that is already in the rejected state, even if the original promise was resolved or rejected with a different value.

DONE.
