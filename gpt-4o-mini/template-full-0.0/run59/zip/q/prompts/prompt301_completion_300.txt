Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[x, y]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the variables being compared from `this` and `that` to `x` and `y`, which may not refer to the same promise objects, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when checking for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[that, this]
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the order of the variables being compared, which could lead to a situation where the equality check fails even if the original promises were equal, thus throwing an error incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the promise references with `null`, causing the equality check to always fail and throw an error, regardless of the actual values of `this` and `that`.

DONE.
