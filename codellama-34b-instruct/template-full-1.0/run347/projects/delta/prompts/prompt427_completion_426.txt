  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because when `op.retain` is 0, the original code would return 1, but the modified code would return 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because when `op.retain` is a string, the original code would return 1, but the modified code would return 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because when `op.retain` is null, the original code would return 1, but the modified code would return 0.

DONE.
