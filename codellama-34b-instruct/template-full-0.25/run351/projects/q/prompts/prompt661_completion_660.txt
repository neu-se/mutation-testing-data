  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method is not defined in the `Promise.prototype` and would cause a `TypeError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method is defined in the `Promise.prototype` and would return a promise for the value of the property, which is not the intended behavior in this context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is defined in the `Promise.prototype` and would return a promise for the result of the operation, which is not the intended behavior in this context.

DONE.
