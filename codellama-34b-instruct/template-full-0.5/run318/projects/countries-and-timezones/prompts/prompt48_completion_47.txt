  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the condition to always be true, even if the number of timezones and the number of memoized timezones are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== memoizedTimezones - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the condition to always be false, even if the number of timezones and the number of memoized timezones are different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
totalTimezones !== Object.keys(timezones).length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the length of the `timezones` object, rather than the number of memoized timezones.

DONE.
