  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `parseQueryString` parameter would cause the query string to not be parsed, which could result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, false, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `false` value for the `parsePath` parameter would cause the path to not be parsed, which could result in incorrect URLs being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `true` value for both `parseQueryString` and `parsePath` parameters would cause the query string and path to be parsed, which could result in incorrect URLs being generated if the input URL is not well-formed.

DONE.
