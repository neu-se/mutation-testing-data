  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the error from being handled by the `Q.onerror` handler, which may be important for debugging or error handling purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function () {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` handler with a no-op function, which would prevent the error from being handled and may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror = function (error) { throw error; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `Q.onerror` handler with a function that throws the error, which would cause the promise to be rejected and propagate the error to the next promise in the chain.

DONE.
