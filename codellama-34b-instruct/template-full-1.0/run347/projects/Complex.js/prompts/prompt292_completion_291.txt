  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1e-15
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of a small
epsilon value changes the result of the calculation. This mutation could
remain undetected by test cases that do not account for small numerical
perturbations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the input value
is flipped. This mutation could lead to different numerical results, but
would likely be detected by test cases that check for the correct sign of
the output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * (1 + 1e-15)
```
This would result in a slightly different behavior than the original code,
but the difference is small and may not be detected by test cases that do
not account for small numerical perturbations. This mutation could
remain undetected by test cases that do not check for exact equality.
