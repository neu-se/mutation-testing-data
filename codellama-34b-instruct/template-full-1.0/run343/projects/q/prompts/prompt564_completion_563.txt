  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because the generated function would no longer return a promise if an exception is thrown, but instead would invoke the errback function with the exception as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(error, callback, errback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the generated function would treat the error argument as a promise and invoke the errback function only when the error promise is rejected, instead of immediately invoking the errback function with the error as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the generated function would return the value of the error as a promise, instead of returning a rejected promise with the error as an argument.

DONE.
