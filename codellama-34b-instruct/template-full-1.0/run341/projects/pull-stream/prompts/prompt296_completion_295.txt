  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended && !end
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator has been placed before `ended`, which would cause the condition to be inverted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && end
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition has been simplified by removing the negation operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(ended || end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition has been changed to include both `ended` and `end`, which would cause the behavior of the function to diverge depending on the values of these variables.

DONE.
