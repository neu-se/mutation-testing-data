  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last operation in the `other` delta, which could potentially affect the resulting delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last two operations in the `other` delta, which could potentially affect the resulting delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.ops.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the last three operations in the `other` delta, which could potentially affect the resulting delta.

DONE.
