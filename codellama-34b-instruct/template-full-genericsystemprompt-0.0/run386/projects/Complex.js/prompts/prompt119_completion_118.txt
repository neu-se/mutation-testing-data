  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / abs;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a division by zero error when `abs` is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * abs;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the result to be always positive, regardless of the sign of `this['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] - abs;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the result to be always negative, regardless of the sign of `this['re']`.

DONE.
