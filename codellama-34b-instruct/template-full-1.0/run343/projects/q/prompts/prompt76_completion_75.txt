  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code posted a message with the value 0, and this code would post a message with the value 1, which could have different effects on the program's execution.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage("hello");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code posted a message with a numerical value, and this code would post a message with a string value, which could also have different effects on the program's execution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port2.postMessage(function() {
  return "Hello";
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code posted a message with a numerical value, and this code would post a message with a function value, which could also have different effects on the program's execution.

DONE.
