  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.reject(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject()`, which would reject the promise with the error object passed to it. However, `deferred.reject(deferred.reject)` would reject the promise with the `deferred.reject` function itself, which is not an error object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `deferred.reject()`, which would reject the promise with the error object passed to it. However, `deferred.resolve(deferred.reject)` would resolve the promise with the `deferred.reject` function itself, which is not an error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return deferred.resolve(deferred.reject(deferred.reject));
```
