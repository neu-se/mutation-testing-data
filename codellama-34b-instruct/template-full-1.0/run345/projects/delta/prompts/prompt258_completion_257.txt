  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `thisOp.insert` is a string, which would fail if `thisOp.insert` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['hello', 'hello']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code treats `thisOp.insert` as a string, which would not be the case if it is replaced with an array of strings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ foo: 'bar' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code treats `thisOp.insert` as a string, which would not be the case if it is replaced with an object.

DONE.
