  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.rest())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `next` element with the result of the `rest()` method, which would return a new array with the remaining elements of the `ops` array. In the original code, the `rest()` method is only called if the `offset` is greater than 0, and it returns a new array with the remaining elements of the `ops` array starting from the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].concat(this.ops.slice(this.index + 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `next` element with the result of slicing the `ops` array from the current index plus 1 to the end of the array. In the original code, the `rest()` method is only called if the `offset` is greater than 0, and it returns a new array with the remaining elements of the `ops` array starting from the current index.
