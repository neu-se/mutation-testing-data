  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because cbed is always true, so the loop would never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbed
```
This would result in different behavior because !cbed is always false, so the loop would never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbed || abort
```
This would result in different behavior because cbed is true if the callback has been called, and abort is true if the stream has been aborted. If either of these conditions is true, the loop would terminate.

DONE.
