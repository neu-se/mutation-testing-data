  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment calls it with both `null` and the result of `generate()`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(end, generate())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the `end` argument, while this new code fragment calls it with the `end` argument and the result of `generate()`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, generate() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with the result of `generate()`, while this new code fragment calls it with the result of `generate() + 1`.

DONE.
