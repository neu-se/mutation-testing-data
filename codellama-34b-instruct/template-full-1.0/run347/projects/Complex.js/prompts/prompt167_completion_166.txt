  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && !z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a bug that would cause the code to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when it should be returning `Complex['ZERO']`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a bug that would cause the code to return `Complex['ZERO']` when it should be returning `Complex['INFINITY']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a bug that would cause the code to return a complex number with a negative real part when it should be returning a complex number with a positive real part.

DONE.
