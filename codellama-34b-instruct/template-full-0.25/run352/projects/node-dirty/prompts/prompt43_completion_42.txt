  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `val` would be incremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `val` would be decremented by 1, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value in the database.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `val` would be multiplied by 2, which would cause the `set` method to store a different value in the database.

DONE.
