  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the `set` method to assign the value of the `key` argument to the `value` property of the object, rather than the other way around.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `value` argument is incremented by 1 before being assigned to the `key` property of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `value` argument is multiplied by 2 before being assigned to the `key` property of the object.

DONE.
