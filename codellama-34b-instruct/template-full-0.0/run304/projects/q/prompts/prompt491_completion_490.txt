  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(this);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with `this` as an argument, which is not the same as the original code that called `untrackRejection` with `promise` as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(promise);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with `promise` as an argument, which is not the same as the original code that called `untrackRejection` with `this` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
untrackRejection(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `untrackRejection` function with `null` as an argument, which is not the same as the original code that called `untrackRejection` with `promise` as an argument.
