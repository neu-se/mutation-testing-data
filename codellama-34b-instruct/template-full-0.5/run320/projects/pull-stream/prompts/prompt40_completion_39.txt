  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would be applied to `read`, which is a function, instead of the `read` function being called with a `1` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would be applied to `read`, which is a function, instead of the `read` function being called with a `-1` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would be applied to `read`, which is a function, instead of the `read` function being called with a `2` argument.

DONE.
