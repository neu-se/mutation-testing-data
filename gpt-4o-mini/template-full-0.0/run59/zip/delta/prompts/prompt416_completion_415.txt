Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat all operations as inserts, potentially causing the index to be incorrectly adjusted when encountering delete operations, leading to incorrect position transformations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assume the next operation is always a retain, which could skip over delete operations and incorrectly calculate the index, resulting in an inaccurate transformation of positions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly process the next operation as a delete, which would lead to an incorrect adjustment of the index when it should be considering other operation types, potentially causing data loss in the transformation logic.

DONE.
