 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would now consider `null` to be an object, which could cause issues in code that relies on this function to correctly identify object types.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would now consider the number `1` to be an object, which could cause issues in code that relies on this function to correctly identify object types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isObject` function would now consider an empty array to be an object, which could cause issues in code that relies on this function to correctly identify object types.

DONE.
