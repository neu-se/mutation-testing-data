  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function returns the square root of a number, while the original code fragment returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.pow` function returns the result of raising a number to a power, while the original code fragment returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.hypot
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.hypot` function returns the square root of the sum of the squares of its arguments, while the original code fragment returns the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

DONE.
