  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude <= -180 || longitude >= 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for strict inequality, while this code checks for non-strict inequality, which would allow values of longitude that are equal to -180 or 180 to pass the check.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
longitude < -180 || longitude > 180 || longitude == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code only checks for values of longitude that are less than -180 or greater than 180, while this code also checks for values of longitude that are equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(longitude) > 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for values of longitude that are less than -180 or greater than 180, while this code checks for values of longitude
