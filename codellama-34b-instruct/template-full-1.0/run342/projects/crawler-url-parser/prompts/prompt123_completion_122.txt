  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.keys()` returns an iterator over the keys in the map, while `urlMap.values()` returns an iterator over the values in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because `urlMap.entries()` returns an iterator over the entries in the map, which are key-value pairs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[...urlMap]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array containing all the entries in the map, rather than iterating over the values in the map.

DONE.
