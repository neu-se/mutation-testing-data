  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would slice the `arguments` object starting from the third argument, instead of starting from the second argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all the elements of `arguments` starting from the index `1`, instead of starting from the index `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[].concat(arguments).slice(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new array by concatenating the `arguments` object with an empty array, and then slicing the resulting array starting from the index `2`, instead of starting from the index `1`.

DONE.
