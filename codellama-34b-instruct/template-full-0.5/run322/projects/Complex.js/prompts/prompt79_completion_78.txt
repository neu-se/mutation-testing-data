  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== ' ' && c !== '\t' && c !== '\n'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a whitespace character, while the new code fragment checks if `c` is not a whitespace character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a whitespace character, while the new code fragment also checks if `c` is the plus sign.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === '+' || c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `c` is a whitespace character, while the new code fragment also checks if `c` is either the plus sign or the minus sign.
