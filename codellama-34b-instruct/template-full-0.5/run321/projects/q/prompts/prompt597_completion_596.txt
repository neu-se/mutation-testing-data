  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch.bind(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` value and argument list, whereas the original code uses the `this` value of `Q(object)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(object)
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects a function as its first argument, whereas the original code passes the `object` as the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch(object, function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` expects a function as its second argument, whereas the original code does not pass any function as the second argument.

DONE.
