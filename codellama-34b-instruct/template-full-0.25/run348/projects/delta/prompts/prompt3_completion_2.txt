  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.assign({}, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.assign` creates a shallow copy of the object, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of the array, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b.map(x => x)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` creates a new array with the same elements, whereas `cloneDeep` creates a deep copy of the array.

DONE.
