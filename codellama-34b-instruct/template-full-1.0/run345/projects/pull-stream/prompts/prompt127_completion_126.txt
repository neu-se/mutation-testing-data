  Sure, here are three possible options for the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(i > max) return cb(null, i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only return `null` if `i` is greater than `max`, while the mutated code would always return `null` regardless of the value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(i > max) return cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would only return `null` if `i` is greater than `max`, while the mutated code would always return `null` regardless of the value of `i`. Additionally, the mutated code would also return `null` as the second argument to the callback function, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(i > max) return cb(i, null)
```
This would
