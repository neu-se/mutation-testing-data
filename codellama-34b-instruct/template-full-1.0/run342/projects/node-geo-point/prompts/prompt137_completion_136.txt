  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the longitude value before rounding it to the specified precision, which could cause the adjusted longitude to be different from the original longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.latitude * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the latitude value before rounding it to the specified precision, which could cause the adjusted latitude to be different from the original latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the longitude value before rounding it to the specified precision, which could cause the adjusted longitude to be different from the original longitude.

DONE.
