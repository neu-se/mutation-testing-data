  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.createWriteStream(targetFilePath, { flags: 'w' })
```
This code creates a write stream to the target file path, but with the `flags` option set to `'w'`, which means that the file will be overwritten if it already exists. This is different from the original code, which used the `flags` option set to `'a'`, which means that the file will be appended to if it already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
