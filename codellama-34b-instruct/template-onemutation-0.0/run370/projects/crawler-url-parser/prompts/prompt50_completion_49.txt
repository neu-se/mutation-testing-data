  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl)
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` is a function that resolves a relative URL to a base URL, whereas `URL.parse` is a function that parses a URL string into its components. Using `URL.resolve` instead of `URL.parse` would cause the code to produce a different output.
