  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this new code checks if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof handler === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this new code checks if it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.constructor !== Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `handler` is falsy, while this new code checks if it is not an object.

DONE.
