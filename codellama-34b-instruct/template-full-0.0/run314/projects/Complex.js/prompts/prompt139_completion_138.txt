  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` object, so it would throw a `TypeError` when called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the `Complex` object, so it would always return `true` when called with `isInfinite`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](z)
```
This would result in different behavior because `z` refers to the `Complex` object, so it would always return `true` when called with `isInfinite`.

DONE.
