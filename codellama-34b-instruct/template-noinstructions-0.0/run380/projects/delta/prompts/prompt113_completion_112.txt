  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.length, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the total length of the ops array, rather than the sum of the lengths of the individual ops.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.retain, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the retain property of each op, rather than the length of the op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr.insert, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the insert property of each op, rather than the length of the op.

DONE.
