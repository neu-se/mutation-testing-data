Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next().retain);
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly retains the next operation from `otherIter` instead of pushing the operation to `delta`, which would change the intended operation from inserting to retaining.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the next operation from `thisIter` instead of `otherIter`, which would lead to the wrong operation being added to `delta`, potentially altering the final result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete(otherIter.next().delete);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to delete the next operation from `otherIter`, which is not the intended action and would result in a loss of data instead of adding it to `delta`.

DONE.
