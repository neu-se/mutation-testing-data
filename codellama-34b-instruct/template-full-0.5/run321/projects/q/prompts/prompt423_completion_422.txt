  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the state property of the inspect method, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the fulfilled property of the inspect method, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the rejected property of the inspect method, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

DONE.
