  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(null, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `null` instead of `continuer`, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(undefined, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `undefined` instead of `continuer`, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "next")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method would be called on `continuer` instead of `null`, which would cause the function to be bound to the `continuer` object instead of `null`.

DONE.
