 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve.apply(deferred, [null].concat(nodeArgs))
```
This would result in different behavior because the NodeJS continuation passing function would receive a resolved promise instead of a Node-style callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(new Error('Unexpected error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with an unexpected error, instead of handling the Node-style callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
nodeArgs.push(function () { throw new Error('Callback called synchronously') })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when the Node-style callback is called synchronously, which should not happen in the original code.

DONE.
