Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data[field]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access a property of the `data` object using the `field` variable as a key, which may not correspond to the intended unique identifier, potentially leading to incorrect filtering of unique items.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field(data) + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the key by appending a string '1' to the result of the `field(data)` function, which would cause all keys to be unique by design, thus failing to filter out duplicates correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the key to `null` for every item, causing all items to be treated as the same and effectively ignoring the uniqueness check, leading to all items being considered duplicates.

DONE.
