 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return Infinity, regardless of the input's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.isZero
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the `isZero` property of the current object, instead of invoking the `isZero` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return false; }
