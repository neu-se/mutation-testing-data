  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.coth
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.coth` returns the hyperbolic cotangent of a number, while `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine.

DONE.
