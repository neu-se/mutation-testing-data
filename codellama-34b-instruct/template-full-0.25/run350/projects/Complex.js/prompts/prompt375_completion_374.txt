  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related functions, but they are not identical. In particular, `sinh(x)` is equal to `cosh(x)` only when `x` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh(x)` is equal to `cosh(x)` only when `x` is equal to 0, but it is not equal to `sinh(x)` in general.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acosh
```
This would result in different behavior because `acosh(x)` is equal to `cosh(x)` only when `x` is equal to 1, but it is not equal to `sinh(x)` in general.

DONE.
