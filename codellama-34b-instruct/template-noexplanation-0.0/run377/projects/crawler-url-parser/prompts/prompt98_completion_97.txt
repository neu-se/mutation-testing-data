  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) && urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This code fragment checks if the current URL is already in the map, and if it is, it checks if the text of the current URL is already included in the map. If both conditions are true, it means that the current URL has already been processed and there is no need to add it to the map again.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.has(currentUrl.url) || urlMap.get(currentUrl.url).text.includes(text)
```
This code fragment checks if the current URL is already in the map, and if it is not, it checks if the text of the current URL is already included in the map. If either condition is true, it means that the current URL has already been processed and there is no need to add it to the map again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!url
