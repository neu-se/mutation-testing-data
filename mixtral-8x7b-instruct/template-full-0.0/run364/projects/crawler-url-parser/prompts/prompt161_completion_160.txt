 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the comparison from "loose" equality (`==`) to "strict" equality (`===`). This could cause the function to return a different result if the `linkurl_without_last_part` or `pageurl_without_last_part` variables contain values that are not of the same type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
linkurl_without_last_part.localeCompare(pageurl_without_last_part) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `localeCompare()` method to compare the two strings, which returns a value indicating their relative order. If the two strings are equivalent, it returns `0`. This could cause the function to return a different result if the `linkurl_without_last_part` or `pageurl_without_last_part` variables contain strings that are considered equal by
