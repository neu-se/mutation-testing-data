  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the stringified object, rather than the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the parsed object, rather than the stringified object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options) + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a concatenation of the stringified object and the string "foo", rather than just the stringified object.

DONE.
