  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.url
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.url` is a string, while `currentUrl` is an object with properties such as `url`, `text`, and `type`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that does not have properties such as `url`, `text`, and `type`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have properties such as `url`, `text`, and `type`.

DONE.
