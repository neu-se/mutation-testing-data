 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use 0 as the indentation level instead of the `spaces` value passed in the options object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the default JSON.stringify indentation level (null) instead of the `spaces` value passed in the options object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
replacer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `replacer` function as the indentation level instead of the `spaces` value passed in the options object.

DONE.
