  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method of a string returns the characters between two indexes, whereas the `substr` method returns the substring beginning at the specified index and continuing for the specified number of characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of a string returns the length of the string, whereas the `substr` method returns the substring beginning at the specified index and continuing for the specified number of characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.indexOf(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method of a string returns the position of the first occurrence of the specified value, whereas the `substr` method returns the substring beginning at the specified index and continuing for the specified number of characters.

DONE.
