  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `!array` to check if `array` is falsy, while the mutated code is checking if `array` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `array` is not falsy, while the mutated code always returns `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `i` is greater than or equal to 0, while the mutated code is checking if `i` is equal to 0.

DONE.
