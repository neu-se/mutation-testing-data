  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(aborted)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` only calls the `abortCb` function if `busy` is `false`, but the new code fragment calls it unconditionally, which could cause the callback to be called twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` only calls the `abortCb` function with the `aborted` error, but the new code fragment calls it with the `err` error, which could cause the callback to be called with a different error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `next` only calls the `abortCb` function if `busy` is `false` and `aborted` is `true`, but the new code fragment calls it
