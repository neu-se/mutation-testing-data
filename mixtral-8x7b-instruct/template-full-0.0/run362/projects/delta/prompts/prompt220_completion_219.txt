 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.insert` is not null, while this change checks if it's not undefined. This might cause issues if the `op.insert` property can be explicitly set to `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.insert` is not null, while this change checks if it's a string. This might cause issues if the `op.insert` property can be set to a non-string value that is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert !== null && op.insert !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `op.insert` is not null, while this change checks if it's not null or undefined. This might cause issues if the `op.
