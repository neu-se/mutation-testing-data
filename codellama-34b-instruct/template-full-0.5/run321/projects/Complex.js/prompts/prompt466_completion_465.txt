  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this replacement checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` in cases where the original code fragment would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0 using the strict equality operator (`===`), while this replacement checks if `b` is equal to 0 using the abstract equality operator (`==`). This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` in cases where the original code fragment would have evaluated to `false`, and vice versa.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b`
