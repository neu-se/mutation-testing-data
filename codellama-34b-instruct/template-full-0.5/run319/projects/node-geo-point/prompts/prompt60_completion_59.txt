  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the bearing, while the replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the latitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the bearing, while the replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the latitude.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `tan` function to calculate the bearing, while the replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function to calculate the latitude.

DONE.
