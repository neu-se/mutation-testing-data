  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong substring, potentially resulting in a plural form that is not correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a substring that is too short, potentially resulting in a plural form that is not correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return a substring that is too long, potentially resulting in a plural form that is not correct.

DONE.
