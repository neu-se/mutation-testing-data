  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is the real part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a` instead of `b` would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real part, potentially leading to different results in the computation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a*2
```
This would result in different behavior because `a*2` is twice the real part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the imaginary part. Using `a*2` instead of `b` would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real part, potentially leading to different results in the computation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i*b
```
This would result in different behavior because `i*b` is the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas `b` is the real part. Using `i*b` instead of `b` would cause the resulting complex number to have
