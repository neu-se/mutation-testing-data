  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b === 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is not an object or null, while the new code fragment checks whether `b` is an object and not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is not an object or null, while the new code fragment checks whether `b` is an instance of the `Object` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) === '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether `b` is not an object or null, while the new code fragment checks whether the string representation of `b` is equal to `'[object Object]'`.

DONE.
