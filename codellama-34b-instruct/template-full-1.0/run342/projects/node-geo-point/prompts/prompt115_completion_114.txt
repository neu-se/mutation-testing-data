  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the longitude instead of the latitude to calculate the tile coordinates.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude / (180 / Math.PI)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different mathematical expression to convert the latitude from degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude * 3.141592 / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a different approximation of pi to convert the latitude from degrees to radians.

DONE.
