  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).thenReject
```
This would result in different behavior because `thenReject` will always reject the promise, regardless of the outcome of `callback.fcall(value)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` will always return a new promise, regardless of the outcome of `callback.fcall(value)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(value).then(function (val) { return val + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method will return a new promise that resolves to the result of the callback function, which is `val + 1`.

DONE.
