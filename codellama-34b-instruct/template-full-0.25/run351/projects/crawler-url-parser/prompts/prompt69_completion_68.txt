  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the protocol from the URL, which could cause issues if the URL is used for other purposes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the protocol with `http://`, which could cause issues if the URL is used for other purposes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sourceUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the protocol with `https://`, which could cause issues if the URL is used for other purposes.

DONE.
