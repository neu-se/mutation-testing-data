 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects an object and passing `null` would cause a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects an object and passing an empty array would not throw an error, but it would not provide the expected behavior either.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123
```
This would result in different behavior because the `get` method expects an object and passing a number would cause a TypeError.

DONE.
