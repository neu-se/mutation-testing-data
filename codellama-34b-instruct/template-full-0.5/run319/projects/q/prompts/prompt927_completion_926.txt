  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(null)` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the original array's elements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(undefined)` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `array_slice` is a function that returns a new array with a subset of the original array's elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice.bind(void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice.bind(void 0)` is a function that returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, whereas `array_slice
