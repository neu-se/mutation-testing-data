  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.split
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, while `replace` returns a string. If the function relies on the return value being a string, it could cause issues.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.toUpperCase
```
This would result in different behavior because `toUpperCase` returns a new string with all lowercase characters converted to uppercase, while the original code fragment does not have any uppercase characters. If the function relies on the presence or absence of uppercase characters, it could cause issues.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, while the original code fragment does not have any substring operations. If the function relies on the original string not being modified, it could cause issues.

DONE.
