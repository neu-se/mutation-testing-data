  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(λ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is not defined in the code snippet provided, and the `λ2` variable is not defined either.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `λ2` variable is not defined in the code snippet provided, and the `Math.PI` constant is not used in the original code fragment.

DONE.
