  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a `this` argument, whereas `fcall` does not. If a `this` argument is provided, it will be used as the `this` value for the callback function, which may cause unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` returns a new function with a bound `this` value, whereas `fcall` does not. The new function returned by `bind` may have a different behavior than the original callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` expects an array of arguments, whereas `fcall` expects a variable number of arguments. If an array of arguments is provided, it will be used as the arguments for the callback function, which may cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
