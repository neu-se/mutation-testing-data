  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result
```
This would result in different behavior because the `result` variable is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback` is a function that is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
errback
```
This would result in different behavior because `errback` is a function that is not defined in the current scope, and would cause a reference error.

DONE.
