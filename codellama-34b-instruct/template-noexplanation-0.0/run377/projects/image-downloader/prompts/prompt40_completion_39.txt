  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, flag: 'w' }
```
This code fragment creates a new file with the name `dest` and the flag `w` (write), which is different from the original code fragment that only specifies the filename. This change will cause the `createWriteStream` function to create a new file instead of overwriting the existing file, which may cause the test to fail if the file already exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This code fragment specifies the encoding of the file as `utf8`, which is different from the original code fragment that does not specify an encoding. This change may cause the test to fail if the file is not encoded in `utf8`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: dest, mode: 0o666 }
```
This code fragment specifies the file mode as `0o666`, which is different from the original
