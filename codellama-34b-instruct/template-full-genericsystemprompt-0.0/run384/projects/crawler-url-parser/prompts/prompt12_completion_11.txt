  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code fragment uses 'https://' to replace the protocol. This would cause the URL to be parsed as an HTTPS URL instead of an HTTP URL, which could result in different behavior in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + window.location.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses 'http://' to replace the protocol, while the new code fragment uses the current hostname to replace the protocol. This would cause the URL to be parsed as a URL with the current hostname instead of a URL with the protocol 'http://', which could result in different behavior in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://' + window.location.hostname + window.location.pathname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses '
