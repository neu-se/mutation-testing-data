  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` for any stack line that contains the string "(node.js:", which could include legitimate stack lines from other sources.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` only for stack lines that contain the string "(node.js:1", which is a more specific condition than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(node.js:1:1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `isNodeFrame` function to return `true` only for stack lines that contain the string "(node.js:1:1", which is an even more specific condition than the original code.

DONE.
