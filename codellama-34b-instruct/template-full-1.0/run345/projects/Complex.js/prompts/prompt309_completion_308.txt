  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of a value, while `Math.cos` returns the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `2 * Math.cos` would return twice the cosine of a value, shifting the output by a factor of 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` returns the tangent of a value, which is different from the cosine.

DONE.
