  Sure, I can do that. Here are my answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.inspect
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the current promise, rather than on the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the rejection to `untrackRejection`, rather than the `promise` that was passed to `trackRejection`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the promise that was rejected, rather than the rejection itself, to `untrackRejection`.

DONE.
