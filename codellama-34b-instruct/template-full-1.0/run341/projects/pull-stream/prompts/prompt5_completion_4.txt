  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.filter(function(item) {
  return item.prop === "value";
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it filters the items in the "throughs" array based on the value of their "prop" property, whereas the original code does not filter the items.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.map(function(item) {
  return item * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it maps the items in the "throughs" array to double their value, whereas the original code does not modify the items.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throughs.forEach(function(item) {
  console.log(item);
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs each item in the "throughs" array to the console, whereas the original code does not perform any action on the items.

DONE.
