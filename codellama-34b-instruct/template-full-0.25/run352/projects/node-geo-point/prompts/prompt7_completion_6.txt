  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') && !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator is used instead of the `||` operator, which would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object has either the `type` or `coordinates` property, but not both.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!point.hasOwnProperty('type') || !point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') || point.type !== 'Point'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator is used instead of the `&&` operator, which would cause the function to throw a `TypeError` if the `point` object has either the `type` or `coordinates` property, but not both. Additionally, the function would also throw a `TypeError` if the `point.type` property is not equal to `'Point'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOL
