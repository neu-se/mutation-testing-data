  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2) - sin(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the dot product of two vectors, while this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function, which would result in a different dot product value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) - cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `cos` function to calculate the dot product of two vectors, while this replacement code fragment uses the `sin` function, which would result in a different dot product value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) - sin(φ1) * sin(φ2) * cos(Δλ)
