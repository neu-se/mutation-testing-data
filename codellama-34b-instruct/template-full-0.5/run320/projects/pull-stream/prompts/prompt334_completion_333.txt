  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a `null` value as the first argument, which is not the same as the `end` value that the original code fragment would pass.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with an `undefined` value as the first argument, which is not the same as the `end` value that the original code fragment would pass.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function would be called with a `true` value as the first argument, which is not the same as the `end` value that the original code fragment would pass.

DONE.
