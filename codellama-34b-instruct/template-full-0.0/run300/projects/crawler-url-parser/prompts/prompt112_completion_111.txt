  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to `null` instead of the expected URL object, which could cause errors in the code that uses this variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = "http://example.com";
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to a hardcoded URL instead of the expected URL object, which could cause errors in the code that uses this variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = URL.parse(baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `currentUrl` variable would be initialized to the result of the `URL.parse()` method, which could return a different URL object than the expected one, which could cause errors in the code that uses this variable.

DONE.
