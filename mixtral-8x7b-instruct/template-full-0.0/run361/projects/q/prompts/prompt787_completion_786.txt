 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fail` function would immediately resolve instead of waiting for the input promise to reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Rejection'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.fail` function would immediately reject with a new error instead of waiting for the input promise to reject.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.all([])
