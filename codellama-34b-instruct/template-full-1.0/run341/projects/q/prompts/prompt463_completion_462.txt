  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the length of the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always look for the `unhandledReasons` array, rather than the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
