  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replaceAll
```
This would result in different behavior because `replaceAll` replaces all occurrences of the given string, whereas `replace` only replaces the first occurrence.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/[a-z]/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[a-z]/g` matches any letter in the alphabet, and the replacement string is empty, so all letters in the page URL path would be removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.replace(/[a-z]/g, "x")
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/[a-z]/g` matches any letter in the alphabet, and the replacement string is "x", so all letters in the page URL path would be replaced with "x".

DONE.
