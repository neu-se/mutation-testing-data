 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper || function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because if `mapper` is falsy, it would return an empty function instead of the `id` function. This could cause issues if the consumer of the `map` function expects the returned function to at least return the input for certain cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(mapper + '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert `mapper` to a string, which would break the expected functionality of the `mapper` function. This could expose a weakness in the test suite if it does not account for unexpected data types.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper(1, 2, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass unnecessary arguments to the `mapper` function, which may not be designed to handle more than one argument. This could expose a weakness in the test suite if it does not account for
