Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).chop();
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly calls the `chop` method as a function, which may lead to runtime errors or unexpected results, as the original code intended to return the result of the `chop` method without parentheses.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).slice(0, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from `chop` to `slice`, which alters the output by returning only the first element of the concatenated delta instead of processing the entire delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(rest).push(new Op());
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a new operation to the delta instead of chopping it, which would change the structure of the resulting delta by including an additional operation that was not part of the original logic.

DONE.
