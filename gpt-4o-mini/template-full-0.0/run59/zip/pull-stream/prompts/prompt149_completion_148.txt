Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(null)` will throw a TypeError, while `Object.keys(object)` would return an array of the object's keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(undefined)` will also throw a TypeError, whereas `Object.keys(object)` would return the keys of the provided object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys([])` will return an empty array, while `Object.keys(object)` would return the keys of the provided object, potentially leading to different results in the application logic.

DONE.
