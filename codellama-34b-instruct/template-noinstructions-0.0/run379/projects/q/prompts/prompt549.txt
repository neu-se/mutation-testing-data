/**
 * The async function is a decorator for generator functions, turning
 * them into asynchronous generators.  Although generators are only part
 * of the newest ECMAScript 6 drafts, this code does not cause syntax
 * errors in older engines.  This code should continue to work and will
 * in fact improve over time as the language improves.
 *
 * ES6 generators are currently part of V8 version 3.19 with the
 * --harmony-generators runtime flag enabled.  SpiderMonkey has had them
 * for longer, but under an older Python-inspired form.  This function
 * works on both kinds of generators.
 *
 * Decorates a generator function such that:
 *  - it may yield promises
 *  - execution will continue when that promise is fulfilled
 *  - the value of the yield expression will be the fulfilled value
 *  - it returns a promise for the return value (when the generator
 *    stops iterating)
 *  - the decorated function returns a promise for the return value
 *    of the generator or the first rejected promise among those
 *    yielded.
 *  - if an error is thrown in the generator, it propagates through
 *    every following yield until it is caught, or until it escapes
 *    the generator function altogether, and is translated into a
 *    rejection for the promise returned by the decorated generator.

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
result.done
```  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
