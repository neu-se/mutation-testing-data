  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the promise is fulfilled, while the new code fragment checks if the promise is rejected. This change would cause the `nearer` function to return the rejection reason instead of the fulfillment value, which would result in different behavior.

DONE.
