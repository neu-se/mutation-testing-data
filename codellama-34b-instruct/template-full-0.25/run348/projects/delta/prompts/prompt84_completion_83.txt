  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = lastOp.attributes;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the attributes of the last operation to the new operation, rather than merging them as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = Object.assign({}, lastOp.attributes, newOp.attributes);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the attributes of both the last operation and the new operation, rather than merging them as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.attributes = { ...lastOp.attributes, ...newOp.attributes };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the attributes of both the last operation and the new operation, rather than merging them as intended.

DONE.
