  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `diff` function would be called with the inverted `strings` array, which would cause the `eachLine` function to yield different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings.join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `strings` array would be flattened into a single string, which would cause the `eachLine` function to yield different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings.slice(1).join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the first element of the `strings` array would be removed, which would cause the `eachLine` function to yield different results.

DONE.
