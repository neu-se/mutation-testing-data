Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops === null || !Array.isArray(ops.ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it will incorrectly treat a valid `ops` object as invalid if `ops` is `null`, or if `ops.ops` is not an array, leading to an empty `this.ops` array instead of assigning `ops.ops`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops != null && typeof ops.ops === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will allow any object type for `ops.ops`, including non-array objects, which would bypass the intended check for an array, potentially causing runtime errors later in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops === undefined || Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `ops` is `undefined` instead of checking if `ops` is an object with an `ops` property, which would lead to incorrect initialization of `this.ops` when `ops` is an object that does not have the expected structure.

DONE.
