  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is now being called with the wrong arguments. The original code fragment called the callback function with `end` and `cb`, but the new code fragment calls it with `end` and `data`. This could cause the callback function to behave differently or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function is now being called with a different value for the `cb` parameter. The original code fragment called the callback function with `end` and `cb`, but the new code fragment calls it with `end` and `null`. This could cause the callback function to behave differently or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
