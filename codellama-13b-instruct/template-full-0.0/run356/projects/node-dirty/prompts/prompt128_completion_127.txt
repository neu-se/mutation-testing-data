  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork()` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to emit a `drain` event when the buffer becomes empty, even if the stream is not actually drained. This could cause the `drain` event to be emitted multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork()` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to buffer all writes until the `uncork()` method is called. This could cause the `drain` event to be emitted only once, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method is
