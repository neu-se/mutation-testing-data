  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the complementary trigonometric function `sin` instead of `cos`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(-point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the argument `point2Rad` as is instead of applying a negative sign to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tan(2 * point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the function `deg2rad` to convert the argument `point2` to radians, but the proposed code fragment uses the doubled value of `point2Rad` instead.

DONE.
