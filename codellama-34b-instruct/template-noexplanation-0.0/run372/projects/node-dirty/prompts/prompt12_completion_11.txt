  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value under a different key than the one provided, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.toUpperCase()
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value under a different key than the one provided, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value under a different key than the one provided, which may cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the `Dirty` class.

DONE.
