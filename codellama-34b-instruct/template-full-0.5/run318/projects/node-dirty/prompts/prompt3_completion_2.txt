  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
val == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `val == null` would also match `null` and `undefined`, while `val === undefined` only matches `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!val
```
This would result in different behavior because `!val` would also match any falsy value, not just `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof val === 'undefined'` would also match any variable that has not been declared, while `val === undefined` only matches variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value.

DONE.
