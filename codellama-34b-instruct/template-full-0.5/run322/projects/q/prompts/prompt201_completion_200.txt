  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different number of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
" "
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different number of spaces.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the resulting string would have a different number of backslashes.

DONE.
