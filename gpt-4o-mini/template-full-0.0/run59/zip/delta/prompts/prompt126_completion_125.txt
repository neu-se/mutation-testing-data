Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the loop to continue when `index` is greater than `start`, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds access or skipping operations that should be included.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the case where `index` is equal to `start`, which may cause the loop to terminate prematurely and miss processing some operations that should be iterated over.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === start
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the loop when `index` is exactly equal to `start`, which would prevent any operations from being processed if `index` is not equal to `start`, leading to incomplete results.

DONE.
