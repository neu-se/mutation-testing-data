  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation at the next index, rather than the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the operation at the previous index, rather than the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + Math.floor(Math.random() * (this.ops.length - this.index))];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random operation from the remaining operations in the list, rather than the current or next operation.

DONE.
