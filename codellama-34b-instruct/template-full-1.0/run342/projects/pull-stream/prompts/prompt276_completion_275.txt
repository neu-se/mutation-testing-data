  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nextStream` function instead of the `nextChunk` function, which would change the flow of the program and potentially cause it to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    if (err === true) nextStream()
    else read(true, function(abortErr) {
      // TODO: what do we do with the abortErr?
      cb(err)
    })
  }
  else cb(null, data)
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_read` function with a null error and a function as the second argument, which would change the way the error is handled and potentially cause the program to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, function(end
