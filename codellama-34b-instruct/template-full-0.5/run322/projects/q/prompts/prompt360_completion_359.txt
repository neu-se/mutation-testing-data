  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `done`, so the code inside the `if` block would be executed even if `done` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code inside the `if` block if `done` is strictly equal to `true`, which is not necessarily the case if `done` is just truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only execute the code inside the `if` block if `done` is strictly equal to `false`, which is not necessarily the case if `done` is just falsy.

DONE.
