  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with `undefined` as the new promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with `null` as the new promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `become` function would be called with a rejected promise, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

DONE.
