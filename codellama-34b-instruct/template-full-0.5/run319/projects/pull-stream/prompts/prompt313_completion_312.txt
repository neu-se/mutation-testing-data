  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a different value than null, and it would cause the function to return undefined instead of null, which could potentially cause issues downstream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because false is a different value than null, and it would cause the function to return false instead of null, which could potentially cause issues downstream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because NaN (Not a Number) is a different value than null, and it would cause the function to return NaN instead of null, which could potentially cause issues downstream.

DONE.
