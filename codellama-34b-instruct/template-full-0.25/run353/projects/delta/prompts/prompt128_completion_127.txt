  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start + index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus operator, while this replacement uses the plus operator. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to different behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start * index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus operator, while this replacement uses the multiplication operator. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
start / index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the minus operator, while this replacement uses the division operator. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to different behavior in the code.

DONE.
