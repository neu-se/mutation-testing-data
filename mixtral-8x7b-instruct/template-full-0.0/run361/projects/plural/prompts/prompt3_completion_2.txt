 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'-0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return `'Number'` instead of `'String'` for the number `0`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `type` function would return `'Number'` instead of `'String'` for the string `'0'`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.prototype.toString.call(obj).slice(8, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty string instead of the object type.

DONE.
