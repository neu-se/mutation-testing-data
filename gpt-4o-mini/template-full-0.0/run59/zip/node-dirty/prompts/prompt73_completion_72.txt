Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a different error code related to permission issues instead of the file not found error, which would lead to the `load` event being emitted even when the file does not exist.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.message.includes('not found')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the error message contains the phrase 'not found' rather than checking the specific error code, which could lead to false positives if other errors contain that phrase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOTDIR'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an error code indicating that a component of the path is not a directory, which is unrelated to the file existence check and would not trigger the same handling as the original code.

DONE.
