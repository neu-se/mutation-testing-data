  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
someOtherVariable
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an undefined value to the `getCountryForTimezone` function, which may cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
