  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reset the `options` object to an empty object, causing the `getCountriesForTimezone` function to return an empty array instead of an array of countries.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property of the `options` object to `true`, causing the `deliverTimezones` function to return an empty object instead of an object with only non-deprecated timezones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options = { allTimezones: false }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the `allTimezones` property of the `options` object to `false`, causing the `getCountryForTimezone` function to return `null` instead of a country object.

DONE.
