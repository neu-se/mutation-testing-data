  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done(end === true ? null : end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` would call the `done` callback with the `end` argument, while the new code fragment `done(end === true ? null : end)` would call the `done` callback with `null` if `end` is `true`, and with `end` otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `done` would call the `done` callback with the `end` argument, while the new code fragment `done(end === false ? null : end)` would call the `done` callback with `null` if `end` is `false`, and with `end` otherwise.
