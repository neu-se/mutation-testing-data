  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start at index 1 instead of 0, which would return a different substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start at index -1, which would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would start at index "hello", which would return an empty string.

DONE.
