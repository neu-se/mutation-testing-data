  Delta.something()
This would result in different behavior because something() is not a Delta method.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length
```
This would result in different behavior because length is a method of the Delta class.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because toString() is a method of the Delta class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is the value of the delta.ops array when it is empty.

DONE.
