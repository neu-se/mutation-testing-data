  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^#.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` anchor matches the start of the string, so the regex would only match if the `#` character is the first character in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag makes the regex case-insensitive, so the regex would match both uppercase and lowercase `#` characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/#.*$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag makes the regex global, so the regex would match all occurrences of `#` in the string, not just the first one.

DONE.
