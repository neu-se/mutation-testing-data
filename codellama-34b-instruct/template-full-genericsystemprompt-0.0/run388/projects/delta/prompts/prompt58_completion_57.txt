  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Array.isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the result of `Array.isArray`, causing the code to behave as if the input is not an array, even if it actually is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(null)` would return `false`, causing the code to behave as if the input is not an array, even if it actually is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(undefined)` would return `false`, causing the code to behave as if the input is not an array, even if it actually is.

DONE.
