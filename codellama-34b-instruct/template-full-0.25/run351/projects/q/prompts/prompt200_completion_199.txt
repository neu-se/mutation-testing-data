  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into individual characters, rather than lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(" ").length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into individual words and count the number of words, rather than lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into lines, but then remove the first line, rather than keeping it.

DONE.
