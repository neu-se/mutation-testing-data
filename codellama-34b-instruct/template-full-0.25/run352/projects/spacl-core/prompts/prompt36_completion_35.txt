  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(2).reverse
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first segment of the path, which could cause the matcher to fail to recognize certain paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments of the path with a forward slash, which could cause the matcher to fail to recognize certain paths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would join the segments of the path with an empty string, which could cause the matcher to fail to recognize certain paths.

DONE.
