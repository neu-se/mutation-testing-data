  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would decrement the length of the `ops` array by 1, which could cause the `push` method to insert the new operation at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would increment the length of the `ops` array by 1, which could cause the `push` method to insert the new operation at the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the `ops` array, which could cause the `push` method to insert the new operation at the wrong index.

DONE.
