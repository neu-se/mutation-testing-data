  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_reduce` is a different function than `array_slice`. `array_reduce` is used to reduce an array to a single value, while `array_slice` is used to extract a subset of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_map` is a different function than `array_slice`. `array_map` is used to apply a function to each element of an array, while `array_slice` is used to extract a subset of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` is a different function than `array_slice`. `array_filter` is used to extract elements from an array that meet a certain condition, while `array_slice` is used to extract a subset of an array.

DONE.
