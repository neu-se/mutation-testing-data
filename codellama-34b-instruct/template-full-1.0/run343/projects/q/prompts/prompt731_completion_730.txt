  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: "foo", value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would always be the string "foo", instead of the actual index of the promise in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index + 1, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be one greater than the actual index of the promise in the array, which could cause unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ index: index * 2, value: progress }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `index` property would be twice the actual index of the promise in the array, which could cause unexpected results.

DONE.
