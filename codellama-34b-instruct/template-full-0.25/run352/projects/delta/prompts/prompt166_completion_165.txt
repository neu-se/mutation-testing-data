  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the type of the next operation in the iterator, while this replacement would check for the type of the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking for the type of the next operation in the other iterator, while this replacement would check for the type of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was checking if the length of the next operation in the iterator was greater than 0, while this replacement would check if the length of the current operation was greater than 0.

DONE.
