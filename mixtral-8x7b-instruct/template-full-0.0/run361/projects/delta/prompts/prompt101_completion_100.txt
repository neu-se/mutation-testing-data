 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length--
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly decrements the `length` property of the `ops` array, but does not remove the last element. This can lead to inconsistency between the actual length and the stored length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.slice(-1)[0] = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the last element of the `ops` array to `undefined` instead of removing it. This can lead to unexpected behavior when processing the operations, as the last operation would still be present but with a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.splice(-1, 1, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last element and replaces it with an empty object. This can lead to unexpected behavior when processing the operations, as the last operation would be replaced
