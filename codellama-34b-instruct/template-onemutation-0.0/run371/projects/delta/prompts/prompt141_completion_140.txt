  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength` is a method that returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `peekLength` is a property that returns the length of the current operation in the iterator. Using the method instead of the property would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
