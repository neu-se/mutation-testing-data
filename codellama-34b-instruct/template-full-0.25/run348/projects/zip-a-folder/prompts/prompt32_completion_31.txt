  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data has been written to the output stream, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error while writing to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finish` event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data has been written to the output stream, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error while writing to the output stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` event is emitted when the archive is finalized and all data has been written to the output stream, whereas the `error` event is emitted when there is an error while writing to the output stream.

DONE.
