 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `Complex['INFINITY']` for subtraction, even if neither number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `isInfinite` method on the current complex number, rather than the number being subtracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, causing the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` for any subtraction operation.

DONE.
