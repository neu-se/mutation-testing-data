  A good option would be to replace the literal number 1 on line 15 with the literal number 0 (for example). This would cause the function to return a different result than it was designed to do, and could potentially cause failures in any test suites that rely on this function. This could help identify flaws in the test suite and lead to improved test coverage.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different result than it was designed to do. 

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would throw an error when attempting to operate on a value that is not a number. 

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return undefined instead of a value, which could cause unexpected behavior in any code that relies on this function.

DONE.
