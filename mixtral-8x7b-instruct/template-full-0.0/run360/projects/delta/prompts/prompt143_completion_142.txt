 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operation would change the length value, causing the `slice` and `compose` methods to potentially select/combine different operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operation would change the length value, causing the `slice` and `compose` methods to potentially select/combine different operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.length` returns the total number of operations in the iterator, not the length of the current operation. This would cause the `slice` and `compose` methods to potentially select/combine different operations.

DONE.
