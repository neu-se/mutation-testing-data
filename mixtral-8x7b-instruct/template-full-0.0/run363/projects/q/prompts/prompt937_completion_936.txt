 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would receive an incorrect number of arguments, causing unexpected behavior or errors in the `Q.nbind` and `Promise.prototype.nbind` methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function expects a number as its first argument, and `null` would cause an error in both `Q.nbind` and `Promise.prototype.nbind` methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.nbind
