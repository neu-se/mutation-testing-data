Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling or errors during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an empty object instead of the actual attributes would change how the attributes are processed, likely resulting in loss of information or incorrect attribute mapping during the inversion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would default to an empty object if `op.attributes` is `undefined`, which could lead to different outcomes in the inversion logic, especially if the original attributes were expected to be present for proper processing.

DONE.
