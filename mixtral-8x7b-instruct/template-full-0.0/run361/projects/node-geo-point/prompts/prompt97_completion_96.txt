 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(φ1) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the formula for calculating the new latitude by introducing a division operation, which can lead to different results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ) * Math.exp(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an exponential function, which is not present in the original formula, leading to different results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(θ) * φ1
