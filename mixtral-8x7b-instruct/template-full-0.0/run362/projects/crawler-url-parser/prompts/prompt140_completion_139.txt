 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/.*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it will match any string ending with a slash, instead of only matching strings ending with "/default.extension".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/default\.[a-z]+$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it makes the regex case-insensitive, which could lead to unexpected matches if the URL contains uppercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/[a-z]+\.[a-z]+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string ending with a slash followed by a word consisting of lowercase letters and a period, which is more permissive than the original regex.

DONE.
