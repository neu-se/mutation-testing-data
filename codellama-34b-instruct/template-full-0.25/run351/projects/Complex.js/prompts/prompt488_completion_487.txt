  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `false`, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule" + "1"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return `true`, regardless of the input.

DONE.
