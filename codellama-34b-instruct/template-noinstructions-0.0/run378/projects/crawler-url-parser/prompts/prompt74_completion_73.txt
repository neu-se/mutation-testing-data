  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the `base` element, but the new code fragment is using the `attr` method to set the `href` attribute of the `base` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href', 'http://example.com')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the `base` element, but the new code fragment is using the `attr` method to set the `href` attribute of the `base` element to a specific value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').removeAttr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `attr` method to get the `href` attribute of the `base`
