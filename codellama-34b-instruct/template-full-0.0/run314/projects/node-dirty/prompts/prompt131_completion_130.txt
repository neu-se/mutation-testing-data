  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a different object than `this._queue`, and the code that uses the PLACEHOLDER assumes that it is iterating over the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.size()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.size()` is a method that returns the number of elements in the queue, whereas `this._queue` is an object that contains the elements of the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._queue.pop()` removes the last element from the queue, whereas `this._queue` is an object that contains all the elements of the queue.

DONE.
