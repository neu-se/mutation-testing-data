 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value of the second argument in the array by multiplying it with zero, making it equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the third argument in the array instead of the second one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref['1']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the second argument in the array using a string key instead of an integer index.

DONE.
