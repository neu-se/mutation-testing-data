  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function () {
    throw new Error("Rejection handled");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this new code fragment throws an error when the rejected promise is handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function () {
    return Q.reject("Rejection handled");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a new rejected promise with a different reason.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function () {
    return Q.resolve("Rejection handled");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply returns the rejected promise, while this new code fragment returns a resolved promise with a different value.

DONE.
