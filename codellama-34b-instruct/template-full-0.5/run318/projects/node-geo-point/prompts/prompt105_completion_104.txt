  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is decreased by 1, which would cause the tile coordinates to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is increased by 1, which would cause the tile coordinates to be calculated incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(coordinate.longitude + 180) / 360 * Math.pow(2, zoom * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the zoom level is doubled, which would cause the tile coordinates to be calculated incorrectly.

DONE.
