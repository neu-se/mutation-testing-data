  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object and also passes an array of arguments. This could cause the method to be invoked with different arguments than intended, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post" method to invoke a method on an object, while the buggy code fragment uses the "apply" method to invoke a method on an object and also passes an array of arguments. This could cause the method to be invoked with different arguments than intended, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the "post"
