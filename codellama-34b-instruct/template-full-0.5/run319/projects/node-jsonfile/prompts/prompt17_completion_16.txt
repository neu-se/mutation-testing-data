  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is a string, while the modified code fragment checks if `options` is not a string. This would cause the `if` statement to execute in the opposite cases, which could potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is a string, while the modified code fragment checks if `options` has a non-zero length. This would cause the `if` statement to execute in the opposite cases, which could potentially lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is a string, while the modified code fragment checks if `options.encoding` is not undefined. This would cause the `if` statement to execute in
