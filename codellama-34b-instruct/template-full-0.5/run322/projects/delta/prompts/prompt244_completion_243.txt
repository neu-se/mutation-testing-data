  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.delete` would delete the current operation from the iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would move the iterator to the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.delete` would delete the current operation from the other iterator, whereas `thisIter.next` would move the iterator to the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` would move the other iterator to the next operation, whereas `thisIter.next` would move the current iterator to the next operation.

DONE.
