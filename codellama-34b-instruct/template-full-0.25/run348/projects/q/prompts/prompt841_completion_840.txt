  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which could cause the function to behave differently or produce an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which could cause the function to behave differently or produce an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, onUnhandledError
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `onUnhandledError` function to be called with `0` as the first argument, which could cause the function to behave differently or produce an error.

DONE.
