  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the source of the source, rather than the source itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the source of the source of the source, rather than the source itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.source.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate over the source of the source of the source of the source, rather than the source itself.

DONE.
