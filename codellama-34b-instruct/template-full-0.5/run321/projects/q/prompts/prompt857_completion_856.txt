  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function from `clearTimeout`, and would not clear the timeout set by `setTimeout`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` would create a new timeout, rather than clearing the existing one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `setInterval` would create a new interval, rather than clearing the existing timeout.

DONE.
