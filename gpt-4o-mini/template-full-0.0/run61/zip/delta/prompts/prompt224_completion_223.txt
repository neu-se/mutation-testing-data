Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the cursor position as the start of the string, potentially leading to incorrect diffs when the actual cursor position is not at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the cursor would likely cause the diff function to behave unexpectedly, possibly leading to errors or incorrect results when trying to access properties or methods that expect a valid cursor value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because using `-1` as the cursor would imply an invalid position, which could lead to incorrect calculations or an attempt to access elements outside the bounds of the strings being compared, resulting in potential runtime errors or incorrect diffs.

DONE.
