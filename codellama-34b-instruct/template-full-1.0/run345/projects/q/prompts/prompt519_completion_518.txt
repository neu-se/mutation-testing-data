  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fail
```
This would result in different behavior because fail() is a method in Q.js library that rejects a promise, whereas notify() is a method that sends progress updates to the promise's fulfillment handlers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because resolve() is a method that fulfills a promise with a given value, whereas notify is used to send progress updates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because reject() is a method that rejects a promise with a given error, whereas notify() is used to send progress updates.

DONE.
