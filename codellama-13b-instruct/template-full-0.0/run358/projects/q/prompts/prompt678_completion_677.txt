  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `object` variable. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `object` variable is not a `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` object, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `object` variable with the arguments `["get", [key]]`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `object` variable is not a `Q` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value])
```
