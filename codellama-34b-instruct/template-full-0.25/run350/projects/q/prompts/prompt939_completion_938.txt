  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` adds an element to the end of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, while `concat()` returns a new array that is the result of concatenating the two arrays.

DONE.
