  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft &&
        thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This modification ensures that the loop will continue as long as there are insert operations left in the iterator and the length of the current operation is less than or equal to the remaining length of the first operation in the other iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() <= firstLeft &&
        thisIter.peekLength() > 0 &&
        thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This modification ensures that the loop will continue as long as there are insert operations left in the iterator, the length of the current operation is less than or equal to the remaining length of the first operation in the other iterator, and the length of the current operation is less than the remaining length of the first operation in the other iterator.

Option 3:
