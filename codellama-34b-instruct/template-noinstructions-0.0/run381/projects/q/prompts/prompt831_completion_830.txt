  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled, which would cause the `then` method to be skipped and the `catch` method to be called instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with the value `undefined` instead of the original value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with the value `null` instead of the original value, which could cause unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
