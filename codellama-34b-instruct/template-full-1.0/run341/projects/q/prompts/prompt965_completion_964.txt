  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function nbindFix(callback, thisp) {
    var baseArgs = array_slice(arguments, 2);
    return function () {
        var nodeArgs = baseArgs.concat(array_slice(arguments));
        nodeArgs.push(makeNodeResolver());
        function bound() {
            return callback.apply(thisp, arguments);
        }
        Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).done();
    };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original `nbind` implementation uses `defer()` to create a new deferred object, whereas this modified implementation uses `makeNodeResolver()` directly. This could cause issues if the promise returned by `nbind` is not properly resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function nbindFix(callback, thisp) {
    var baseArgs
