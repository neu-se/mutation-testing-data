  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the sum of `a` and `b`, regardless of their values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the product of `a` and `b`, regardless of their values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the quotient of `a` and `b`, regardless of their values.

DONE.
