 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for an empty operation instead of checking if there are no more operations left in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
otherIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a delete operation instead of checking if the other operation is an insert.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
isEqual(delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 2], newOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the second last operation in the delta instead of the last one.

DONE.
