  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the imaginary component of the complex number instead of the real component.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the absolute value of the complex number instead of the real component.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-z['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negative of the real component of the complex number.

DONE.
