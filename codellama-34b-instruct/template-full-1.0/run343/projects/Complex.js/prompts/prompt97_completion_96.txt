  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `NaN`, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `Infinity`, regardless of the input arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid input");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the input arguments are invalid, instead of returning a value.

DONE.
