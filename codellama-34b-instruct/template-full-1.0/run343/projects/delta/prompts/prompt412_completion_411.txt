  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 PiCalc.calculate(operators, operands, result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `calculate` function is not defined in the code, and thus, it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 PiCalc.use(operators, operands, result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `use` function is not defined in the code, and thus, it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 PiCalc.parse(operators, operands, result)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` function is not defined in the code, and thus, it would throw an error.

DONE.
