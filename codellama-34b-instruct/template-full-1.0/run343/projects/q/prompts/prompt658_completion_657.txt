  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would treat the first argument as the argument count and ignore any additional arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would treat the first argument as the argument count and ignore any additional arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would treat the first argument as the argument count and ignore any additional arguments.

Please make your changes and provide your rationale for each option.
