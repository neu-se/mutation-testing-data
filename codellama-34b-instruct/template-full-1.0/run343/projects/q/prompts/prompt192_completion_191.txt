  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.replace(/@/g, "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all @ symbols from the stackLine, potentially causing the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the stackLine as a number, rather than the stackLine itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split("")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of single characters that make up the stackLine, rather than the stackLine itself.

DONE.
