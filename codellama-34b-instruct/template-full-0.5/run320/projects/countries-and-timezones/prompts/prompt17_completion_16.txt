  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `tz.r` is a different value than `id`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aliasTz.r
```
This would result in different behavior because `aliasTz.r` is a different value than `id`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `countries[0]` is a different value than `id`.

DONE.
