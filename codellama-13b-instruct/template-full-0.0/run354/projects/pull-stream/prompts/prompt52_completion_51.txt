  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is now being accessed through its `source` property, which may have a different value or behavior than the original `read` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is now being accessed through its `sink` property, which may have a different value or behavior than the original `read` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `read` variable is now being accessed through its `source` property, which may have a different value or behavior than the original `read` variable, and then through its `sink` property, which may have a different value or behavior than the original `read` variable.

DONE.
