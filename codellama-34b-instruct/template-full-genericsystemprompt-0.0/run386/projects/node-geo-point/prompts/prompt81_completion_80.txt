  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the latitude instead of the longitude, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 10 to the longitude, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the longitude, which would cause the calculation to be incorrect.

DONE.
