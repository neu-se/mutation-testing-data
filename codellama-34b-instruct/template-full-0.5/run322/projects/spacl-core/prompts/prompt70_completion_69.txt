  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` method will convert the path to lowercase, which may not be the intended behavior for the rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring(1)` method will return the substring starting from the second character, which may not be the intended behavior for the rule.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `split('/')` method will split the path by `/` and `pop()` method will return the last element of the array, which may not be the intended behavior for the rule.

DONE.
