 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function would be called with a `null` value for `baseUrlStr`, which could cause different code execution paths and potentially expose missing or incorrect tests.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"some_string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` function expects a string as the second argument, and passing a string instead of a variable might cause different code execution paths and expose missing or incorrect tests.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => "some_string"
```
This would result in different behavior because `parse` function expects a string as the second argument, and passing a function that returns a string will cause an error, which could expose missing error handling or incorrect tests.

DONE.
