  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === '+'` would cause the parser to exit if it encounters a plus sign in the input string, even if the plus sign is part of a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === ' ' || c === '\t' || c === '\n' || c === 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `c === 'e'` would cause the parser to exit if it encoun
