Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'$$'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only escape a single '$' character instead of two, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
targetPath
```
This would result in different behavior because it would directly use the `targetPath` variable instead of replacing the '$' character, potentially leading to incorrect path construction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the escaping of the '$' character altogether, potentially leading to incorrect path replacements or errors when the '$' character is used in the path.

DONE.
