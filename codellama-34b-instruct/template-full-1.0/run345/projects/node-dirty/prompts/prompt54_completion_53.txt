  The goal of mutation testing is to identify test cases that show issues or weaknesses in the code. As an expert in mutation testing, you can suggest different code fragments that would change the behavior of the original code and test for these mutations to identify issues in the test suite.

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that would result in different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this.set
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.set` is a function that sets a value in the database, but it is not equivalent to `this.once`, which is an event emitter that emits an event when the stream is drained.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```js
this._data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._data` is a map, and it does not have a `length` property. Accessing `this._data.length` would return `undefined`, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option
