  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method without a second argument returns a new string with the same starting index as the original string, but with a length of 1. This means that the new error message would be missing the first character of the buffer, which could cause the test to fail if the first character is important for determining the validity of the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}.slice(1)`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is called on a string that is not a variable, but rather a concatenation of a string and a variable. This could cause the test to fail if the string part is important for determining the validity of the data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error
