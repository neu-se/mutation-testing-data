  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 100
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at 100 instead of 0, and would skip the first 100 elements of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at -1 and would potentially access negative indices of the array, which would result in an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = len
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, as the condition `i < len` would be false from the start.

DONE.
