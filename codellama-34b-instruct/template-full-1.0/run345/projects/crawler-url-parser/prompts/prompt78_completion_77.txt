  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('#a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all elements with the id "a", instead of all links within the current element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$.find('a')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would search for all elements with the tag name "a" within the current element, instead of all links.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
$('a').not(':visible')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select all links that are not visible, instead of all links.

DONE.
