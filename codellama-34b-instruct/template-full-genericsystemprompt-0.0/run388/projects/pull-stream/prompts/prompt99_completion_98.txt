  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is strictly equal to `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is not strictly equal to `true`.

DONE.
