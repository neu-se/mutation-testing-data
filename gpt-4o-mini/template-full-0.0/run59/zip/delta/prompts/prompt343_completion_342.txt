Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandlerFallback
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to a different method that may not handle the transformation correctly, potentially leading to incorrect data being retained or transformed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as an argument may cause the method to return an unexpected result or throw an error, disrupting the intended transformation process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.getHandler(embedType + 'Extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `embedType` by appending 'Extra', which likely does not correspond to any valid handler, leading to a failure in the transformation logic.

DONE.
