  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = task;
```
This change will cause the task to be added to the head of the linked list, rather than the tail, which is the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tail.task = task;
```
This change will cause the task to be added to the tail of the linked list, which is the original behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
head.task = task;
tail.task = task;
```
This change will cause the task to be added to both the head and tail of the linked list, which is not the original behavior.

DONE.
