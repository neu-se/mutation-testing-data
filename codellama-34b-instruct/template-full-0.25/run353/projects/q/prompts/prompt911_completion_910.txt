  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` creates a new array by combining the elements of two or more arrays, while `push` adds new elements to the end of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` combines the elements of two or more arrays, while `splice` adds new elements to an array at a specified position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` combines the elements of two or more arrays, while `unshift` adds new elements to the beginning of an array.

DONE.
