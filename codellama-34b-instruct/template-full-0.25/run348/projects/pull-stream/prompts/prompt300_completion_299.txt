  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!ended
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `ended`, so if `ended` is `true`, `!ended` would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator returns the first falsy value, so if `ended` is `true`, `ended && false` would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `cb` function to be called with a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ended || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator returns the first truthy value, so if `ended` is `true`, `
