  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word with the last two characters removed and then add an 'i', while the new code fragment would return the word with the last character removed and then add an 'i'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ii' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return the word with the last two characters removed and then add an 'i', while the new code fragment would return the word with the last two characters removed and then add two 'i's.
