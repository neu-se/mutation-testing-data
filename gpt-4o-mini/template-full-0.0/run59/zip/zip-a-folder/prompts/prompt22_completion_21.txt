Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions || !zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the absence of `zipAFolderOptions` or `customWriteStream`, which would lead to the code executing the error case instead of using the provided custom write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `customWriteStream` is explicitly `null`, which would allow the code to proceed as if no custom write stream was provided, even if `zipAFolderOptions` exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions && zipAFolderOptions.customWriteStream !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `customWriteStream` is not `undefined`, which would incorrectly allow the code to proceed even if `customWriteStream` is set to a falsy value like `null` or `0`, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
