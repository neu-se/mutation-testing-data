  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `args` array directly, while this suggestion would add 1 to each element of the `args` array before passing it to `promise[name]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `args` array directly, while this suggestion would resolve a promise with the `args` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.map(Q.resolve)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `args` array directly, while this suggestion would resolve a promise with each element of the `args` array.

DONE.
