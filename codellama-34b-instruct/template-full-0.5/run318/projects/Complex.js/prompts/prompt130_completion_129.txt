  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` if either `this` or `z` is infinite, regardless of whether the other is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `true` if `this` is not infinite and `z` is infinite.

DONE.
