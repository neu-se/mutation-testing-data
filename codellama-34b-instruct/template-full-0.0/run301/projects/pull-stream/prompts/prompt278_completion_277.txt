  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is strictly equal to `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper !== mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is not equal to itself, which is always false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!mapper && mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `mapper` is falsy and then tries to access it as a truthy value.

DONE.
