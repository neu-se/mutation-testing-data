  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise, while this new code fragment checks the length of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise, while this new code fragment adds 1 to the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is a promise, while this new code fragment converts the value to a string.

DONE.
