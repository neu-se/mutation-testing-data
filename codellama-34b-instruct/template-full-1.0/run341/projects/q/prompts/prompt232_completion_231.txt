  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select a different element of the `operands` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the value of `operands[1]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operation[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would select the element of the `operation` array called "operands".

DONE.
