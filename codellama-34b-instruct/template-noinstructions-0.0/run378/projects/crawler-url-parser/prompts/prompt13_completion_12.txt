```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "https://". This could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the "https://" protocol.

```
/^\/\//, 'file://'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment replaces the protocol with "http://", while this new code fragment replaces it with "file://". This could cause issues if the URL being parsed is not compatible with the "file
