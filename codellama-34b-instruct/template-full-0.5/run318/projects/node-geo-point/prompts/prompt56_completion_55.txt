  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the constant `1`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to always return `1`, regardless of the input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the `sin` function, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to use the sine of the latitude and longitude values instead of the cosine.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos` function would be replaced with the constant `Math.PI`, which would cause the calculation of the bearing to always return `Math.PI`, regardless of the input values.

DONE.
