  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.slice(0, 1).peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new slice of the iterator, rather than using the existing one, which could cause issues with the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext() ? otherIter.peekLength() : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if there are any more operations in the iterator, and if not, it would return 0, rather than the length of the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.max(otherIter.peekLength(), 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a maximum length of 10, rather than the length of the current operation, which could cause issues with the logic of the code.

DONE.
