 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is not being considered in the rounding operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is being replaced with the real part, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * places
```
This would result in different behavior because a random number is being used instead of the imaginary part of the complex number, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
