  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.size - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a value that is one less than the actual size of the data, potentially causing problems with data retrieval and storage.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the database to load incorrectly, potentially causing data to be lost or corrupted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the database to load incorrectly, potentially causing data to be lost or corrupted.

DONE.
