  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onUnhandledError()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onUnhandledError` function would be called immediately, rather than being passed as a callback to `then`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as a callback to `then`, rather than the intended `onUnhandledError` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would be passed as a callback to `then`, rather than the intended `onUnhandledError` function.

DONE.
