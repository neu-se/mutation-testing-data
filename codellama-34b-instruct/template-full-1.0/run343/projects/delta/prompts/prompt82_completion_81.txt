  Option 1: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
newOp.each(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new operation to the Delta object, which would cause the `insert` method to return `this.ops.length`, which would no longer be equal to the original code fragment.

Option 2: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert a null value instead of the original value, which would cause the `insert` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The `PLACEHOLDER` can be replaced with:
```
newOp.retain(newOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the entire length of the operation instead of just the next operation, which would cause the `insert` method to return a different result.

DONE.
