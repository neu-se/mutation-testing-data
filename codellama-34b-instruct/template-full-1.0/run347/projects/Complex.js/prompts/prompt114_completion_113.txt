  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        if (!Number.isFinite(a['r'])) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if both `a['r']` and `a['phi']` are finite, while this new code only checks if `a['r']` is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        if (Math.abs(a['r']) > 1e6) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returned `Complex['INFINITY']` when `a['r']` is not finite, while this new code returns `Complex['INFINITY']` when the absolute value of `a['r']` is greater than 1e6.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        if (a['r'] === Infinity) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checked if `a['r']` is not finite, while this new code checks if
