  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value]
```
This would result in different behavior because `get` returns a promise for the property value, while `dispatch` returns a promise for the return value of the operation. Using `value` instead of `key` would reflect this semantic difference.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[object[key]]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reference the property value directly instead of returning a promise for it. This would only work if `object` and `key` are both immediate references and not promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key.valueOf()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the result of calling `valueOf` on the key instead of the key itself. This would only work if `key` is an object with a `valueOf` function that has a significant return value.

DONE.
