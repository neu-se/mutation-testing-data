  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `var k`, which declared a variable `k` without initializing it. In contrast, `var k = 0` initializes `k` to 0, which could cause the code to behave differently if `k` is used in a way that depends on its initial value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `var k`, which declared a variable `k` without initializing it. In contrast, `var k = null` initializes `k` to `null`, which could cause the code to behave differently if `k` is used in a way that depends on its initial value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `var k`, which declared a variable `k` without initializing it.
