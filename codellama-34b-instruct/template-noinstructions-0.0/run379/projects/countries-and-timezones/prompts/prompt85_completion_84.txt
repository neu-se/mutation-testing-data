  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an array of `null` values instead of an array of country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an array of empty objects instead of an array of country objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountriesForTimezone` function would return an array of `undefined` values instead of an array of country objects.

DONE.
