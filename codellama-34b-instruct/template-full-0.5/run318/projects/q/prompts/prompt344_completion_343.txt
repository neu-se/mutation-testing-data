  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value as is, while this replacement adds 1 to the value before returning it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value as is, while this replacement multiplies the value by 2 before returning it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the value as is, while this replacement converts the value to a string before returning it.

DONE.
