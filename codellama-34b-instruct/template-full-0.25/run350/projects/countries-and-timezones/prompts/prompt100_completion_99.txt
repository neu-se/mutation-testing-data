  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(tzs).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(tzs).length` would return the number of keys in the `tzs` object, while `tzs` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `tzs.length` would return the length of the `tzs` array, while `tzs` would return the array itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(tzs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values(tzs)` would return an array of the values in the `tzs` object, while `tzs` would return the object itself.

DONE.
