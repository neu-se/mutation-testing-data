  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, which means it would always return `true` if `c` is not equal to `+`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c < '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator checks for less than, which means it would return `true` if `c` is less than `+`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator checks for greater than, which means it would return `true` if `c` is greater than `+`.

DONE.
