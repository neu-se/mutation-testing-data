  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.search(/:.+/) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `search()` method searches for a substring in a string and returns its index, while `match()` method returns the matches as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/:\w+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match()` method matches the entire string, while `:\w+` matches only word characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.match(/\W+/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `\W+` matches any non-word character, while `:.+` matches colons followed by any character.

DONE.
