 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => memoizeTimezone(buildTimezone(data, name))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function expression, which could cause issues with closures or variable scoping.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
memoizeTimezone(data, buildTimezone(data, name))
