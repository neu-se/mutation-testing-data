  
Option 1:
```
w.replace(/[aeiouy]o$/i,'es')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression will match a different pattern, resulting in a different replacement string being returned.

Option 2:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 1) + 'es'
```
This would result in different behavior because the substring() method is being used to generate a different string than the w.replace() method.

Option 3:
```
addRule(w.split('e').length > 1, 'es')
```
This would result in different behavior because the split() method is being used to decide whether to return the original string or the replacement string, based on the presence of the letter 'e' in the input string.

DONE.
