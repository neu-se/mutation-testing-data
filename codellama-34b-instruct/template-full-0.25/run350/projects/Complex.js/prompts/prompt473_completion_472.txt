  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of checking if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] * this['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the real and imaginary parts of the complex number instead of checking if they are equal.

DONE.
