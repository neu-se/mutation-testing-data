Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the expected return value from an empty array to an array containing a single `null` value, which could lead to unexpected results when the calling code attempts to process the keys of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of an empty array would cause the promise to resolve with `undefined`, which is not a valid response for the keys of an object, potentially leading to errors in subsequent operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["unexpectedKey"]
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns an array with a string `"unexpectedKey"` instead of the actual keys of the object, which could mislead the caller into thinking that the object has a property that it does not actually possess.

DONE.
