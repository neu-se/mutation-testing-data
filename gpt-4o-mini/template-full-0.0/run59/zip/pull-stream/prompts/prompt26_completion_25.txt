Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it incorrectly uses `ref[1]` twice instead of `ref[2]`, which could lead to unexpected results when the second argument is not intended to be duplicated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[0], ref[2])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `ref[0]` instead of `ref[1]`, which may cause the first argument to be passed twice, potentially altering the intended behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return pull(read, ref[0], ref[1], null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` as the third argument instead of `ref[2]`, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior when the function expects a valid argument.

DONE.
