  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("" + err));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise with a new error object, instead of resolving it with the value of the first resolved promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(promises[index]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise with the value of the first resolved promise, instead of rejecting it with the error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.notify({index: index, value: promises[index]});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would notify the promise with the value of the first resolved promise, instead of rejecting it with the error object.

DONE.
