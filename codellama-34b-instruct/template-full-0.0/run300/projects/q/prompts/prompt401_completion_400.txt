  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with the `this` context bound to the first argument, which in this case is `this`. This means that the new function will always be called with `this` set to the promise, regardless of how it is called. In the original code, `this` is not always the promise, it depends on how the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` calls the function with the `this` context set to `null`. This means that the function will always be called with `this` set to `null`, regardless of how it is called. In the original code, `this` is not always `null`, it depends on how the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then.apply(undefined)
```
This would result
