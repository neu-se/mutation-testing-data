  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].current.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed `id`, but this code pushes `a`, which is a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed `id` to `result[country].all`, but this code pushes `id` to `result[country].current`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all.push(a);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code pushed `id`, but this code pushes `a`, which is a different value.

DONE.
