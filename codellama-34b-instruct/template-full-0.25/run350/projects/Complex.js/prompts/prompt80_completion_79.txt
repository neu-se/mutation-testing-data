  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` is used instead of the addition operator `+`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator `-` is used instead of the addition operator `+`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator `/` is used instead of the addition operator `+`.

DONE.
