  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with the fulfillment value instead of being resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(deferred)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is called on the `Q` object instead of the `deferred` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` property of the `deferred` object is a promise that is resolved with the fulfillment value instead of the `deferred` object itself.

DONE.
