  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === false ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === true ? null : err
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `err` is `true`, while this new code fragment checks if `err` is `true` and returns `null` if it is.

DONE.
