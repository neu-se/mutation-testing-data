  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' && this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method would be called on the read stream even if the error code is not `ENOENT`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method would not be called on the read stream if the error code is not `ENOENT`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT' && this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method would be called on the read stream if the error code is not `ENOENT`.

DONE.
