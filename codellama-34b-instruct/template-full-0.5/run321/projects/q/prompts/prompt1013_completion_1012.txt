  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` would add the argument to the beginning of the `nodeArgs` array, rather than the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` would remove the last argument from the `nodeArgs` array, rather than adding a new one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` would remove the first argument from the `nodeArgs` array, rather than adding a new one.

DONE.
