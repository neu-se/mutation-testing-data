  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track unhandled rejections differently than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the length of the array of reported unhandled rejections differently than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would track the length of the array of unhandled reasons differently than the original code.

DONE.
