  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `array_slice` method, which returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, whereas the replacement code fragment is using a hardcoded array `[1, 2]`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using a variable `object.property` to access an object property, whereas the replacement code fragment is using a string `"foo"`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when(object.property)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `when` method to handle a rejected promise, whereas the replacement code fragment is using the `when` method to handle a resolved promise.

DONE.
