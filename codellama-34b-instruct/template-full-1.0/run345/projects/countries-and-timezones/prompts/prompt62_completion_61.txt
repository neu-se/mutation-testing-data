  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
10*id
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is called with `10*id`, which would result in a different set of data being passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is called with `id-1`, which would result in a different set of data being passed to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
id+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is called with `id+1`, which would result in a different set of data being passed to the function.

DONE.
