  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would cause the returned promise to be rejected, even if the input promise was fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and would throw an error when called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is not a function and would throw an error when called.

DONE.
