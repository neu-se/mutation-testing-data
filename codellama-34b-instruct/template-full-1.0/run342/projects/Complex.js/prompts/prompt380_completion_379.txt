  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + b` has a different value than `b` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + b` has a different value than `b` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because `b - a` has a different value than `b` in the original code.

DONE.
