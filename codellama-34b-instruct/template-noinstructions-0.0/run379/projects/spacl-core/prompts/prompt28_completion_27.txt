  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `true`, which means that the path must end with a slash, but the new code fragment is `false`, which means that the path can end with any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!string.endsWith('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `string.endsWith('/')`, which means that the path must end with a slash, but the new code fragment is `!string.endsWith('/')`, which means that the path cannot end with a slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
string.endsWith('$')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `string.endsWith('/')`, which means that the path must end with a slash, but the new code fragment is `string.endsWith('$')`, which means that the path must end with a dollar sign.

DONE.
