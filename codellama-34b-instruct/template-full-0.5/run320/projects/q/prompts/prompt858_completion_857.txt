  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would not be able to clear the timeout, as the `timeoutId` variable is now set to 0. This would cause the timeout to never be cleared, and the `deferred.reject` function to never be called, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would not be able to clear the timeout, as the `timeoutId` variable is now set to `null`. This would cause the timeout to never be cleared, and the `deferred.reject` function to never be called, resulting in a different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clearTimeout` function would not be able to clear the timeout, as the `timeoutId` variable is now set to `undefined`. This would cause the timeout to never be cleared
