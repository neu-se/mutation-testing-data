  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the statement `if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {` always evaluate to `true`, even if `otherOp.retain` is `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain ? otherOp.retain : 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the statement `if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {` always evaluate to `true`, even if `otherOp.retain` is `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp[)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the statement `if (<PLACEHOLDER>) {` always evaluate to `true`, even if `otherOp.retain` is `null`.

DONE.
