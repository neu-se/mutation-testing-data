  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-cosh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh()` function is being negated, which would result in a different return value for the same input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is being added to the `cosh()` function, which would result in a different return value for the same input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a^2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is being squared, which would result in a different return value for the same input.

DONE.
