  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.next()` would return a new object from the next step in the iterator, whereas `continuer` by itself would return the current object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.throw()
```
This would result in different behavior because `continuer.throw()` would throw an unhandled exception, whereas `continuer` by itself would not throw any exceptions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would cause an error when the `continuer` function is called, whereas `continuer` by itself would not produce an error.

DONE.
