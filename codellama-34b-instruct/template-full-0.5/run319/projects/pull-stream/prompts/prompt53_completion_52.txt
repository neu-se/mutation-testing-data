  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s != null
```
This would result in different behavior because `s != null` is always true when `s` is an object, whereas the original code fragment `s && typeof s === 'object'` checks if `s` is an object and is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `s !== null` checks if `s` is not null and not undefined, whereas the original code fragment `s && typeof s === 'object'` checks if `s` is an object and is not null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s === 'object' && s !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof s === 'object' && s !== null` checks if `s` is an object and is not null, whereas the original code fragment `s && typeof s === 'object'` checks if `s` is an object and is not null, but does not check if `
