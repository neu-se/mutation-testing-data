Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create(null)` creates an object with no prototype, which means it won't inherit any methods or properties from `Promise.prototype`, leading to potential errors when trying to call promise methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because using `Promise` instead of `Promise.prototype` would refer to the Promise constructor itself, not the prototype, which would cause issues when trying to access instance methods that are defined on the prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.prototype.constructor` refers to the constructor function of the Promise, which is not the same as the prototype object itself, potentially leading to incorrect behavior when trying to use promise methods.

DONE.
