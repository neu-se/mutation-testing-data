  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__esModule"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `amd` property, while the new code fragment is checking if the `define` function is defined and if it has an `esModule` property.

DONE.
