 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.stack` check in `makeStackTraceLong` would throw a TypeError, since `null` does not have a `stack` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.stack` check in `makeStackTraceLong` would throw a TypeError, since `{}` does not have a `stack` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.stack` check in `makeStackTraceLong` would throw a TypeError, since `function(){}` does not have a `stack` property.

DONE.
