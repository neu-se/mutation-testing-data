  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.defineProperty(Complex, "__esModule", { 'value': true });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` object would not have the `__esModule` property defined, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = true;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` object would have the `__esModule` property defined as `true`, which would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['__esModule'] = false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Complex` object would have the `__esModule` property defined as `false`, which would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
