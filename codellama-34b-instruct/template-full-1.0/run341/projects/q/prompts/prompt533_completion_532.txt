  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
return spread(value, fulfilled, new Object());
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `spread()` would be an object instead of a function, which would cause `spread()` to return a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
return spread(value, fulfilled, Promise.reject());
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `spread()` would be a rejected promise, which would cause `spread()` to return a rejected promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...
return spread(value, fulfilled, function() { throw new Error('something'); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `spread()` would be a function that throws an error, which would cause `spread()` to return a rejected promise.

DONE.
