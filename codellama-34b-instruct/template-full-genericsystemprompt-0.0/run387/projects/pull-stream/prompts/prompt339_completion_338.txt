  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is now being incremented by 1, which would cause the `seen` object to be updated with a different key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is now being multiplied by 2, which would cause the `seen` object to be updated with a different key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `field` variable is now being replaced with its length, which would cause the `seen` object to be updated with a different key.

DONE.
