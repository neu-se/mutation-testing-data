 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isFinite()` function would return `false`, causing the function to return an incorrect line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `DivideByZeroError`, causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined`, and ultimately causing the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Date()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a `Date` object, causing the `Number.isInteger()` function to return `false`, and ultimately causing the `getFileNameAndLineNumber` function to return `undefined`, and the `isInternalFrame` function to return `false`.

DONE.
