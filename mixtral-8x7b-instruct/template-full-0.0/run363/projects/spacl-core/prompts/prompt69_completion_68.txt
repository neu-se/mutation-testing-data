 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule['query']
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `query` method using bracket notation instead of dot notation, which can lead to issues if the `query` property is not defined or is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.query(path, verb, ctx || {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the behavior of the optional `ctx` parameter by providing an empty object as the default value instead of `undefined`. This can lead to unexpected results if the `rule.query` method relies on the `ctx` parameter being `undefined` in certain cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.deny(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `deny` method instead of the `query` method. This can lead to incorrect access control decisions if the `rule` object does not have a `deny`
