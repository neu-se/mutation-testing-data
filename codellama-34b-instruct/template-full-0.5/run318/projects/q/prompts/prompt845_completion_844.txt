  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, ms
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0, ms
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout would be different.

DONE.
