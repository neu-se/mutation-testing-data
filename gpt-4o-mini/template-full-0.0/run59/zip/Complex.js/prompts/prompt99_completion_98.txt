Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds the number to the nearest integer, while `parseFloat` converts a string to a floating-point number, potentially losing decimal precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseInt(c)
```
This would result in different behavior because `parseInt` converts a string to an integer, discarding any decimal part, whereas `parseFloat` retains the decimal portion of the number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `c` by 2 changes its value, while `parseFloat` simply converts the string representation of `c` to a number without altering its value.

DONE.
