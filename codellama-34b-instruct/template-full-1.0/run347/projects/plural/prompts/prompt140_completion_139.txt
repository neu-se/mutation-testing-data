  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the first index of the rule array, which contains the original word, would be used instead of the correct index, which contains the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.match(rule[0])[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the capturing group of the regular expression, which is not expected by the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace(rule[0], '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the matched portion of the word, which is not expected by the rest of the code.

DONE.
