  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise with an error, rather than rejecting it, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so `deferred.reject` would throw an error, rather than being called with an error argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty function would be called with an error argument, rather than `deferred.reject` being called with an error argument.

DONE.
