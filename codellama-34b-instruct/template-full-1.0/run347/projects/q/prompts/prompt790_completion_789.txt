  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` as the second argument to `then` would cause the promise to be rejected with a `TypeError`, rather than settling with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` as the second argument to `then` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `undefined`, rather than settling with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `true` as the second argument to `then` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value `true`, rather than settling with the value `null`.

DONE.
