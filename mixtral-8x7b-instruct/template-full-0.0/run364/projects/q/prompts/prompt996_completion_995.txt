 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is expected to be a function, and replacing it with `null` would cause an error when it is invoked in `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that is used to resolve the deferred object, while `deferred.resolve` is a method that directly resolves the deferred object. Replacing `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` with `deferred.resolve` would cause the promise to be immediately resolved with `undefined` as the value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` returns a function that is used to resolve the deferred object, while
