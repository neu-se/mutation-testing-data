  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path + '*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of the `*` character would cause the regular expression to match any character zero or more times, rather than matching the character `path` exactly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test to fail if the length of the `path` string is not the same as the length of the `spec` string, even if the two strings have the same characters in the same order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the test to fail if the first character of the `path` string is not the same as the first character of the `spec` string, even if the rest of the two strings match.

DONE.
