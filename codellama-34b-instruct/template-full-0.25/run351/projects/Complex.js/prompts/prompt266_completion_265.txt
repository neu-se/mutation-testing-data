  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a, b
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the sum of the two arguments, rather than the original behavior of returning the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the product of the two arguments, rather than the original behavior of returning the difference.

DONE.
