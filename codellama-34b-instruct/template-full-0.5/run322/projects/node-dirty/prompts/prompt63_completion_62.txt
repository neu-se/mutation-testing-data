  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because `end()` is a method that closes the write stream, whereas `this._writeStream` is an object that represents the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because `close()` is a method that closes the write stream, whereas `this._writeStream` is an object that represents the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because `destroy()` is a method that destroys the write stream, whereas `this._writeStream` is an object that represents the write stream.

DONE.
