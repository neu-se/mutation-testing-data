  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of `progressed` instead of the original value of `promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(progressed, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of `progressed` instead of the original value of `promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise.then(void 0, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the value of `void 0` instead of the original value of `promise`.

DONE.
