  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match an additional trailing slash, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more characters that are not slashes, whereas the original code matches one or more characters that are not slashes or colons.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/([^/:]+)'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match one or more characters that are not slashes or colons, whereas the original code matches one or more characters that are not slashes.

DONE.
