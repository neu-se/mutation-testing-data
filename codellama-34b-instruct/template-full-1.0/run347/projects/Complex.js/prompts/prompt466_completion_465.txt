  Option 1: The `b === 0` can be replaced with: `b === 1`. This would result in different behavior because the function would always return 0 instead of the correct value.

Option 2: The `b === 0` can be replaced with: `b !== 0`. This would result in different behavior because the function would always return Infinity instead of the correct value.

Option 3: The `b === 0` can be replaced with: `b < 0`. This would result in different behavior because the function would always return -Infinity instead of the correct value.

DONE.
