  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point1Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sine of the latitude of the first point, which is not related to the calculation of the great-circle distance between the two points.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(point2Rad)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the cosine of the latitude of the second point, which is not related to the calculation of the great-circle distance between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(deg2rad(point1.latitude))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the cosine of the latitude of the first point, which is not related to the calculation of the great-circle distance between the two points.

DONE.
