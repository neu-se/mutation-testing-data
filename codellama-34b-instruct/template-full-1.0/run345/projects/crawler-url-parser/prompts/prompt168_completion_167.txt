  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` is a method that searches for a specific value within a string, while `includes` is a method that checks if a string contains a specific value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.indexOf(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the search value, while `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the search value is present in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.substring(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substring` returns a new string that is a subset of the original string, starting at the specified position and continuing to the end of the string, while `includes` checks if the search value is present in the string.

DONE.
