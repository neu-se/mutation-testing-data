  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let rule
```
This would result in different behavior because `let` is a block-scoped variable declaration, whereas `const` is not. This means that the variable `rule` would be redeclared in each iteration of the loop, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var rule
```
This would result in different behavior because `var` is a function-scoped variable declaration, whereas `const` is block-scoped. This means that the variable `rule` would be redeclared in each iteration of the loop, causing the loop to never terminate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the variable `rule` to `null` in each iteration of the loop, causing the loop to never terminate.

DONE.
