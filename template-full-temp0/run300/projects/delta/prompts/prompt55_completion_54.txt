  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(ops)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array, but `ops` is an object with an `ops` property that is an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `ops.ops.length` checks if the `ops` property of the `ops` object is an array with a length greater than 0, but `Array.isArray` checks if the argument is an array regardless of its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ops === 'object' && ops.ops.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof ops === 'object'` checks if `ops` is an object, and `ops.ops.length > 0` checks if the `ops` property of the `ops` object is an array with a length
