  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined in the scope of the fragment, whereas `b` is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator negates the value of `a`, whereas the original code fragment simply returned the value of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(z ** 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z ** 2` operation would be applied to the value of `z`, whereas the original code fragment simply returned `z`.

DONE.
