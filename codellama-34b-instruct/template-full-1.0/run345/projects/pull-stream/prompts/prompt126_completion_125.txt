  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong value if the input parameter `max` is less than or equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong value if the input parameter `max` is less than the current value of `i`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= max
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to return the wrong value if the input parameter `max` is greater than the current value of `i`.

DONE.
