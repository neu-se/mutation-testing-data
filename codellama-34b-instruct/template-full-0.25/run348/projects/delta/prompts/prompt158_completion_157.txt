  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the length of the next operation in the other iterator, rather than the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the length of the next operation in the this iterator, rather than the type of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to always return the type of the next operation in the other iterator, plus one.

DONE.
