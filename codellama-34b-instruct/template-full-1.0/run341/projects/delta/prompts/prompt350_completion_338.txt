  DONE.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `invert` method always delete the entire contents of the `Delta`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `invert` method always retain one more character than the input, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `invert` method always subtract one from the attributes of the input, which would result in a different output.

Overall, these code modifications would change the behavior of the `invert` method and could potentially break the application.
