  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport, reportedUnhandledRejections.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice` method would remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
