  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first element of the `ref` array, regardless of the length of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last element of the `ref` array, regardless of the length of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[Math.floor(Math.random() * ref.length)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random element from the `ref` array, rather than always returning the same element.

DONE.
