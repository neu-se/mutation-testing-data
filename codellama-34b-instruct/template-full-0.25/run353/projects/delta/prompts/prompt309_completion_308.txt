  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length()` would return the length of the line, which may be different from the number of characters in the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length - 1` would return the length of the line minus one, which may be different from the number of characters in the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length + 1` would return the length of the line plus one, which may be different from the number of characters in the line.

DONE.
