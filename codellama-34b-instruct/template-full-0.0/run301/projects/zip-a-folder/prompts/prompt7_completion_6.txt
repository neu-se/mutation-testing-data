  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `targetFilePath` string to uppercase, which could cause the code to write to a different file than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.substring(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring()` method would return a substring of the `targetFilePath` string starting from the second character, which could cause the code to write to a different file than intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `targetFilePath` string into an array of substrings using the `/` character as a delimiter, and the `pop()` method would return the last element of the array, which could cause the code to write to a different file than intended.

DONE.
