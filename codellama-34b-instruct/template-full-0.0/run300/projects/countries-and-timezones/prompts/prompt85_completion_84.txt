  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of the `deprecated` property of the `options` object, regardless of whether it is `true` or `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.deprecated ? options.deprecated : options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the `deprecated` property of the `options` object if it is `true`, and the `options` object itself if it is `false`.

DONE.
