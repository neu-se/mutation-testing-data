  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `object` is a promise that is passed to `Q.dispatch`, but if `null` is used instead, it will cause a `TypeError` because `null` is not a valid promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` expects a promise to be passed to it, and if `void 0` is used instead, it will cause a `TypeError` because `void 0` is not a valid promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`hello`
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.dispatch` expects a promise to be passed to it, and if a string literal is used instead, it will cause a `TypeError` because a string is not a valid promise.

DONE.
