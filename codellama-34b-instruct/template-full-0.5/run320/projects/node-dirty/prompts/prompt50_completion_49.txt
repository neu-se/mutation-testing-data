  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the key plus 1, whereas the original code would return the value of the key as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the key multiplied by 2, whereas the original code would return the value of the key as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(key) + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value of the key plus a random number, whereas the original code would return the value of the key as is.

DONE.
