  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...(prev, [key]: tzs[key]);
```
This would result in incorrect behavior because the `Object.assign` function expects two arguments, the target object and the source object, but in this case, only one argument is being passed, which would cause the function to return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...(prev, Object.keys(tzs[key])[0]: tzs[key]));
```
This would result in incorrect behavior because the `Object.keys` function returns an array of keys for an object, but in this case, we're trying to use it as a key itself, which would cause the code to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...(prev, {[key]: tzs[key]}));
```
This would result in correct behavior because it ensures that the `Object.assign` function is passed two arguments, the target object and the source object, which is necessary for the function
