  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof fileNameAndLineNumber
```
This would result in different behavior because `typeof` returns a string indicating the type of the operand, and since `fileNameAndLineNumber` is a variable, it would return "undefined" if it has not been initialized. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false`, even if the promise was rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Object.keys(fileNameAndLineNumber).length
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of all the keys in an object, and the `length` property of an array indicates the number of elements in the array. This means that if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` object has no keys, the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` regardless of whether the promise was resolved or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks whether the `fileNameAndLine
