  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the second string in the `strings` array instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].length
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the length of the first string in the `strings` array instead of the string itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be comparing the lowercase version of the first string in the `strings` array instead of the original string.

DONE.
