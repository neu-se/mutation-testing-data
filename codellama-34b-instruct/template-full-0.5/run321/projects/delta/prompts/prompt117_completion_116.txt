  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `elem` object has a `delete` property, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `elem` object has a `retain` property, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `elem` object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
