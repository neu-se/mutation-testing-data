  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `!` operator to negate the result of the `includes` method, while this replacement code fragment does not negate the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `includes` method, which checks if the `text` parameter is a substring of the `tmpUrl.text` property, while this replacement code fragment uses the `indexOf` method, which checks if the `text` parameter is a substring of the `tmpUrl.text` property and returns its index if it is, or -1 if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `includes` method, which checks if the `text
