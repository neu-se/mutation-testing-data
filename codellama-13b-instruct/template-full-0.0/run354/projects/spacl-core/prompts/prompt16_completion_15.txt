  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a slash, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that contains at least one slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a slash, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that contains at least one slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment matches any string that ends with a slash, while the buggy code fragment matches any string that contains at least one slash.

DONE.
