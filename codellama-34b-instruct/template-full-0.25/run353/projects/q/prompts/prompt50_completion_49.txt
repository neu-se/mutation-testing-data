  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even when `flushing` is `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!flushing && true
```
This would result in different behavior because `!flushing && true` is always falsy, so the `if` statement would never be executed, even when `flushing` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing || false
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing || false` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even when `flushing` is `false`.

DONE.
