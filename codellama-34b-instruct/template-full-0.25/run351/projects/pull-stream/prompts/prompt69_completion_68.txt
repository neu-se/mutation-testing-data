  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr` is an `Error` object, and `doneLackingErr.message` is a string that contains the error message. In the original code, `doneLackingErr` is passed as an argument to `console.warn()`, which expects a string. By replacing `doneLackingErr` with `doneLackingErr.message`, we are passing a string to `console.warn()`, which may result in a different warning message being displayed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
doneLackingErr.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because `doneLackingErr.stack` is a string that contains the stack trace of the error, whereas `doneLackingErr` is an `Error` object. By replacing `doneLackingErr` with `doneLackingErr.stack`, we are passing a string to `console.warn()`, which may result in a different warning message being
