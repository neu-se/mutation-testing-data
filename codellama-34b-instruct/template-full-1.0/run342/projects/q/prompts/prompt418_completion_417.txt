  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns the state of the promise as a string, and the comparison would always return `false`, even if the promise had been rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns the state of the promise as a string, and the comparison would always return `false`, even if the promise was pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.state !== "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method returns the state of the promise as a string, and the comparison would always return `true`, even if the promise was fulfilled.

DONE.
