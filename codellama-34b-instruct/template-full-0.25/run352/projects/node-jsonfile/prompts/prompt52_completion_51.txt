  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj + {}` would return a new object, whereas `obj` would return the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` would return a string representation of the object, whereas `obj` would return the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj[Symbol.iterator]()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj[Symbol.iterator]()` would return an iterator for the object, whereas `obj` would return the original object.

DONE.
