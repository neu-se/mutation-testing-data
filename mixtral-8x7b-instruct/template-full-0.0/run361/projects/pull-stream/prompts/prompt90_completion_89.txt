 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function might expect the `data` argument, but instead receives a boolean value `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because if `test` is falsy, the original code would throw an error, but this modification would not call `test` and continue executing the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
window.test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a local `test` variable, while this modification refers to the global `window.test` object, which might have different behavior.

DONE.
