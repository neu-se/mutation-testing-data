  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value, regardless of the actual type of the embed, leading to incorrect behavior in the code that follows.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than `embedType`, leading to different behavior in the code that follows.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than `embedType`, leading to different behavior in the code that follows.

DONE.
