  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` is a method of the `Function` prototype and would always be a string, causing the condition to always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply !== callback.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is a property of functions that contains the number of arguments expected by the function. If the `length` property is different from the `apply` method, the condition would always evaluate to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.prototype !== callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `prototype` is a property of functions that contains a reference to the function's prototype object. If the `prototype` property is not the same as the function itself, the condition would always evaluate to `true`.

DONE.
