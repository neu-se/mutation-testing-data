  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always advance the iterator by one step, even if the current operation is not a retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of characters retained in the current operation, which may not be the same as the number of characters in the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(otherOp.retain || 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would advance the iterator by the number of characters retained in the current operation, or by one step if the current operation is not a retain operation.

DONE.
