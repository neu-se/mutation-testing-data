  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode !== 300
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a different status code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode < 200
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a status code that is less than 200, which is not the same as checking for a status code that is not equal to 200.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res.statusCode === 404
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for a status code that indicates the requested resource could not be found, which is not the same as checking for a status code that is not equal to 200.

DONE.
