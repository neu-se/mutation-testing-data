  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.insert` is a different value than `elem`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.delete` is a different value than `elem`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `elem.retain` is a different value than `elem`, which could cause the `if` statement to evaluate to a different result.

DONE.
