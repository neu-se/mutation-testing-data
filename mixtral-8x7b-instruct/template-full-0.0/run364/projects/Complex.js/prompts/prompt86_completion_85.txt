 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always consider the next token as a part of the complex number, even if it is a whitespace character or not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
tokens[i + 1] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any token (including whitespace characters) to be considered as a part of the complex number, potentially causing unexpected parsing results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!isNaN(parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]))
