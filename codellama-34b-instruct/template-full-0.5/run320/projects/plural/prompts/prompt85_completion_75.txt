  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, but this code fragment would replace an existing rule with the same pattern, resulting in the same output for both "mouse" and "mice".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouse'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, but this code fragment would replace an existing rule with a different pattern, resulting in a different output for "mice" and "mouse".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice', 'mouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds a new rule to the pluralization function, but this code fragment would replace an existing rule with a different pattern, resulting in a different output for "mice" and "mouse".

DONE.
