  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name]();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was calling the method on the object, while the replaced code is calling the method without passing the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value[name](args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not passing any arguments to the method, while the replaced code is passing an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(value[name](args));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was not returning a promise, while the replaced code is returning a promise that resolves with the value returned by the method call.

DONE.
