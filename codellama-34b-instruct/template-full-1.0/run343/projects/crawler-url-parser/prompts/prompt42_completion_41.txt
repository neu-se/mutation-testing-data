  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'https:/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `http://` as the default protocol for relative URLs, while the mutated code uses `https://`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the URL being parsed is a relative URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http:/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `http://` as the default protocol for relative URLs, while the mutated code uses `http:/`. This could cause the code to behave differently if the URL being parsed is a relative URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace(/^/g, 'www.')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not prepend `www.` to the URL
