  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `a` is equal to 0. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if `b` is not equal to 0. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== 0 && b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `b` is equal to 0, while this new code fragment checks if both `a` and `b` are not equal to 0. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
