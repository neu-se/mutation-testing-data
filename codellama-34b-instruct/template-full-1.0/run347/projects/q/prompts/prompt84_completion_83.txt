  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
requestFlush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `requestFlush()` is a different function from `requestTick()`. `requestFlush()` is not defined in the provided code, so it would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value from `requestTick()`. `undefined` is not a function, so it would not cause an error, but it would also not call the `requestTick()` function as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("hello!")
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log()` is a different function from `requestTick()`. `console.log()` is not related to the ticking functionality, so it would not cause an error, but it would also not have the intended effect of requesting a tick.
