  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `Q` function to `runSingle` rather than the `domain` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `Promise` constructor to `runSingle` rather than the `domain` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
local
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `local` variable to `runSingle` rather than the `domain` function.

DONE.
