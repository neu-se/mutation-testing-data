  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `array_map` returns a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array.

DONE.
