  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Hello, world!");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to throw an error, which would be different from the original behavior of running the task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = noop;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to run the noop function instead of the original task, which would have different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
task = function() { throw new Error("Hello, world!"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the program to run a function that throws an error, which would be different from the original behavior of running the task.

DONE.
