  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` would return the next op in the iterator, while `thisIter.next` would return a reference to the `next` method itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` would return the next op in the `other` iterator, while `thisIter.next` would return a reference to the `next` method of the `this` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next(length)` would return the next `length` ops in the `other` iterator, while `thisIter.next` would return a reference to the `next` method of the `this` iterator.

DONE.
