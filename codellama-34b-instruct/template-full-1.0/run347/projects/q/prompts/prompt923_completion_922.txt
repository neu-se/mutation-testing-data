  Option 1:
```
var arr = [];
for (let i = 0; i > (x, x = arr[i]); i++) {
    arr.push(i);
    arr[i] = arr[i] + 1;
}

```
This would result in infinite loop in the `for` loop because the condition `i === arr[1]-1` is never met since `arr[i] = arr[i] + 1` changes the value of `arr` and `x` is never updated inside the loop.

Option 2:
```
let x = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (x === arr[1]-1) break;
    arr.push(i);
    arr[i] = arr[i] + 1;
}
```
This would result in the loop iterating forever because `x` is never assigned a value, so `x === arr[1]-1` is always false.

Option 3:
```
let x = 0;
