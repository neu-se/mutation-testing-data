 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a negative character set (`[^/]`) which is replaced with a positive character set, allowing any character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]{1,100}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows any number of characters, while this replacement limits the length to 1-100 characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]{1,}$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment allows any number of characters, while this replacement requires at least one character.

DONE.
