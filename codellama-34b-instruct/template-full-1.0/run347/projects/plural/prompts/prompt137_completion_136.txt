  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[2]` is the third element of the `rules` array, which is a function that takes a word and a regular expression as arguments and returns a modified word. In contrast, `rule[1]` is a string that contains the plural form of a word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toLowerCase()` would convert the plural form of the word to lowercase, which is not the same as the original behavior of returning the plural form of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1].substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr(1)` would return the substring of the plural form of the word starting from the second character, which is not the same as the original behavior of returning the plural form of the word.

DONE.
