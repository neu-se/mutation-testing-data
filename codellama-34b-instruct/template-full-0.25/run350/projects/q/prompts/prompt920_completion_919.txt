  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected with a different reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method would be called with a different argument, which would cause the promise to be notified with a different value.

DONE.
