Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.props
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null` from the `query` method, regardless of the input parameters. The original code checks if the `ctx` parameter is provided and matches the `match` variable with the `props` of
