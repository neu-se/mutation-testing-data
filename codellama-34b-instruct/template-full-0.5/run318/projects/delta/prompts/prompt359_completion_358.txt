  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.length, priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the length of the `arg` object instead of the `arg` object itself, which could cause the method to behave differently if the length is used within the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg[0], priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first element of the `arg` array instead of the `arg` object itself, which could cause the method to behave differently if the first element is used within the method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arg.reverse(), priority
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the reversed version of the `arg` array instead of the original `arg` object, which could cause the method to behave differently if the reversed array is used within the method.

DONE.
