  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the callback with an error object as the first argument, while this replacement calls the callback with `null` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the callback with an error object as the first argument, while this replacement calls the callback with a different error object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment called the callback with an error object as the first argument, while this replacement calls the callback with `undefined` as the first argument.

DONE.
