  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function has a different definition than the `sinh` function. Specifically, `cosh` returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number, while `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine. Using `cosh` instead of `sinh` would result in a different value for the `Complex` object, causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is called with a different argument. Specifically, `sinh(a)` returns the hyperbolic sine of the real part of the complex number, while `sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of the imaginary part of the complex number. Using `sinh(a)` instead of `sinh` would result in a different value for the `Complex` object, causing the tests to fail.
