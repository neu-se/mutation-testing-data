  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) && value.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `value.inspect().state === "fulfilled"` would cause the `nearer` function to return the fulfillment value only if the promise is fulfilled, which would lead to different behavior in the `when` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) && value.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `value.inspect().state === "rejected"` would cause the `nearer` function to return the rejection reason only if the promise is rejected, which would lead to different behavior in the `when` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise(value) && value.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `value
