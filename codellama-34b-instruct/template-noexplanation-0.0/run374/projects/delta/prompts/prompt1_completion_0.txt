  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a == null
```
This change will cause the function to return an empty object when `a` is null or undefined, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `a` as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This change will cause the function to return an empty object when `a` is null, but not when it is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== null && a !== undefined
```
This change will cause the function to return an empty object when `a` is neither null nor undefined, which is different from the original behavior where it would return `a` as is.

DONE.
