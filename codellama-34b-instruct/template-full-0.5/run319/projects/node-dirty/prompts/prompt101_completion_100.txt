  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to be called on the `_data` object even if the `row.val` property is not undefined, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to be called on the `_data` object only if the `row.val` property is null, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
row.val === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `delete` method to be called on the `_data` object only if the `row.val` property is the string `'undefined'`, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
