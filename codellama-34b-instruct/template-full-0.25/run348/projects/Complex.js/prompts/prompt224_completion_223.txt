  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment only checks if `a` is greater than 0. This means that the new code fragment would not consider the case where `a` is equal to 0, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while the new code fragment checks if `a` is not equal to 0. This means that the new code fragment would consider the case where `a` is equal to 0, which could result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `a` is greater than or equal to 0, while the
