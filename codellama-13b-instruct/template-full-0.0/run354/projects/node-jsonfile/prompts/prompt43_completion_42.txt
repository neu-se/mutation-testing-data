  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toString()` method is called on the `obj` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is accessed on the `obj` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `constructor` property is accessed on the `obj` object, which could potentially cause a different behavior in the code.

DONE.
