  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"Hello World!"
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return a different value, even if the inputs are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would use a different value for the `timeout` parameter, even if the `timeout` value was not specified by the caller.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would use an undefined value for the `timeout` parameter, even if the `timeout` value was specified by the caller.

DONE.
