  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.pop();
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` removes the last element of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.shift();
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` removes the first element of the array, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arr.slice(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, whereas the original code fragment uses `pop(<PLACEHOLDER>)` which is a syntax error.

DONE.
