 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not receive an error object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application if the error is expected to be handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would receive an empty object instead of an error object, which could cause unexpected behavior in the application if the error is expected to be handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback function would not be called at all, which could cause the application to continue executing without handling the error, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or bugs.

DONE.
