  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with two arguments, while the original code only passes one argument. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with only one argument, while the original code passes two arguments. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let currentUrl = parse(href, baseUrlStr, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parse` function is called with three arguments, while the original code only passes two arguments. This could cause the function to return a different result, potentially leading to different behavior in the program.

DONE.
