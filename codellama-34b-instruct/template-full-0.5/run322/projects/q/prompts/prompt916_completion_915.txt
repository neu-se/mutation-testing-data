  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("This is a bug"));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a different error message than the original code, which would cause any tests that check for the specific error message to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code, which would cause any tests that check for the specific resolved value to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a different value than the original code, which would cause any tests that check for the specific resolved value to fail.

DONE.
