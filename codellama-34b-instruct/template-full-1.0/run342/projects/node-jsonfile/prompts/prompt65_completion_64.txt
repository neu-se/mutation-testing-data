  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new string starting from the second character of the input string, while `replace` returns a new string with the replaced substring.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.charAt(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `charAt(0)` returns the first character of the input string, while `replace` returns a new string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr(1)` returns the substring of the input string starting from the second character, while `replace` returns a new string with the replaced substring.

DONE.
