  I got you, please find below replacements for the PLACEHOLDER and the reasons for the replacement:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line `delta.push(otherIter.next())` pushes a new value to the delta array, but `otherIter.next()` does not. This means that the transformed data would not be inserted into the delta array, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line `delta.push(otherIter.next())` pushes a new value to the delta array, but `delta.retain` would retain the current value in the delta array, leading to incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Delta.prototype.push.call(otherIter.next())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original line `delta.push
