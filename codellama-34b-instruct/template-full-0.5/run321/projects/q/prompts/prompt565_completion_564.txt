  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would return `false` for `null`, causing the `reject` function to be called with `null` as its argument, which would result in a rejected promise with a value of `null`. This is different from the original behavior, where `reject` would be called with `exception` as its argument, which would result in a rejected promise with a value of `exception`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration` function would return `false` for `undefined`, causing the `reject` function to be called with `undefined` as its argument, which would result in a rejected promise with a value of `undefined`. This is different from the original behavior, where `reject` would be called with `exception` as its argument, which would result in a rejected promise with a value of `exception`.
