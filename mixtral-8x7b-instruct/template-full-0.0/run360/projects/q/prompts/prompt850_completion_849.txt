 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` condition would always evaluate to `true`, and the error object would always be replaced with a timeout error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 === typeof error
