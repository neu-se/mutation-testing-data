  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the length of the current op, while this code returns the length plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code returns the length of the current op, while this code returns the length minus one.

DONE.
