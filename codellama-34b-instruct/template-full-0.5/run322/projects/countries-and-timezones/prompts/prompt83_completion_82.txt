  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object instead of the country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getCountriesForTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of countries instead of a single country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezonesForCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of timezones instead of a single country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

DONE.
