  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, but the replaced code fragment always returns `false`, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with `cb` as its second argument, even if `abort` is not truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, but the replaced code fragment always returns `null`, which is a falsy value, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with `cb` as its second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `abort` is truthy, but the replaced code fragment always returns `undefined`, which is a falsy value, causing the `abortCb` function to be called with `cb` as
