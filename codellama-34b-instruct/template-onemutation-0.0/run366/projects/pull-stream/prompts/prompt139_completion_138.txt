  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. The `if` statement in the code would evaluate to `true` for `null`, which would cause the function to return `cb(null, generate())` instead of `cb(end, generate())`.

DONE.
