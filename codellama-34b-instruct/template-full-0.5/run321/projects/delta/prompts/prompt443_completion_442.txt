  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return the entire string, rather than a substring starting at the specified offset.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring that is one character shorter than the original substring.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method would return a substring that is one character longer than the original substring.

DONE.
