  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read.source
```
This would result in different behavior because `read.source` is a function that returns the source of the `read` stream, whereas `read` is a stream itself. By using `read.source`, the `pull` function would be returning the source of the `read` stream instead of the `read` stream itself, which could cause issues with the rest of the code that relies on the `read` stream.

DONE.
