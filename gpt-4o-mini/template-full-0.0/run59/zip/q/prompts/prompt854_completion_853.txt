Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `timeoutId` by adding 1, which is not a valid identifier for the `clearTimeout` function, leading to a potential failure to clear the timeout.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `clearTimeout` will not clear the timeout, potentially causing the promise to reject even after it has been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeoutId * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because multiplying `timeoutId` by 2 will also not reference the correct timeout ID, leading to an incorrect call to `clearTimeout`, which may leave the timeout active and cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
