  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` method is not defined in the `defer` object, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method is not defined in the `defer` object, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method is not defined in the `defer` object, and the code would throw a `ReferenceError` when trying to access it.

DONE.
