  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.fulfill
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be replaced with the `fulfill` method, which would result in the promise being resolved instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method would be replaced with the `resolve` method, which would result in the promise being resolved immediately instead of waiting for the `reject` method to be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because a new `notFulfilled` method would be introduced, which would not be a promise method. Therefore, it would cause an error.

DONE.
