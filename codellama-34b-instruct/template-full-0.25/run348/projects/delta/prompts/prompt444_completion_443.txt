  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables to calculate the number of characters to extract from the string, while this replacement code fragment uses the sum of `offset` and `length` to calculate the number of characters to extract, which could result in a different number of characters being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables to calculate the number of characters to extract from the string, while this replacement code fragment uses the difference between `length` and `offset` to calculate the number of characters to extract, which could result in a different number of characters being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset * length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `offset` and `length` variables to calculate the number of characters to extract from the string,
