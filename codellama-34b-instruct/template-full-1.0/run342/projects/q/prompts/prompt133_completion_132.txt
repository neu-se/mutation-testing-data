  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not an object, and would cause the `isObject` function to return `false` if the value is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and would cause the `isObject` function to return `false` if the value is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is not an object, and would cause the `isObject` function to return `false` if the value is not an object.

DONE.
