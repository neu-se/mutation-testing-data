  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus > minus
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `plus` is greater than `minus`, regardless of the value of `plus + minus`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `plus` and `minus` have different signs, regardless of the value of `plus + minus`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true when `plus` and `minus` have opposite signs, regardless of the value of `plus + minus`.

DONE.
