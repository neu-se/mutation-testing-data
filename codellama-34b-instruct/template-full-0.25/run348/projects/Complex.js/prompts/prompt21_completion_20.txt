  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the input, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.exp
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` returns the exponential of the input, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log` returns the natural logarithm of the input, whereas `Math.sqrt` returns the square root of the input.

DONE.
