  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `splice` method to remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `splice` method to remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `splice` method to remove the wrong element from the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

DONE.
