  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` property is now a hardcoded string, which may not match the intended policy name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + "x"
```
This would result in different behavior because the policy name is now modified to include the character "x", which may not be expected in the query.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the policy name is now a random number, which may not be a valid policy name in the context of the application.

DONE.
