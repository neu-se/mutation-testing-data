 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!thisOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, causing the code to continue if the current operation is a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.delete === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.delete` is undefined, which might not be the case, causing the condition to fail and the code to continue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisOp.hasOwnProperty('delete')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the 'delete' property exists in the 'thisOp' object, which might always be true, causing the condition to always evaluate to true and the code to continue.

DONE.
