  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string on every character, while this replacement splits it on forward slashes only.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string on every character, while this replacement splits it on forward slashes only, using a regular expression.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split(/\//g)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string on every character, while this replacement splits it on forward slashes only, using a regular expression with the global flag.

DONE.
