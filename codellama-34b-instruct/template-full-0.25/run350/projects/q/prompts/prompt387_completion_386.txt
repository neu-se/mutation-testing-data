  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, and `Q.fcall` expects a function as its first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value, and `Q.fcall` expects a function as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => value
```
This would result in different behavior because `() => value` is a function that returns `value`, whereas `value` is a primitive value.

DONE.
