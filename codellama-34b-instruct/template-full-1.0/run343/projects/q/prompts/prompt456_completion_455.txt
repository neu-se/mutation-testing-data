  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_includes
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_includes` checks if the given element is present in the array. In contrast, `array_indexOf` returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve(unhandledRejections)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` returns a resolved promise with the given value, whereas `array_indexOf` returns a number indicating the index of the element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the length of the `unhandledRejections` array, whereas `array_indexOf` returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array.

DONE.
