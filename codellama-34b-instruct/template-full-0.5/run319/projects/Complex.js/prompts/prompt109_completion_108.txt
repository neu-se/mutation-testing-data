  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator inverts the result of the `isNaN` function, so if the original code fragment would have returned `true`, the modified code fragment would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isFinite` function returns `true` if the number is a finite number, while the `isNaN` function returns `true` if the number is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function is a static method of the `Number` object that returns `true` if the number is not a number, while the `isNaN` function is a global function that returns `true` if the number is not a number and also coerces the argument to a number.
