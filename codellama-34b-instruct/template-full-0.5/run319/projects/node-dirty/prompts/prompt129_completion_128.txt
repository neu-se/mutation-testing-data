  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid argument for the `cork` method, and it would cause the code to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid argument for the `cork` method, but it would cause the code to behave differently than the original code fragment, which used `this._queue.size` as the argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork(this._queue.size + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to behave differently than the original code fragment, which used `this._queue.size` as the argument.

DONE.
