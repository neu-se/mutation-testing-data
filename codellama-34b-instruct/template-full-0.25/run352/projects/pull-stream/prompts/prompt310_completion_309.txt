  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `test` is truthy, regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the evaluation of the expression, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` if `test` is falsy, regardless of the value of `data`.

DONE.
