  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the PLACEHOLDER is now 2, which is different from the original value of 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable 'x' is now being used instead of the value 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
+1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the PLACEHOLDER is now positive 1, which is different from the original value of 1.

DONE.
