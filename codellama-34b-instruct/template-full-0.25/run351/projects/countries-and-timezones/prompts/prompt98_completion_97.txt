  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, whereas the `===` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `!==` operator would return `true` for any value that is not strictly equal to `true`, whereas the `===` operator would only return `true` for the value `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of the expression that follows it. In this case, the `!` operator would return `true` if `deprecated` is `false`, and `false` if `deprecated` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deprecated ? false : true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator is a ternary operator that evaluates to the first expression if the condition is `true
