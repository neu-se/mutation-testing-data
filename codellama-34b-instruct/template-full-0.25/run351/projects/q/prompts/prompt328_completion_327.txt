  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value - 1;
})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the `promise` object, which is not defined in the original code.

DONE.
