  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("keys", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of keys, rather than a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("values", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of values, rather than a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("entries", [])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise for an array of key-value pairs, rather than a promise for the keys of the eventually settled object.

DONE.
