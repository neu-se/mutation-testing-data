 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would immediately close the write stream, potentially causing data loss or errors in the `_flush` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.exit();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would terminate the entire Node.js process, which is not the intended behavior for closing the write stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._writeStream.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would close the write stream without destroying it, potentially causing issues with further writes or error handling.

DONE.
