  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the operand, while the `!==` operator checks for strict equality. In this case, the `resolver` variable is not a string, so the comparison would always return `false`, even if `resolver` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `function() {}` syntax creates a new function object, which would never be strictly equal to the `resolver` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolver !== Promise.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, and the `resolver` variable is not a function.

DONE.
