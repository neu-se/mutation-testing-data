  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.then` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value of the promise, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.catch
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.catch` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value of the promise, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.finally` is a method that returns a promise for the eventual value of the promise, whereas `this.all` is a method that returns a promise for an array of values.

DONE.
