  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the entire buffer, while this new code fragment only includes the buffer up to the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the buffer as-is, while this new code fragment converts the buffer to uppercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.replace('foo', 'bar')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes the buffer as-is, while this new code fragment replaces all occurrences of "foo" with "bar".

DONE.
