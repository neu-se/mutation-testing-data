Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.*\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it allows for an empty segment before the trailing slash, which would not be caught by the original regex that requires at least one character before the slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^.+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the requirement for a trailing slash altogether, allowing paths that do not end with a slash to be considered valid, contrary to the original specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it only allows a single slash as a valid path, rejecting any paths that contain additional characters, which is a significant change from the original regex that allows for more complex paths.

DONE.
