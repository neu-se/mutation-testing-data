  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method that retains the next `length` characters, whereas `push` is a method that appends an operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a method that inserts a string at the current position, whereas `push` is a method that appends an operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that deletes the next `length` characters, whereas `push` is a method that appends an operation to the delta.

DONE.
