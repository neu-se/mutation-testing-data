  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking whether the text was null, while this code fragment checks the length of the trimmed text.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the text as is, while this code fragment converts the text to lowercase before checking it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).parent().text().trim()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking the text of the current element, while this code fragment checks the text of the parent element.

DONE.
