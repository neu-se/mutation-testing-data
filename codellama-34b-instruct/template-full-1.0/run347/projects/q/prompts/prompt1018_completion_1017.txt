  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that is intended to be called, while `undefined` is not a function and will not produce any output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that is intended to be called when the promise is rejected, while `deferred.resolve` is a function that is intended to be called when the promise is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` is a function that is specific to the `deferred` object, while `Q.reject` is a function that is a part of the `Q` library.

DONE.
