 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.keys(<unknown as {}>)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force TypeScript to widen the `undefined` type to `unknown`, causing a type error when trying to call `Object.keys()` with an `unknown` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Object.values(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the values of the object instead of the keys, which would cause the `transform` function to behave incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(<any>Object).keys(attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses TypeScript's type checking, allowing the function to be called with a non-object value, which could cause unexpected behavior.

DONE.
