  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = Math.acos(r);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.acos()` function returns the inverse cosine of the argument, which is the angle in radians between the point and the equator, whereas the original code fragment `φ2` was the latitude of the point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = Math.asin(r);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.asin()` function returns the inverse sine of the argument, which is the angle in radians between the point and the equator, whereas the original code fragment `φ2` was the latitude of the point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const φ2 = Math.atan2(r, 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2()` function returns the arctangent of the ratio of the arguments, i.e. the
