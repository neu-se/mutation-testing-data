  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` property is not being initialized with an empty array, which could cause issues if the `current` property is accessed before it is initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: undefined, all: [] } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `current` property is being initialized with `undefined` instead of an empty array, which could cause issues if the `current` property is accessed before it is initialized.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result, { [country]: { current: [], all: undefined } }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` property is being initialized with `undefined` instead of an empty array, which could cause issues if the `all` property is accessed before it is initialized.

DONE.
