  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and adding the string `'foo'` to it would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and calling the `toUpperCase()` method on it would result in a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `file` is a string, and accessing its `length` property would result in a different value.

DONE.
