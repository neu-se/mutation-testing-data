  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes `null` instead. This could cause the callback to be executed with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes a new `Error` object instead. This could cause the callback to be executed with a different set of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (cb) cb(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passed the `err` argument to the callback, while this new code fragment passes `undefined` instead. This could cause the callback to be executed with a different set
