  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"values", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "keys" retrieves the keys of an object, while "values" retrieves the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"length", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "length" retrieves the length of an array, while "keys" and "values" retrieve the keys and values of an object, respectively.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"indexOf", []
```
This would result in different behavior because "indexOf" retrieves the index of a specific object in an array, while "keys" and "values" retrieve the keys and values of an object, respectively.

DONE.
