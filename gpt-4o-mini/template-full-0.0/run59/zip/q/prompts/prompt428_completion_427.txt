Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string "rejected" is a promise, which will always return false, leading to incorrect results when determining if an object is a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect().state
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the `state` property directly on the result of `inspect()`, which is not a promise, potentially causing an error if `object` is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the object is an instance of `Object`, which would incorrectly classify all objects as promises, leading to false positives for rejected promises.

DONE.
