  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b != 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 0, while this new code fragment checks for inequality with 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 0, while this new code fragment checks for equality with 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for equality with 0, while this new code fragment checks for greater than 0.

DONE.
