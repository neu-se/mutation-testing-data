  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.off` is a valid event listener function for the `close` event, but it would not actually close the write stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.emit` would emit the `error` event, but it would not actually stop the execution of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.end
```
This would result in different behavior because `output.end` would end the write stream without waiting for its callback to be called.

DONE.
