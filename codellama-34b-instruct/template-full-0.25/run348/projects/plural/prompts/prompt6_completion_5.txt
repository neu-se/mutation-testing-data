  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` expects an object as its argument, while `obj.toString()` returns a string representation of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` expects an object as its argument, while `obj.valueOf()` returns the primitive value of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call()` returns a string representation of the object's type, while `obj.constructor.name` returns the name of the object's constructor function.

DONE.
