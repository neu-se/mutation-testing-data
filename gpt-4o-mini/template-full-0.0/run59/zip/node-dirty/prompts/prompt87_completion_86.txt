Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer = buffer.slice(0, -1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character from the buffer instead of processing the last line, potentially leading to incomplete data being parsed and stored.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer = buffer.split('\n')[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the buffer to only the first line of the split array, discarding all other lines and causing only the first line to be processed, which may not represent the entire dataset.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer = '';
```
This would result in different behavior because it resets the buffer to an empty string immediately after appending the chunk, effectively losing all data from the current chunk and preventing any lines from being processed.

DONE.
