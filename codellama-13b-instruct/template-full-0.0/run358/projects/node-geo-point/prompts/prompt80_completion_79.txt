  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.PI` is a constant that represents the mathematical constant pi.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.E` is a constant that represents the base of the natural logarithm.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians, while `Math.sqrt(2)` is a constant that represents the square root of 2.

DONE.
