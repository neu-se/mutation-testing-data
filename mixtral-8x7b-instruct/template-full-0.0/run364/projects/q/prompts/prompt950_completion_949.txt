 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the global object, which may not be the same as the intended `thisp` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `this` context to the global object, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `this` context to the global object in non-strict mode, or to `undefined` in strict mode, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
