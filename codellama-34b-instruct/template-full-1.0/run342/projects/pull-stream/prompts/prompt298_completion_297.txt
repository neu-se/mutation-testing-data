  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return `null` as the data, even if there was no error, which would cause the `test` function to fail unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return an empty object as the data, even if there was no error, which would cause the `test` function to fail unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(new Error(), data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return an error, which would cause the `test` function to fail unexpectedly.

DONE.
