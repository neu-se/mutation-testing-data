  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err == false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if there is no error, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if there is an error, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `nextStream()` function to be called even if there is no error, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
