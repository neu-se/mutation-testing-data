  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different index, which could cause the iterator to skip over certain elements in the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different index, which could cause the iterator to return a different element in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method is called with a different index, which could cause the iterator to return the first element in the delta instead of the element at the specified index.

DONE.
