  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with the `abort` and `cb` arguments, instead of the `err` and `cb` arguments as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with `null` as the first argument, instead of `abort` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(abort, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `read` function with a different callback function as the second argument, instead of the `cb` function as in the original code.

DONE.
