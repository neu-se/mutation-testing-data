Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.invert` function to receive `null` instead of the actual attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling or errors during the inversion process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an empty object to `AttributeMap.invert`, which may not represent the intended attributes and could lead to unexpected results in the attribute transformation logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would default to an empty object if `op.attributes` is `undefined`, potentially masking issues where attributes are not set, leading to incorrect behavior in the inversion logic.

DONE.
