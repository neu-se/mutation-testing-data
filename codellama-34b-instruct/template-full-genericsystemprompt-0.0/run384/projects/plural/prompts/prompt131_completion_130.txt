  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].test(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` method is not a function of the `RegExp` object, and would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].exec(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exec` method returns an array of matches, and would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0].match(word)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method returns an array of matches, and would not be equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
