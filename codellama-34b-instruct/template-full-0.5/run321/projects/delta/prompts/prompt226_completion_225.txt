  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, as the condition is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once, as the condition is true only when the length is equal to zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute only if the length is not equal to zero, which is the opposite of the original condition.

DONE.
