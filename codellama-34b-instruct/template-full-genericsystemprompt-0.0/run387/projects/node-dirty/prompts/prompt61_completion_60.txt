  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to be destroyed with an error, which would trigger the error event handler in the `_load` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to be destroyed without an error, which would not trigger the error event handler in the `_load` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy(new Error('Intentional error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the read stream to be destroyed with an error, which would trigger the error event handler in the `_load` method.

DONE.
