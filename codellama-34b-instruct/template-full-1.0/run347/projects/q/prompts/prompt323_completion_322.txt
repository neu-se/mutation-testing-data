  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would receive `null` as the second argument, instead of the expected object with the `when` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would receive `undefined` as the second argument, which would cause an error when trying to call the `when` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.delay(promise, 1000)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promiseDispatch` method would receive a promise that would be resolved after 1 second, instead of the expected immediate resolution.

DONE.
