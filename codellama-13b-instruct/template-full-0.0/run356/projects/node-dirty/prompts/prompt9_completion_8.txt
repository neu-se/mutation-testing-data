  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val, key
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to set the same key twice, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val, key + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to set a different key than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, val, key - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be attempting to set a different key than the original code, which would cause the test to fail.

DONE.
