  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.directory` is a method that adds a directory to the archive. Using `zipArchive.file` would result in a different archive being created.

Using `zipArchive.directory(src, true)` would result in the directory being added recursively, which could result in a different archive being created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.directory(src, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.directory` takes two arguments: the first is
