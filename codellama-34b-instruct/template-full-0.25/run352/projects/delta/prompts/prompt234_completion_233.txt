  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and using `insert` instead of `push` would cause the `otherOp` to be inserted at the current position in the `delta` object, rather than being appended to the end of the `delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` and `push` are different methods in the `Delta` class, and using `retain` instead of `push` would cause the `otherOp` to be retained (i.e., not deleted) in the `delta` object, rather than being appended to the end of the `delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.delete(otherOp)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` and `push` are
