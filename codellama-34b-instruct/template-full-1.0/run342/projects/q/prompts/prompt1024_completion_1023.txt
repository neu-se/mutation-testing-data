  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```1```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder is a numeric value, and replacing it with another value would change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```nodeback(true)```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing `null` as the first argument, it would pass `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.noConflict()```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove any references to Q from the global scope and return the Q object.

DONE.
