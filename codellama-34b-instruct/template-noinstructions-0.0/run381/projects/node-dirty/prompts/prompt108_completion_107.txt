  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the buffer has a length of 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the buffer has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the buffer is empty, while this new code fragment checks if the buffer has a length that is not equal to 0.

DONE.
