  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const offset = Math.min(length, index - offset);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `offset` to 0, which would cause the while loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const offset = Math.max(length, index - offset);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `offset` to a value greater than the loop's upper limit, which would cause the loop to never execute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const offset = Math.floor(Math.random() * length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set `offset` to a random value between 0 and `length-1`, which would cause the loop to execute with a random number of iterations.

DONE.
