  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(10)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the next 10 elements in the iterator, rather than just the next one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move backward by 1 element, rather than forward.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(iter.peekLength() + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to move forward by the length of the next element, plus one more element, rather than just the next element.

DONE.
