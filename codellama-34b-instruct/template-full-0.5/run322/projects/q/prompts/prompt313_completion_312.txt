  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(Q.race);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `race` function is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(Q.join);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` function is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return <PLACEHOLDER>(Q.all);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `all` function is not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
