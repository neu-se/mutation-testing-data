 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would no longer be called with a truthy value, indicating that the stream has ended immediately with an error or unexpected condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called with a `null` value, which could indicate an error or unexpected condition, depending on how the callback is handled in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb()
```
This would result in different behavior because the callback would be called without any arguments, which could indicate an error or unexpected condition, depending on how the callback is handled in the rest of the code.

DONE.
