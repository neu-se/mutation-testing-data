  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of words, rather than an array of lines.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n", 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of at most 2 lines, rather than an array of all lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split(/\n/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would split the stack trace into an array of lines, but only if the line separators are newline characters, rather than any whitespace.

DONE.
