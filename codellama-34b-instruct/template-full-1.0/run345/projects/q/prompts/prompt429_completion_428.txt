  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.bind(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` is a method that takes no arguments, while `object.inspect.bind(reason)` is a method that takes an argument `reason`. This would cause the `reject` function to behave differently when it checks the state of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` returns a string representation of the promise, while `object.inspect.reverse()` would return the same string representation in reverse order. This would cause the `reject` function to behave differently when it checks the state of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because `object.inspect` returns a string representation of the promise, while `object.inspect.toUpperCase()` would
