  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would never be called, as the `ms` variable is always truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would be called with a different value, which could cause the promise to be rejected or resolved at a different time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ms - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` function would be called with a different value, which could cause the promise to be rejected or resolved at a different time.

DONE.
