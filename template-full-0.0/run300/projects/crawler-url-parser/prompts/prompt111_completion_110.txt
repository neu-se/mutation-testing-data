  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all occurrences of "http://" with "https://", which could potentially change the URL and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.split("://")[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method would split the URL into two parts, separated by the "://" delimiter, and return the second part, which could potentially change the URL and cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.substring(baseUrlStr.indexOf("://") + 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substring` method would return a substring of the URL starting from the position of the "://" delimiter, which could potentially change the URL and cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
