  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object
```
This would result in different behavior because `object` is a variable that refers to the object being nodeified, whereas `Q(object)` is a promise that resolves to the object. Using `object` directly would not create a promise and would not allow the `nodeback` function to be called with the appropriate arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(null, nodeback)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then(null, nodeback)` would create a promise that resolves to the object, but would not call the `nodeback` function with the appropriate arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function (value) {
    nodeback(null, value);
}, function (error) {
    nodeback(error);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).then(function (value) { nodeback(null
