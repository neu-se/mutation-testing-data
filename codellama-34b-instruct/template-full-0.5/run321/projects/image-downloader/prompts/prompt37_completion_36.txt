  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { flags: 'a' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flags` option is set to `'a'` instead of the default `'w'`. This would cause the file to be appended to instead of overwritten, which could lead to unexpected results if the file is not properly handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { encoding: 'utf16' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option is set to `'utf16'` instead of the default `'utf8'`. This could cause the file to be written with a different encoding, which could lead to issues if the file is not properly handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
createWriteStream(dest, { highWaterMark: 1024 })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `highWaterMark` option is set to `1024` instead of
