  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index].value
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `value` property of `this[index]` instead of `this[index]` itself, which could be a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the array instead of the current element, which could return a different value or throw an error if the index is out of bounds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `length` of the array to the `index` instead of accessing the element at that index, which could return a different value or throw an error if the index is out of bounds.

DONE.
