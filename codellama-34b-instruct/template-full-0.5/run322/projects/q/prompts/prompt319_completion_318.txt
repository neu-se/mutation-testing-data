  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function() {};
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` function would be overwritten with a new function that does nothing, which would cause the promise to resolve immediately without executing the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function() { throw new Error("Test error"); };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` function would be overwritten with a new function that throws an error, which would cause the promise to reject immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] = function() { return "Test value"; };
```
This would result in different behavior because the `descriptor[op]` function would be overwritten with a new function that returns a constant value, which would cause the promise to resolve immediately with that value.

DONE.
