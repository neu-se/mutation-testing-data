  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive a fulfilled promise instead of a rejected one, and would not propagate the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive `undefined` instead of a promise, and would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spread` method would receive `null` instead of a promise, and would likely throw an error.

DONE.
