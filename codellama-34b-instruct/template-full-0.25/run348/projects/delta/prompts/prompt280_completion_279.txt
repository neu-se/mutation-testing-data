  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a different object than `otherOp.retain`, and the `AttributeMap.invert` method would produce a different result when called with these two objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is a different object than `thisOp.retain`, and the `AttributeMap.invert` method would produce a different result when called with these two objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object, and the `AttributeMap.invert` method would throw an error when called with `null`.

DONE.
