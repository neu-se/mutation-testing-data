  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" ||
        process.toString() !== "[object process]" || !process.nextTick
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object, has a `toString` method that returns `"[object process]"`, and has a `nextTick` method. The modified code fragment checks if `process` is not an object, or has a `toString` method that returns something other than `"[object process]"`, or does not have a `nextTick` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof process !== "object" ||
        process.toString() !== "[object process]" || process.nextTick === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `process` is an object, has a `toString` method that returns `"[object process]"`, and has a `nextTick` method. The modified code fragment checks if `process` is not an object, or has a `toString` method that
