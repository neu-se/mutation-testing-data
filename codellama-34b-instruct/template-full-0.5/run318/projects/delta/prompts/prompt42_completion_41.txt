  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `String.fromCharCode` method to convert a character code to a string, while the replaced code would simply return the character code as a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `String.fromCharCode` method to convert a character code to a string, while the replaced code would return the string representation of the character code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.fromCharCode(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `String.fromCharCode` method to convert a character code to a string, while the replaced code would return the string representation of a different character code.

DONE.
