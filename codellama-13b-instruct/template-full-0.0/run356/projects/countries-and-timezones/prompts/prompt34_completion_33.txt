  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.ceil` function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.round` function returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.

DONE.
