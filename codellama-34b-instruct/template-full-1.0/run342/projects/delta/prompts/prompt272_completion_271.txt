  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the actual length of the current element, whereas `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is another element present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next element in the iterator, whereas `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is another element present.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the current element without moving the iterator position, whereas `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is another element present.

DONE.
