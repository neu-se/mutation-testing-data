  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next()` method advances the iterator to the next element, whereas the `hasNext()` method only checks if there is a next element without advancing the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next element in the iterator, whereas `hasNext()` only checks if there is a next element without returning its length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType()` returns the type of the next element in the iterator, whereas `hasNext()` only checks if there is a next element without returning its type.

DONE.
