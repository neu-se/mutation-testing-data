 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last two characters of the word instead of the correct number of characters before the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the last character of the word instead of the correct number of characters before the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * w.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number of characters from the word instead of the correct number of characters before the end of the word.

DONE.
