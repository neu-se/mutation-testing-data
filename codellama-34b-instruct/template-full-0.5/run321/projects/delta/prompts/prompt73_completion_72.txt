  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create an infinite loop, as the `push` method calls the `retain` method, which in turn calls the `push` method again, and so on.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the `push` method and directly modify the `ops` array, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(index, 0, newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the new operation at a specific position in the `ops` array, rather than appending it to the end of the array as the original code does.

DONE.
