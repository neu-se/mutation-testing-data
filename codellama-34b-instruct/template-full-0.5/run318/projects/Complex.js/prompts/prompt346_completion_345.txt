  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `a + b` is an expression that depends on the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `a - b` is an expression that depends on the values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a constant, while `a * b` is an expression that depends on the values of `a` and `b`.

DONE.
