 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks if the `data` is an empty array, which was not the case in the original code. The function would behave differently if the stream emits an empty array as data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks if the `data` is `null`, which was not the case in the original code. The function would behave differently if the stream emits `null` as data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks the return value of the `op` function, which was not the case in the original code. The function would behave differently if the `op` function returns a falsy value, causing the loop to break prematurely.

DONE.
