 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line in the original code would cause the resolved promise to contain the array of input promises, while resolving with `null` would cause the resolved promise to contain `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line in the original code would cause the resolved promise to contain the array of input promises, while resolving with an empty array would cause the resolved promise to contain an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line in the original code would cause the resolved promise to contain the array of input promises, while resolving with a fulfilled promise would cause the resolved promise to contain a promise instead of an array.
