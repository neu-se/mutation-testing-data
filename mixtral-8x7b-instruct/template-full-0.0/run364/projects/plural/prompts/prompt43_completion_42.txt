 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word instead of the last two characters, changing the pluralization rule for words like 'appendix'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -2, which would cause the function to add 'ices' to the end of the word regardless of its original form, breaking the pluralization rule for words like 'appendix'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * w.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a position in the word to remove, rather than consistently removing the last two characters. This would break the pluralization rule for words like 'appendix' and produce inconsistent results.

DONE.
