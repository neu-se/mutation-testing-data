  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one character further along in the string than it would be in the original code. This could potentially cause the `indexOf` method to return a different index, which could in turn cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const start = Op.length(thisOp) - iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `start` variable to be one character earlier in the string than it would be in the original code. This could potentially cause the `indexOf` method to return a different index, which could in turn cause the `eachLine` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
