  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options || {}
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `options` argument is mandatory, and the function would throw an error if it's not provided. However, by adding `options || {}`, the function would default to an empty object in case the `options` argument is not provided, which could lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options && { ...options, deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `deprecated` property is only added to the `options` object if it's explicitly set. By adding `...options` and setting `deprecated` to `true`, the function would always have a `deprecated` property set to `true`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

```
options && { ...options, countryId: '1234' }
```
This would result
