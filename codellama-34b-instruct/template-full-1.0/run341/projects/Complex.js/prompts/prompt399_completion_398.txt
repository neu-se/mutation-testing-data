  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['asin']
```
This would result in different behavior because `asin` and `acos` are inverse trigonometric functions with different ranges and properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['tan']
```
This would result in different behavior because `tan` and `acos` are related trigonometric functions with different ranges and properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['log']
```
This would result in different behavior because `log` and `acos` are unrelated mathematical functions with different properties and uses.

DONE.
