  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the attributes of `a` would be overwritten with the attributes of `b`, even if some of the attributes of `b` are null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b && a
```
This would result in different behavior because the attributes of `a` would only be overwritten with the attributes of `b` if `b` is not null and not undefined. If `b` is null or undefined, the attributes of `a` would remain unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b || a
```
This would result in different behavior because the attributes of `a` would only be overwritten with the attributes of `b` if `b` is null or undefined. If `b` is not null and not undefined, the attributes of `a` would remain unchanged.

DONE.
