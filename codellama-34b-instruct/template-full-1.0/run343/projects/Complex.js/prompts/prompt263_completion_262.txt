  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b / c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `a`, `b`, and `c` instead of the arctangent of `b` and `c`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b % c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and `c` instead of the arctangent of `b` and `c`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b * c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the sum of `a` and `b` times `c` instead of the arctangent of `b` and `c`.

DONE.
