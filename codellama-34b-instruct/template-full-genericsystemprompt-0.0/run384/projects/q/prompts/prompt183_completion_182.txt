  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first capture group of the `attempt1` regex is `undefined`, which would cause the function to return `undefined` instead of the expected file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first capture group of the `attempt1` regex is `null`, which would cause the function to return `null` instead of the expected file name and line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attempt1[1] === ""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first capture group of the `attempt1` regex is an empty string, which would cause the function to return an empty string instead of the expected file name and line number.

DONE.
