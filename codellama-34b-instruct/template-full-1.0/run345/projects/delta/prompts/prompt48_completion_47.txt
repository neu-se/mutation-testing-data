  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if `embedType` and `Object.keys(b)[0]` are equal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false, even if `embedType` and `Object.keys(b)[0]` are not equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType === Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true, even if `embedType` and `Object.keys(b)[0]` are not equal.

DONE.
