  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to `b + 1` instead of `b`, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to `b * 2` instead of `b`, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to `b - 1` instead of `b`, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
