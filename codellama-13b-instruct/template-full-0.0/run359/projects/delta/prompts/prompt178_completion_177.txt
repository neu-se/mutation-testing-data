  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherOp.retain` value is being used instead of the `firstLeft` value, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstOther.retain` value is being used instead of the `firstLeft` value, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because the `firstOther.retain` value is being used instead of the `firstLeft` value, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
