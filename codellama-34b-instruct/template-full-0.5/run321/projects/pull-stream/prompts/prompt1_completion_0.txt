  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only iterate once, instead of iterating over the keys in the `sources` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate twice, instead of iterating over the keys in the `sources` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate over the keys in the `sources` object, but the key would be a string instead of a number.

DONE.
