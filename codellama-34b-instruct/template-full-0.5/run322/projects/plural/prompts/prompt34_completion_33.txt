  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the slice method, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the slice method, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the length of the word as the starting point for the slice method, which would result in a different substring being extracted.

DONE.
