 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method would not be called on the promise, and `snapshot.state` would throw an error, causing the whole promise chain to reject.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `snapshot` would not have a `state` property, causing the `if` condition to fail and the promise chain to continue without resolving or rejecting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(){}
```
This would result in different behavior because `snapshot` would be a function, which does not have a `state` property, causing the `if` condition to fail and the promise chain to continue without resolving or rejecting.

DONE.
