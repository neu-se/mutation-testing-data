  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.inverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.inverse()` is a different function from `handler.invert()` and would likely produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(base)
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.invert(base)` is a different function from `handler.invert()` and would likely produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
handler.invert(base, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `handler.invert(base, true)` is a different function from `handler.invert()` and would likely produce a different result.

DONE.
