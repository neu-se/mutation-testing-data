Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the value from `b` instead of `a`, potentially leading to incorrect results when determining if the attributes differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `null`, causing the comparison to always return `false`, and thus all attributes would be considered equal regardless of their actual values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value in `a` is `undefined`, which would lead to attributes being included in the result even if they are equal, thus changing the intended logic of the `diff` function.

DONE.
