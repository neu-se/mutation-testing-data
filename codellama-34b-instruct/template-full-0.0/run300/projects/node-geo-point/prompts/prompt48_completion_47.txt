  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is called with a different argument, `φ2`, which is not the same as `φ1` in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is called with a different argument, `φ2`, which is not the same as `φ1` in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is called with a different argument, `φ1`, which is not the same as `φ2` in the original code.

DONE.
