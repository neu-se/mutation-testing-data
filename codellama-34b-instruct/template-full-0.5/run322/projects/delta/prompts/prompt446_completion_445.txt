  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 from the length of the current op, which would cause the iterator to return a different next op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the length of the current op, which would cause the iterator to return a different next op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the length of the current op, which would cause the iterator to return a different next op.

DONE.
