  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is negated, which would result in the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.re !== this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because it is checking if the real part of the complex number is equal to itself, which is always false. Therefore, the resulting behavior would be different from the original.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
this.im !== this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it is checking if the imaginary part of the complex number is equal to itself, which is always false. Therefore, the resulting behavior would be different from the original.

DONE.
