  Here are three potential answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const end = Index-1;
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prevent the final iteration of the loop, which is necessary for the `Delta` object to be correctly constructed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = end - index + 1;
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the `end` element in the iteration, which is not desired.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const length = end - index;
while (index < end && iter.hasNext()) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the iteration.

DONE.
