  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ends.promise.get`, which returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property. By adding `("head")` to the end of the expression, we are explicitly specifying the property to retrieve, which is unnecessary and could potentially cause issues if the `head` property is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("tail")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `ends.promise.get`, which returns a promise that resolves to the value of the `head` property. By changing the property to `tail`, we are retrieving a different value, which could cause issues if the `tail` property is not defined or if the code relies on the value of the `head` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ends.promise.get("head
