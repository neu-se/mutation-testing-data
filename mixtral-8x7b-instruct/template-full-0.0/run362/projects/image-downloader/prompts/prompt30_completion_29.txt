 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
' '.url.trimLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `url` property of a space character, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random().toString().url.trimLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it tries to access the `url` property of a random string generated by `Math.random()`, which would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.toUpperCase().trimLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the URL to uppercase before trimming leading whitespace, which might affect the URL's behavior when making the HTTP request.

These mutations test the robustness of the test suite by checking if it handles unexpected property access, type errors, and string manipulation.

DONE.
