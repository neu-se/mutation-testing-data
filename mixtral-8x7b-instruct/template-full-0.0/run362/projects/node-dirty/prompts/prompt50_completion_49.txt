 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this._data.get(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly accesses the internal `_data` Map, bypassing any potential caching or other behavior implemented by the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.get(Math.random() * 100)
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of using the provided `key`, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors in the `updater` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.set(key, this.get(key))
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value of the key to its own value, potentially causing an infinite loop or other unexpected behavior.

DONE.
