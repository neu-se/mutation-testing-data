  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { progressed(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling `notify` on the deferred object, but this alternative implementation is calling the `progressed` function directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0, undefined, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling `notify` with three arguments, but this alternative implementation is calling `notify` with only one argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (rejection) { progressed(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is calling `notify` on the deferred object, but this alternative implementation is calling the `progressed` function as a rejection handler.

DONE.
