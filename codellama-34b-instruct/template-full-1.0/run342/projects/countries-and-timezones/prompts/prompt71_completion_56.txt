  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + "abc")
```
This would result in different behavior because it will try to fetch the timezone with the name "nameabc", which is not the same as the original timezone with name "name".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it will try to fetch the timezone with name "name" and then multiply it by 2, which will result in an incorrect timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because it will try to fetch the timezone with the name "NAME", which is not the same as the original timezone with name "name".

DONE.
