  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b == null` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is `null` or `undefined`, whereas the original code `typeof b !== 'object'` would only evaluate to `true` if `b` is `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray(b)` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is an array, whereas the original code `typeof b !== 'object'` would only evaluate to `true` if `b` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Function
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Function` would evaluate to `true` if `b` is a function, whereas the original code `typeof b !== 'object'` would only evaluate to `true` if `b` is an object.

DONE.
