  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"any"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return true for any fulfilled promises, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled with a rejected value or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"none"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return false for any fulfilled promises, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled with a rejected value or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the negation of the original "progressed" function, causing the promise to be rejected if the progress function returns true, and fulfilled if the progress function returns false.

DONE.
