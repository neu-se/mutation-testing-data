  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.message` is a string, while `e` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `e.toString()` is a string, while `e` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(e)
```
This would result in different behavior because `JSON.stringify(e)` is a string, while `e` is an object.

DONE.
