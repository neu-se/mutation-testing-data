  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the callback function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a falsy value, and it would cause the callback function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, and it would cause the callback function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
