  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array with a single element, which is not the intended behavior of the `keys` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of an array of keys, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined` instead of an array of keys, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

DONE.
