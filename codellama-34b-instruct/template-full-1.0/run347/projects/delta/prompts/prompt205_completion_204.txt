  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 42 &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof otherOp.delete` will always evaluate to `'number'`, causing the surrounding code to behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'boolean' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === 'object' && thisOp.retain !== null))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof otherOp.delete` would evaluate to `'boolean'`, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.delete === 'string' &&
          (typeof thisOp.retain === 'number' ||
            (typeof thisOp.retain === '
