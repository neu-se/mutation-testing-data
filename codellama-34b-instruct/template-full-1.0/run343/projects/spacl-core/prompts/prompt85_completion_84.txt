  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment creates a shallow copy of the rule object, while the new code fragment creates a deep copy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone() && (Math.random() > 0.5 ? rule.clone() : null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment creates a deep copy of the rule object and then randomly returns either the copy or null. This would simulate a bug where the shallow copy is not working as expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(rule) => rule.clone() && rule.clone().name = 'Different Name'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment creates a deep copy of the rule object and then changes the name property of the copy. This would simulate a bug where the shallow copy is not working as expected.

DONE.
