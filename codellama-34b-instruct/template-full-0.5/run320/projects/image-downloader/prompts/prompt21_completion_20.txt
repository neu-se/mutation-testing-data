  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.replace('jpg', 'png')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the file extension of the destination file with 'png', which could cause issues if the file is not actually a PNG image.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.split('/')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first part of the destination path, which could cause issues if the path is not absolute.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.dest.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would convert the destination path to lowercase, which could cause issues if the path is case-sensitive.

DONE.
