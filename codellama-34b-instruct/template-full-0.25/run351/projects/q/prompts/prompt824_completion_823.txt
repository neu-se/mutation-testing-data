  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q can't apply finally callback");
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, but this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of the `callback` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    throw reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, but this replacement would throw an error regardless of the type of the `callback` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.fcall().then(function () {
    return reason;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only throws an error if the `callback` argument is not a function, but this replacement would return the `reason` argument instead of throwing an error.

DONE
