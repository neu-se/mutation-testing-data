  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would loop one extra time, potentially resulting in an out-of-bounds array access.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would skip over the last element in the array, potentially resulting in missing operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not include the final element in the array, potentially resulting in missed operations.

DONE.
