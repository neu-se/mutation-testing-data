  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` would return a rejected promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail, whereas `Q` would return a resolved promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to succeed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve()` would return a resolved promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to succeed, whereas `Q` would return a pending promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` would return a pending promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to fail, whereas `Q` would return a resolved promise, which would cause the `dispatch` method to succeed.

DONE.
