Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `defer` would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior when trying to resolve the promise, as `defer` typically expects a function or a valid value to work with.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer("error");
```
This would result in different behavior because passing a string like `"error"` to `defer` would not be a valid input, potentially leading to a situation where the promise is resolved with an incorrect value, thus altering the expected flow of promise resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `defer` may lead to the promise being resolved with an undefined value, which could cause downstream consumers of the promise to behave incorrectly or throw errors when they expect a valid value.

DONE.
