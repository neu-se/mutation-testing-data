  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` refers to the global object in non-strict mode, which is different from the `callback` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `call` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an array and does not have a `call` method.

DONE.
