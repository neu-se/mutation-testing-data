  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.off
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `off` method instead of `on`. This could potentially cause the event listener to be removed, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.emit
```
This code fragment uses the `emit` method to trigger the `close` event manually. This could potentially cause the event listener to be called multiple times, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
output.once
```
This code fragment uses the `once` method to add an event listener that is only called once. This could potentially cause the event listener to be called less frequently than expected, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
