  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` property might not exist on the `p` object, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.source.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` property might not exist on the `source` object, causing an error to be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = p.sink.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sink` property might not exist on the `sink` object, causing an error to be thrown.

DONE.
