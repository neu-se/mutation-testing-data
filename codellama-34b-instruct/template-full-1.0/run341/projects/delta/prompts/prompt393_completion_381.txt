  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter['next']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter['next']` references the `next` property of the `otherIter` object, which is not a function. Replacing `otherIter.next` with `otherIter['next']()` would cause the program to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns an `Op` object, which does not have a `length` property. Replacing `otherIter.next` with `otherIter.next().length` would cause the program to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next().insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns an `Op` object, which does not have an `insert` property. Replacing `otherIter.next` with `otherIter.next().insert
