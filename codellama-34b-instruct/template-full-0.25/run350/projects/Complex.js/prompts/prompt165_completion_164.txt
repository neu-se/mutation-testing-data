  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a property access, while the replacement code fragment is a function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a property access, while the replacement code fragment is an arithmetic operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a property access, while the replacement code fragment is an arithmetic operation.

DONE.
