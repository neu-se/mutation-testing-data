 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return 0 as the second element of the Complex number, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the real part of the current Complex number as the second element, instead of negating the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number as the second element, making the result unpredictable and dependent on the current state of the random number generator.

DONE.
