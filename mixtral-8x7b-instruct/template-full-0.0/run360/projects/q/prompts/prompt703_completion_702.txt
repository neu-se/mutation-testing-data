 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would no longer receive any arguments, causing it to always pass an empty array as the second argument to `promise.dispatch("apply", ...)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would receive `null` as the second argument instead of an array of arguments, causing `promise.dispatch("apply", ...)` to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ 0: 1, length: 1 }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fbound` function would receive an array-like object instead of a real array, which might cause `promise.dispatch("apply", ...)` to behave differently depending on the implementation of `dispatch`.

DONE.
