  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() && this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if both are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if `this` is infinite and `z` is not infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']() || this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if either `this` or `z` is infinite, while this new code checks if `z` is infinite or `this` is zero.

DONE.
