  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` list would always be empty, even if there are callbacks in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` list would always be null, even if there are callbacks in the queue.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cbs` list would always be undefined, even if there are callbacks in the queue.

DONE.
