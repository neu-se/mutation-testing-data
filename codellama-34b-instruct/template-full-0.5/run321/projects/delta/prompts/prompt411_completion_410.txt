  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasNext` method returns a boolean indicating whether there are more elements in the iteration, while the `hasNext` property is a getter that returns the next element in the iteration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `next` method returns the next element in the iteration, while the `next` property is a getter that returns the current element in the iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peek` method returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator, while the `peek` property is a getter that returns the current element in the iteration.

DONE.
