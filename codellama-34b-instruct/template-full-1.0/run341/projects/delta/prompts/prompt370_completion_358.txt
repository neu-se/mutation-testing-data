  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is not a method of the `Delta` class, and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a method of the `Delta` class, but it is not called with any arguments, so it would have no effect on the output of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method of the `Delta` class that deletes a specified number of characters from the `Delta` object, which would cause the output of the code to be different.

DONE.
