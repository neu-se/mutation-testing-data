  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'mice'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mouse'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "mouse." Replacing it with `'mice'` would result in incorrect behavior, as the plural form of "mouse" is "mice."

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cat'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mouse'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "mouse." Replacing it with `'cat'` would result in incorrect behavior, as the plural form of "cat" is "cats."

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'dog'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `'mouse'`, which is the correct plural form for the word "mouse." Replacing it with `'dog'` would result in incorrect behavior, as the plural form of "dog" is "dogs."
