  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to find the attribute 'a' in the elements, instead of the attribute 'base' which is the expected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'base href'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to find the attribute 'base href' in the elements, instead of the attribute 'base' which is the expected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a', 'href'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would try to find the attribute 'href' in the element 'a', instead of the attribute 'base' which is the expected behavior.

DONE.
