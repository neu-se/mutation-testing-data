  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `1 - 1`, which would result in a value of 0, while the new code fragment would result in a value of 2.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a - b`, which would result in a value of 0 if `a` and `b` are equal, while the new code fragment would result in a value of `a + b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is `a / b`, which would result in a value of 1 if `a` and `b` are equal, while the new code fragment would result in a value of `a * b`.

DONE.
