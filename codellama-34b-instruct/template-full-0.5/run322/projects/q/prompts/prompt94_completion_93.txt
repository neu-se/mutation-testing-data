  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any `index` greater than or equal to the length of the array, whereas the original code would only return `true` for indexes that are actually present in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false` for any `index` greater than the length of the array, whereas the original code would only return `false` for indexes that are actually present in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== this.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` for any `index` that is not equal to the length of the array, whereas the original code would only return `true` for indexes that are actually present in the array.

DONE.
