 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].slice.call(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array from the arguments object, whereas the original code uses the `array_slice` function which might have a different implementation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the `nodeArgs` array with `null`, causing an error when trying to access its properties in the following lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the `arguments` object of the current function, instead of the `nodeArgs` array passed as an argument.

DONE.
