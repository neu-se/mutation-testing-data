  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` returns a new promise that resolves when the original promise is resolved, but it does not modify the original promise. In the original code, `untrackRejection` is called on the original promise, which would not happen with this replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.catch` returns a new promise that resolves when the original promise is rejected, but it does not modify the original promise. In the original code, `untrackRejection` is called on the original promise, which would not happen with this replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {}, function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` returns a new promise that resolves when the original promise is resolved or rejected
