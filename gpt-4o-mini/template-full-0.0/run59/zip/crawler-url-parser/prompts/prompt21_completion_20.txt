Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the protocol of the base URL to HTTPS instead of HTTP, potentially leading to issues when resolving URLs that expect a specific protocol.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ftp://'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly set the base URL protocol to FTP, which is not suitable for web URLs and could cause parsing errors or unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://example.com'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would hardcode the base URL to a specific domain, ignoring the actual base URL provided by the user, which could lead to incorrect URL resolutions.

DONE.
