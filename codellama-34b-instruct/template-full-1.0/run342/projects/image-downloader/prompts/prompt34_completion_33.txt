  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a function or method that consumes the response data, but `0` is a number and does not have a `resume` method. When the code is executed, it would throw a `TypeError` because `0` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a function or method that consumes the response data, but `true` is a boolean value and does not have a `resume` method. When the code is executed, it would throw a `TypeError` because `true` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was expecting a function or method that consumes the response data, but `null` is a null reference and does not have a `resume` method. When the code is executed
