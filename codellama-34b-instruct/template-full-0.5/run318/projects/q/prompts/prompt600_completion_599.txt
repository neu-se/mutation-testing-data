  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would only contain the first argument passed to the `dispatch` method, rather than all of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would only contain the second argument passed to the `dispatch` method, rather than all of the arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would only contain all but the first argument passed to the `dispatch` method, rather than all of the arguments.

DONE.
