  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because when `allResolved()` is called on an array of promises, it returns a promise that resolves with an array of rejected promises.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject("Test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved()` would return a rejected promise with the value "Test".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Test")
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved()` would throw an error with the message "Test".

DONE.
