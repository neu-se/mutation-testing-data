  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with the `slashes` property set to `false`, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with the `slashes` property set to `null`, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL.parse()` method would return a different object, with the `slashes` property set to `undefined`, which would affect the parsing of the URL.

DONE.
