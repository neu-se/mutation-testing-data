  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false ? null : abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a strict equality check (`===`), while this new code fragment uses a weak equality check (`==`). This could cause the code to behave differently in certain edge cases, such as when `abort` is a non-boolean value.
