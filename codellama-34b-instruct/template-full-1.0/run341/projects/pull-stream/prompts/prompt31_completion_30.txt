  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the fourth argument of the `pull` function, which is not present in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the third argument of the `pull` function, which could potentially cause the function to execute differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read, ref[0], ref[1], ref[2] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a different value for the third argument of the `pull` function, which could potentially cause the function to execute differently.

DONE.
