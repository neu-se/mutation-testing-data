  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method is missing a required argument, which would cause the code to throw a `TypeError` at runtime.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method expects an object to be passed as the first argument, but passing `null` would cause the method to return a shallow clone of the original object, rather than a deep clone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule.clone([])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clone()` method expects an object to be passed as the first argument, but passing an empty array would cause the method to return an empty array, rather than a cloned object.

DONE.
