Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `once` function to handle the end of the stream, it logs the `end` value to the console, which does not trigger the intended cleanup or finalization logic.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return read(end, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the `read` function again with the same `end` and `cb` parameters, potentially leading to an infinite loop or repeated processing of the same data instead of properly handling the end of the stream.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Stream ended')
```
This would result in different behavior because it throws an error when the stream ends, which would disrupt the normal flow of the program and likely cause the application to crash instead of gracefully handling the end of the stream.

DONE.
