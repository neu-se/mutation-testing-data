  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid HTTP method, and the server would likely return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [args, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in the wrong order, which could cause the server to interpret the request incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, args.reverse()]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments would be passed in reverse order, which could cause the server to interpret the request incorrectly.

DONE.
