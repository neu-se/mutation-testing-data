  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the promise itself, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, rather than the value of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, rather than the value of the promise.

DONE.
