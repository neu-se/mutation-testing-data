 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedUrl.host === null && baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `===` operator instead of `==`, which checks for strict equality and would not return true if `parsedUrl.host` is null or undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!parsedUrl.host && baseUrlStr
