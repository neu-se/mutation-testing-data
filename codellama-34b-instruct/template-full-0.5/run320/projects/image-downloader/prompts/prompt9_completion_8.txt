  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of `path.extname`, causing the code to execute the opposite logic of what was intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename` returns the last portion of a path, while `path.extname` returns the file extension.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of a path, while `path.extname` returns the file extension.

DONE.
