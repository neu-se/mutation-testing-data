  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null value from the map function, but by replacing it with null, the code path that handles the aborted state will not be executed, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the aborted state to be represented by the same value as the constant "aborted", but by adding 1 to it, the code path that handles the aborted state will not be executed, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a non-null value from the map function, but by replacing it with undefined, the code path that handles the aborted state will not be executed, potentially leading to inconsistent behavior.

DONE.
