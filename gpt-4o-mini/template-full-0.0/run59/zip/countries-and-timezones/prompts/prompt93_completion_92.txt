Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `country.timezones` to be accessed without any filtering based on the `deprecated` property, potentially returning all timezones instead of the intended filtered result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would lead to the same issue as using `null`, where the `options` object would not be defined, causing the `deprecated` check to fail and returning all timezones instead of the filtered ones.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an options object with `deprecated: true` would cause the function to return all timezones, including those marked as deprecated, which is not the intended behavior of filtering out deprecated timezones.

DONE.
