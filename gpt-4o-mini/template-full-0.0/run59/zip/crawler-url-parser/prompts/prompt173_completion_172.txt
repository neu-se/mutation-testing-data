Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the logging method from `console.log`, which outputs messages to the console, to `console.error`, which outputs error messages, potentially altering how the output is perceived and handled by the environment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Debugging information:", url);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a string message to the log output, changing the format of the output and potentially providing more context than the original `console.log`, which would only log the value of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("URL:", baseUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because it logs a different variable (`baseUrl`) instead of the original context, which may lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the logged information, as it no longer reflects the intended output.

DONE.
