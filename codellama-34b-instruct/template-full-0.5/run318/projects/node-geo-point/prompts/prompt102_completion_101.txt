  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the longitude from radians to degrees, but this replacement code fragment uses a different formula to perform the conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180 + 360
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg` function to convert the longitude from radians to degrees, but this replacement code fragment uses a different formula to perform the conversion and adds an additional 360 degrees to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(λ2 + 540) % 360 - 180 + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `rad2deg`
