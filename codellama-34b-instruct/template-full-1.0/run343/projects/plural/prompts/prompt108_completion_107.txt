  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w+'s' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add an 's' to the end of the word, whereas the original code fragment would only add an 's' if the word was not already plural.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last character of the word, whereas the original code fragment would only remove the last character if it was an 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the last two characters of the word and replace them with 'i', whereas the original code fragment would only remove the last character if it was an 's' and replace it with 'es'.

DONE.
