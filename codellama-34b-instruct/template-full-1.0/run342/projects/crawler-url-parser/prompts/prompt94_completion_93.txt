  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('src')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the URL of the image or video contained in the `src` attribute, while the original code returns the URL in the `href` attribute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the text content of the tag, while the original code returns the URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).attr('href').split(',')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first part of the URL in the `href` attribute, while the original code returns the entire URL.

DONE.
