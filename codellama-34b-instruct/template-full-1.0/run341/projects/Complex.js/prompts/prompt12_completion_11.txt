  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus sign is missing in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*y
```
This would result in different behavior because the product operator was not in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the minus operator was not in the original code fragment.

DONE.
