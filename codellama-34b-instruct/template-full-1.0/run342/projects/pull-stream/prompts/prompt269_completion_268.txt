  Sure! Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with different code fragments:
```
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return cb(null, end)
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `end`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return cb(end, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is not the same as `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    return cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `err` is not the same as `null`.

DONE.
