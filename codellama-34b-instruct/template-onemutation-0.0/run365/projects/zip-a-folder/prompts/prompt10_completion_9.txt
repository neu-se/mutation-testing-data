  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `src` parameter is not a glob, and `false` when it is a glob. This would cause the `zipArchive.glob()` method to be called when it should not be, and vice versa.
