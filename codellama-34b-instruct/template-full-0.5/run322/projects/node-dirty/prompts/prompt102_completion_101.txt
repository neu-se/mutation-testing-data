  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear()
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear()` removes all elements from the map, whereas `delete()` removes only the specified key.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `set()` with an undefined value would set the value for the specified key to undefined, whereas `delete()` would remove the key from the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key)
this._data.set(key, undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` would remove the key from the map, and then `set()` would set the value for the specified key to undefined.

DONE.
