  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be parsed with the `slashesDenoteHost` and `queryString` options set to `false`, which could result in a different URL being generated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, true, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` would be set to `null`, which could result in a different URL being generated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slashesDenoteHost` option would be set to `false`, which could result in a different URL being generated.

DONE.
