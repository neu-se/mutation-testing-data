  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement uses the `toLowerCase()` method on the `data` variable, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement adds 1 to the `data` variable, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split(' ')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `data` variable directly, while this replacement splits the `data` variable into an array of strings using the space character as the delimiter, and then takes the first element of the array, which could potentially change the value of the variable.

DONE.
