  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment contains a placeholder value that is not used, so changing it to `null` would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a valid JS value, but it is not equal to `null`. The code would still be incorrect because it is expecting a value that is not `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is expecting a function, but `{}` is an empty object and not a function.

DONE.
