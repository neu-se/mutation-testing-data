  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while the original code uses the `rest` method to return the remaining elements of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.filter(() => true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method returns a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while the original code uses the `rest` method to return the remaining elements of an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements of an array, while the original code uses the `rest` method to return the remaining elements of an array.

DONE.
