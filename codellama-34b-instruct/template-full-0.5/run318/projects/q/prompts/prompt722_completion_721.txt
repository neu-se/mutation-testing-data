  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the value is not a promise instead of if it is a promise and fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of fulfilled.

DONE.
