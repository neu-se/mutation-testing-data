  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined` This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are undefined, rather than checking if they are missing from the object altogether.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `!object.hasOwnProperty('latitude')` This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` property is not present in the object, rather than checking if it is missing from the object altogether.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with: `object.latitude == 0 || object.longitude == 0` This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `latitude` and `longitude` properties are equal to 0, rather than checking if they are missing from the object altogether.

DONE.
