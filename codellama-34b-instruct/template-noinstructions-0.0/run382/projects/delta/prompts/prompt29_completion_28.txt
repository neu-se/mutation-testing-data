  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert()
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert()` would invert the keys and values of the `base` object, whereas `base` would simply return the `base` object as is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(true)` would invert the keys and values of the `base` object, whereas `base` would simply return the `base` object as is. Additionally, the `true` argument would cause the inverted keys and values to be sorted in descending order, whereas `base` would not sort the keys and values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
base.invert(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `base.invert(false)` would invert the keys and values of the `base` object, whereas `base` would simply return the `base` object as is. Additionally
