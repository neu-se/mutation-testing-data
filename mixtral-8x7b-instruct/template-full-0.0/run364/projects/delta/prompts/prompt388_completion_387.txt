 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to stop one operation early when comparing lengths of operations in the two deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to skip two operations instead of one when comparing lengths of operations in the two deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
thisIter.peekLength() + index
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to skip an incorrect number of operations when comparing lengths of operations in the two deltas, depending on the value of `index`.

DONE.
