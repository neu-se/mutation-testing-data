  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stringified-object", options
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `stringify` is not defined in the original code, so the file would not be written correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, "stringified-options"
```
This would result in different behavior because the options object would be passed as a string, which would likely cause an error when trying to access its properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, { ...options, encoding: "base64" }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` option would be set to `"base64"`, which would cause the file to be written in a different format.

DONE.
