  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `arguments` to refer to the arguments passed to the `Q.invoke` function, and `2` to refer to the second argument, which is the array of invocation arguments. By changing the `2` to `1`, the code would be referring to the first argument instead, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using `arguments` to refer to the arguments passed to the `Q.invoke` function, and `2` to refer to the second argument, which is the array of invocation arguments. By using `array_slice(arguments, 2)`, the code would be referring to the second argument, and the function would behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in
