 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```python
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL\_CHARACTER constant is changed to '1', which may affect the diff() function's output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String.fromCharCode(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10))
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL\_CHARACTER constant is replaced with a random character between '0' and '9', which may affect the diff() function's output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
String.fromCharCode(65535)
```
This would result in different behavior because the NULL\_CHARACTER constant is replaced with a non-printable character, which may affect the diff() function's output.

DONE.
