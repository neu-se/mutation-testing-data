  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this == null
```
This would result in different behavior because `this == null` will always be false, even if the promise is rejected or pending, whereas `this` refers to the current object and is only null when the function is called as a constructor function or when the context is explicitly set to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor.name` would return the function name of the constructor function that created the current object, whereas `this` refers to the current object and changing it to `this.constructor.name` would break the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
valueOf(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` is a function that returns the primitive value of an object, whereas `this` refers to the current object and changing it to `valueOf(this)` would break the code.

DONE.
