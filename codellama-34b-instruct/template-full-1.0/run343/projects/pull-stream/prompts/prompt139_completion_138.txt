  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return one less than the original value of `end`, which could potentially cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return one more than the original value of `end`, which could potentially cause the function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return twice the original value of `end`, which could potentially cause the function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
