  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a function that waits for all promises to be settled, whereas `any` is a function that returns the first resolved promise of an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
allSettled
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a function that waits for all promises to be settled, whereas `allSettled` is a function that returns the states of an array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because `allResolved` is a function that waits for all promises to be settled, whereas `defer` is a function that creates a deferred object.

DONE.
