  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `progressListeners` array instead of checking if `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `resolvedPromise` is falsy instead of checking if it's truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof resolvedPromise === "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `resolvedPromise` is undefined instead of checking if it's truthy.

DONE.
