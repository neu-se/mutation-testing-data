  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which would result in a different outcome for the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be notified instead of resolved or rejected, which would result in a different outcome for the `then` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.never
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to never be resolved or rejected, which would result in a different outcome for the `then` method.

DONE.
