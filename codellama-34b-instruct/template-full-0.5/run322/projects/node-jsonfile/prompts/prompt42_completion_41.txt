  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `stringify` function with the `options` object as the second argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code only passes `obj` as an argument to `stringify`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `JSON.stringify` function with the `obj` object as the argument, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls `stringify` with `obj` and `options` as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, { encoding: 'utf-8' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `stringify` function with the `obj` object and an `encoding` option set to `'utf-8'`, which is not what the original code does. The original code calls `stringify` with `
