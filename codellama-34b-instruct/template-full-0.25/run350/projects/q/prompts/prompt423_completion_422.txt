  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object`, which may have a different implementation than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object` with an empty argument list, which may have a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `inspect` method on the `object` with an empty argument list, which may have a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
