  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value, whereas `Q.reject` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason. Using `Q.resolve` instead of `Q.reject` would cause the promise to be resolved with the error object, which would not result in the desired behavior of rejecting the promise with the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(error)` is a function that rejects a promise with a reason, whereas `Q.resolve` is a function that resolves a promise with a value. Using `Q.reject(error)` instead of `Q.resolve` would cause the promise to be rejected with the error object, which would result in the desired behavior of rejecting the promise with the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
