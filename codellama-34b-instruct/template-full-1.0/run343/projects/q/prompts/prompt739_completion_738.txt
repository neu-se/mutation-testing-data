  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a string containing the placeholder, rather than the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return null, rather than the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return undefined, rather than the original value.

DONE.
