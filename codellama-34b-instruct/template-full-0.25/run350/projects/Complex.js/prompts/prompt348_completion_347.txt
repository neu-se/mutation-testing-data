  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment uses `-b`, which is the negative of `b`. This could cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase, leading to different results in the subsequent calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment uses `b + 1`, which is the sum of `b` and 1. This could cause the resulting complex number to have a different magnitude and phase, leading to different results in the subsequent calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `b` variable, which is a complex number, and the new code fragment uses `b * 2
