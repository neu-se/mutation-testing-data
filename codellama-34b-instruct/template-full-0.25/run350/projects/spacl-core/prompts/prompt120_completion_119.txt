  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.length` would return the length of the `ctx` array, while `ctx` would return the array itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx[0]` would return the first element of the `ctx` array, while `ctx` would return the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ctx.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `ctx` except the first one, while `ctx` would return the entire array.

DONE.
