  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(err.message)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only emits the error message, while the replaced code fragment emits a new error object with the same message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error object, while the replaced code fragment emits null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error object, while the replaced code fragment emits undefined.

DONE.
