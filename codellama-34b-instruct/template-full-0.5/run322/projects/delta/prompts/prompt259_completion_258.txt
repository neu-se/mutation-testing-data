  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a JavaScript keyword and would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the `insert` property of the current operation, rather than the `insert` property of the other operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a JavaScript keyword and would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
