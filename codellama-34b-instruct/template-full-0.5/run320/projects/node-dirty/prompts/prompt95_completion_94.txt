  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string value, but the new code would return a string with all characters in uppercase, which could cause the JSON parser to fail or return unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string value, but the new code would return the length of the string, which could cause the JSON parser to fail or return unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a string value, but the new code would return an array of individual characters, which could cause the JSON parser to fail or return unexpected results.

DONE.
