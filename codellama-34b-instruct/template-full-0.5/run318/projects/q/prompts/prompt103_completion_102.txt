  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the next element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the previous element in the array instead of the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this[index] = "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the current element in the array, which could have unintended consequences.

DONE.
