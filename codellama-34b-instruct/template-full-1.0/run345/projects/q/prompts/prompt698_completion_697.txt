  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```4```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was designed to accept any truthy value, not just the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```0```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was designed to accept any falsy value, not just the number 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```primes[index]```
This would result in different behavior because the original code was designed to accept any value, not just a value from a specific array.

DONE.
