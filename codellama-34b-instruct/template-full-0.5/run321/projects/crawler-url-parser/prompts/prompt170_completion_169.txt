  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `==` operator, which performs type coercion, while the replacement code uses the `===` operator, which does not perform type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain != pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `==` operator, which performs type coercion, while the replacement code uses the `!=` operator, which does not perform type coercion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain !== pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used the `==` operator, which performs type coercion, while the replacement code uses the `!==` operator, which does not perform type coercion.

DONE.
