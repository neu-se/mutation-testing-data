  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `err` or `true`, but this code fragment calls `cb` with `null` and `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `err` or `true`, but this code fragment calls `cb` with `data` only.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err || data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls `cb` with `err` or `true`, but this code fragment calls `cb` with `err` or `data`.

DONE.
