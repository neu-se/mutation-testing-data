  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(b) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos(b)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cosm1` is a method that calculates the cosine of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin(b)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cosm1` is a method that calculates the cosine of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan(b)` would return a value between -1 and 1, while `cosm1` is a method that calculates the cosine of a complex number.

DONE.
