  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start at index 1 instead of 0, potentially skipping the first line of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start at index -1, potentially causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would start at index 0, potentially causing the predicate function to be called with an empty line.

DONE.
