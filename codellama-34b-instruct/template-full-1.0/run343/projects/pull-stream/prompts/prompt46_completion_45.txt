  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the for loop to execute zero times, which would not execute any of the code inside the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at the last index of the arguments array, rather than the first. This would cause the code inside the loop to be executed with the last argument instead of the first one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start the loop at a random index within the arguments array. This would cause the code inside the loop to be executed with a random argument each time the loop is executed.

DONE.
