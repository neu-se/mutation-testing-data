  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `tokens` is an empty array, which is a valid input for the `parse` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true` when `tokens` is an empty array, which is a valid input for the `parse` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false` when `tokens` is an empty array, which is a valid input for the `parse` function.

DONE.
