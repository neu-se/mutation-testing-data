  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` is always true, regardless of the operation's type, while `otherOp.delete` only applies to delete operations. This would cause the resulting delta to always retain the other op's data, regardless of whether it should be retained or deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.attributes` is an object containing the attributes of the other op, while `otherOp.delete` is a boolean indicating whether the other op is a delete operation. This would cause the resulting delta to always retain the other op's attributes, regardless of whether it should be retained or deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.length` is the length of the other op's data, while `otherOp.delete` is a boolean
