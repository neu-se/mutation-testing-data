  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
all
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a different function that takes a promise for an array of promises and returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` is a different function that takes a promise for an array of promises and returns a promise for an array of values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.all` is a different function that takes an array of promises and returns a promise for an array of values.

DONE.
