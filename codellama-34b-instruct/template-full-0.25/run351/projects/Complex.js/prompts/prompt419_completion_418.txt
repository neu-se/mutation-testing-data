  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero'](<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is not defined on the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined on the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN'](<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN` method is not defined on the `Complex` class, so it would throw an error.

DONE.
