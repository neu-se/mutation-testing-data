  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.delete(key, cbs);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method would remove the key and its corresponding `cbs` list from the queue, while the original code fragment only adds new `cbs` to the existing list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would set the key to `undefined`, which would cause the `get` method to return `undefined` instead of the existing value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method would remove all keys and their corresponding `cbs` lists from the queue, while the original code fragment only adds new `cbs` to the existing list.

DONE.
