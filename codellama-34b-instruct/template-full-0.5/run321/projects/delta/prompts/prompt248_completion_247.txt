  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over the wrong iterator, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over one more element than it should, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over one fewer element than it should, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
