 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
... of this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it iterates over the entries (key-value pairs) instead of just keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
... of Array.from(this._data.keys())
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the keys to an array before iterating, which may cause issues if the number of keys is large.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
... of Object.keys(this._data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the keys to an array using Object.keys(), which may cause issues if the number of keys is large and may not preserve the order of keys.

DONE.
