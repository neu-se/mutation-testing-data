  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 180 degrees, which could cause errors in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be double the actual bearing, which could cause errors in the calculation of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the bearing calculation would be off by 180 degrees in the opposite direction, which could cause errors in the calculation of the destination point.

DONE.
