  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it reverses the order of the arguments passed to the `cb` function. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the function is not designed to handle this specific case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it reverses the order of the arguments passed to the `cb` function. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the function is not designed to handle this specific case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, data)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it passes the `data` argument to the `cb` function instead of `null`. This change may cause the test suite to fail if the function is not designed to handle this specific case.

DONE.
