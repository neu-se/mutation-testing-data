  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekLength()` returns the length of the next operation, whereas `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `next()` returns the next operation, whereas `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because `peek()` returns the next operation, whereas `hasNext()` returns a boolean indicating whether there is a next operation.

DONE.
