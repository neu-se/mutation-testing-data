  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return `true` if either `abort` or `true` is `true`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` even if `abort` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return `false` if either `abort` or `false` is `false`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
