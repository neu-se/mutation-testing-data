  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.includes(text)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is removed, which would cause the code to always return `true` regardless of whether the text is included in the URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `indexOf` method is used instead of `includes`, which would cause the code to return `true` if the text is found at any position in the URL, rather than only if it is found at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method is used instead of `includes`, which would cause the code to return `true` if the text is found anywhere in the URL, rather than only if it is found at the beginning.

DONE.
