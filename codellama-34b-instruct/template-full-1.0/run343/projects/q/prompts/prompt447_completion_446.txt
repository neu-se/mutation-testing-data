  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending` is a method of the `Promise` class, but it is not a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method of the `Promise` class, but it is not a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a method of the `Promise` class, but it is not a property.

DONE.
