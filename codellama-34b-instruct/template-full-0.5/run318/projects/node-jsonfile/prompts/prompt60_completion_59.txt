  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Buffer.isBuffer(content)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the opposite of what the original code fragment would return.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.isBuffer
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `undefined`, as `content` is not a buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer(content.toString())
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the string representation of `content` is a buffer, which is not the same as checking if `content` itself is a buffer.

DONE.
