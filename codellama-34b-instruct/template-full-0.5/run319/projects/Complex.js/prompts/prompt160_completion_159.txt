  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value was infinite, while the new code fragment is checking if the value is greater than infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was checking if the value was infinite, while the new code fragment is checking if the value is twice as large as infinity.

DONE.
