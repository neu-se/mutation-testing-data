 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain === pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses strict equality comparison, which checks for both value and type. If the `domain` property exists in both objects but has different types (e.g., one is a string and the other is a number), the strict equality comparison will fail, while the loose equality comparison (`==`) in the original code would still return true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.hasOwnProperty('domain') && linkurl.domain == pageurl.domain
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `domain` property exists in the `linkurl` object before comparing it. If the `domain` property is inherited from the prototype chain, the original code would still return true, while this code would return false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.domain.toLowerCase() == pageurl.domain.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in
