  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Q.defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which creates a new deferred object with the given placeholder as the initial value. Replacing the placeholder with `null` would cause the deferred object to be created with a null value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the deferred object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var ends = Q.defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Q.defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which creates a new deferred object with the given placeholder as the initial value. Replacing the placeholder with `undefined` would cause the deferred object to be created with an undefined value, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the code that uses the deferred object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
