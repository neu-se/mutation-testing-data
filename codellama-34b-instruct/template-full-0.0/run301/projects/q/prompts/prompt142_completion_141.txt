  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; !p; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!p` operator would always return `true`, even if `p` is a promise that resolves to a truthy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source` property would be assigned to `p` before the loop condition is evaluated, which could cause the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise; p.source; p = p.source.source
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p.source.source` property would be assigned to `p` before the loop condition is evaluated, which could cause the loop to run indefinitely.

DONE.
