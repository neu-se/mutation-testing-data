  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call()` expects an explicit `this` as its first argument, whereas `apply()` uses the object on which it is called as its `this` context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the `this` context completely and call the function directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that has a `this` context of `null`, which is likely not what the original author intended.

DONE.
