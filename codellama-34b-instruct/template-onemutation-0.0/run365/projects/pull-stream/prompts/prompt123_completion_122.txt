  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && cb(end)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only returns `cb(end)` if `end` is truthy, while the mutated code fragment always returns `cb(end)`, regardless of the value of `end`. This change would cause the function to return a different value in some cases, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses this function.
