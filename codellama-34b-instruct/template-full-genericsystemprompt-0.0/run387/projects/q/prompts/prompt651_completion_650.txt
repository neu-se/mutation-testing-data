  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is not a valid operation for a promise, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a valid operation for a promise, but it would not have the same effect as "post" in this context, as it would not cause the promise to be resolved with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"resolve"
```
This would result in different behavior because "resolve" is a valid operation for a promise, and would cause the promise to be resolved with the given value, but it would not have the same effect as "post" in this context, as it would not cause the promise to be resolved with the given value in a future turn.

DONE.
