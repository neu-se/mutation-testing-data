  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chilli'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the singular form of the word instead of the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chillis'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the plural form of the word instead of the singular form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'chill'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a completely different word instead of the original word.

DONE.
