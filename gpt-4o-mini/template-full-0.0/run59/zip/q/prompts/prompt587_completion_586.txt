Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code does not pass a second argument to `Q.async`, which may lead to unexpected handling of the generator's execution context or error propagation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.spawn(makeGenerator())
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calls `Q.spawn` with the generator function itself, while this change calls it with the result of invoking the generator function immediately, which would not return a generator object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator.bind(this))
```
This would result in different behavior because binding the `makeGenerator` function to `this` changes the context in which the generator function is executed, potentially altering the behavior of the generator if it relies on `this` for its logic.

DONE.
