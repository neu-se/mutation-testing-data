  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.exp` and `Math.log` are inverse functions, so substituting one for the other would change the meaning of the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log10
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log10` computes the base-10 logarithm instead of the natural logarithm, leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.log2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.log2` computes the base-2 logarithm instead of the natural logarithm, leading to a different result.

DONE.
