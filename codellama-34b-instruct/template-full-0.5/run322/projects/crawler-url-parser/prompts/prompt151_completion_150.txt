  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host !== pageurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the hostnames are equal, while this code fragment checks if they are not equal. This would cause the function to return "internal" for links that have the same hostname but different paths, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host.includes(pageurl.host)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the hostnames are equal, while this code fragment checks if the hostname of the link includes the hostname of the page. This would cause the function to return "internal" for links that have the same hostname but different paths, which is not the desired behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.hostname === pageurl.hostname
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the hostnames are equal, while this code fragment checks if
