 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + dest
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to create a file in the current directory with a name derived from `dest`, instead of using the provided `dest` as the file path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd() + '/' + dest
