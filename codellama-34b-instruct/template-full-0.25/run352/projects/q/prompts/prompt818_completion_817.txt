  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `fulfilled` callback is called when the promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `progressed` callback is called when the promise makes progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method is only called when the promise is rejected, and the `rejected` callback is called when the promise is rejected.

DONE.
