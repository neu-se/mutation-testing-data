  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, while the original code would just log a message and continue executing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `undefined`, while the original code would return `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `2`, while the original code would return `0`.

DONE.
