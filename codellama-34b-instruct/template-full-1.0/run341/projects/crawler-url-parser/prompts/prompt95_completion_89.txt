  
Option 1: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr).format()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `format` method of the `URL` object, which would return a string representation of the URL, rather than the `baseUrlStr` variable, which could potentially have a different value.

Option 2: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr + '/' + currentUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would combine the `baseUrlStr` and `currentUrlStr` variables in a different way than the original code, potentially resulting in a different URL.

Option 3: The placeholder can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` instead of a value from the `A` object, which could affect the behavior of the function.

DONE.
