if (promise && promise._state) {
    promise._state = 'rejected';

This would result in different behavior because it would force the promise to be in the rejected state, regardless of whether it was resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return promise && promise.then(undefined, noop);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise that is resolved with the value of the `noop` function, which is always `undefined`, regardless of the original promise's resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
try {
    return promise && promise.then(undefined, noop);
} catch (e) {
    return Q.reject(e);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new promise that is resolved with the value of the `noop` function, but if the `promise` is rejected, it would catch the re
