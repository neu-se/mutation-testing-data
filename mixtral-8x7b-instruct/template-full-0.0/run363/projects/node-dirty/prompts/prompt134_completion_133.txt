 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'key'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the key from a variable to a string literal. The code would no longer use the actual key from the iteration, but instead would always use the string 'key'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.key
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the object's key property, assuming it exists. If the object doesn't have a key property, this would cause an error. Additionally, if the key property has a different value than the key variable used in the original code, the behavior would change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of using the key variable. This would likely cause an error when trying to use the random number as a key in the `_data` object.

DONE.
