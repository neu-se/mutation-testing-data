  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code. By replacing the placeholder with `Q.onerror()`, the code would be calling the error handler function, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(exception)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code. By replacing the placeholder with `Q.onerror(exception)`, the code would be calling the error handler function with the `exception` object, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.onerror(new Error())
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.onerror` is a function that handles errors, but it is not being called in the original code
