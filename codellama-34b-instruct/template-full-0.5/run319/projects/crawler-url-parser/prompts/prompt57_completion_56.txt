  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("https://", "http://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all instances of "https://" with "http://", which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace all instances of "http://" with "https://", which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace("https://", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove all instances of "https://", which could cause the URL to be interpreted differently by the code.

DONE.
