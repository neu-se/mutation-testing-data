 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1.6
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the tile calculation due to a different base for the exponent.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the mathematical constant e (2.718...) instead of 2, leading to different tile calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / Math.cos(coordinate.latitude * Math.PI / 180)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calculates the denominator inside the `Math.log` function, which may cause issues if the `Math.cos` function returns 0 or a negative value.

DONE.
