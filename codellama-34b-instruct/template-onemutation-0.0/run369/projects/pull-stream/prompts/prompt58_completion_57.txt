  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `done` is a function, and `done === null` would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` is not provided as an argument. In the original code, `!done` would evaluate to `true` if `done` is not provided, which is the desired behavior.

DONE.
