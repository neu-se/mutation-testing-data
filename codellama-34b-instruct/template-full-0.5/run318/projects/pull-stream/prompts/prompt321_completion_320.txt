  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1` constant is not a valid value for the `end` parameter of the `read` function, and would cause the function to return an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return `null` instead of `data`, which would break the logic of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `read` function to return `null` instead of `data`, which would break the logic of the program.

DONE.
