  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random number to the data, which would cause the `field` function to return a different result, potentially filtering out valid data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.substring(0, data.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the last character of the data, which would cause the `field` function to return a different result, potentially filtering out valid data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `field` function to return `null`, which would cause the `filter` function to return an empty array, potentially filtering out valid data.

DONE.
