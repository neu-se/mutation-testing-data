Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because using `null` instead of `void 0` changes the first argument passed to the `apply` method, which may affect how the function being called interprets the context (`this` value) when executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[undefined, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because while `undefined` and `void 0` are often treated the same in JavaScript, explicitly using `undefined` can lead to different behavior in certain contexts, especially if the function being called relies on strict equality checks.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[args, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `args` as both the first and second argument to the `apply` method means that the function will receive the same array for both the context and the arguments, which is not the intended behavior of applying the function with a separate context and arguments.

DONE.
