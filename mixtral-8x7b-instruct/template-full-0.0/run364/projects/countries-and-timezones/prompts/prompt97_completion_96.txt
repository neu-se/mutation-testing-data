 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getTimezone('non-existent')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a non-existent timezone, possibly causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
timezones['non-existent']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access a non-existent timezone directly from the `timezones` object, possibly causing an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
getTimezone(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to retrieve a timezone with a null value, which might not be handled correctly by the `getTimezone` function, causing an error or unexpected behavior.

DONE.
