  thank you for your response. I'll be happy to provide you with some mutations for the code snippet you provided.

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would fail to handle the case where the insert operation has a length of 0, which can occur in valid operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would skip over the last operation in the insert operation, which could cause the insert to be incomplete.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would double the length of the insert operation, causing the delta to be too large and the insert to be followed by unnecessary retain operations.

DONE.
