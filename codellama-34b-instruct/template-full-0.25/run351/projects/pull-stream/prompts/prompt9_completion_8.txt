  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in throughs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throughs` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the loop would iterate over different keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in sources
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sources` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the loop would iterate over different keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k in exports
```
This would result in different behavior because the `exports` object is not the same as the `sinks` object, and the loop would iterate over different keys.

DONE.
