Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly increase the index adjustment when a delete operation is encountered, potentially skipping over characters that should be accounted for.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly decrease the index adjustment when a delete operation is encountered, leading to an incorrect final index that does not accurately reflect the number of characters deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the length of the delete operation entirely, causing the index to remain unchanged regardless of how many characters were deleted, which could lead to incorrect positioning in the text.

DONE.
