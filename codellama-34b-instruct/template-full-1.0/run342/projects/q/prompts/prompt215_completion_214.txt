  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the expression `isPromiseAlike(null)` to always return `false`, while the original code `isPromiseAlike(value)` would cause the expression to return `true` if the value of `value` is a promise-like object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the expression `isPromiseAlike(undefined)` to always return `false`, while the original code `isPromiseAlike(value)` would cause the expression to return `true` if the value of `value` is a promise-like object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ then: function() {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the expression `isPromiseAlike({ then: function() {} })` to always return `true`, while the original code `isPromiseAlike(value)` would cause
