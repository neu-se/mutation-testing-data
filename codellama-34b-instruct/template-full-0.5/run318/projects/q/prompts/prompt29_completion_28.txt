  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length + 1` expression would always be truthy, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length - 1` expression would always be falsy, causing the loop to never run.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `laterQueue.length * 2` expression would always be truthy, causing the loop to run twice as many times as it should.

DONE.
