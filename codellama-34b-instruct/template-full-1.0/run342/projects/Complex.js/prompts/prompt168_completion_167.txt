  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` variable is not defined, so the function will throw an error instead of returning a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z['im'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z` argument is a complex number, so `z['im']` will always be zero, causing the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` instead of `Complex['NAN']` when it encounters an infinite value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](z['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `z` argument is a complex number, so `z['re']` will always be non-zero, causing the function to return `Complex['NAN']` instead of `Complex['INFINITY']` when it encounters an infinite value
