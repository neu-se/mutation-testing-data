  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `thisIter.peekLength()` to get the length of the current operation, while the modified code fragment uses `thisIter.peekLength() + 1`, which would cause the code to skip over the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'` to check if the current operation is an insertion, while the modified code fragment uses `thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'`, which would cause the code to treat deletions as insertions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
offset < index
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `offset < index` to check if the current operation is before the specified index, while the modified
