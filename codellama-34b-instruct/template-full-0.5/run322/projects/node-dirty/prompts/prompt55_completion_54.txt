  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'error'` event is emitted when there is an error, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is ready to accept more data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'close'` event is emitted when the write stream is closed, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is ready to accept more data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `'read_close'` event is emitted when the read stream is closed, whereas the `'drain'` event is emitted when the write stream is ready to accept more data.

DONE.
