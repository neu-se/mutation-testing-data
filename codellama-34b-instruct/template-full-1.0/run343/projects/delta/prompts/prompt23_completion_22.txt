  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if the attribute is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```a.hasOwnProperty(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because `hasOwnProperty` checks if the attribute is defined on the object itself, not on its prototype chain. If the attribute is defined on the prototype, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```isEqual(b[key], a[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because `isEqual` checks if two values are equal, not if the attribute is defined or not. If the attribute is defined, but its value is not equal to `a[key]`, the `if` statement would evaluate to `false`.

DONE.
