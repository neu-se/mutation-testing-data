  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a `Delta` object, while this code fragment returns a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a `Delta` object, while this code fragment returns `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta({ ops: [] })
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a `Delta` object with the same contents as the current object, while this code fragment returns a new empty `Delta` object.
