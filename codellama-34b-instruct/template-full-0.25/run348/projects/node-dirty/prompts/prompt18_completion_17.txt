  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. This could cause the `set` method to behave differently, especially if the `cbs` array is modified later in the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.filter(Boolean)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.filter(Boolean)` filters out any falsy values from the `cbs` array, whereas `cbs` is a reference to the original array. This could cause the `set` method to behave differently, especially if the `cbs` array contains any falsy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.concat([])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cbs.concat([])` creates a new array by concatenating the `cbs` array with an empty array, whereas `c
