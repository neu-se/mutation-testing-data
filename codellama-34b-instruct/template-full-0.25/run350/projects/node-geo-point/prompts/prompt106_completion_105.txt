  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `Math.pow` raises a number to a power.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sqrt` calculates the square root of a number, while `Math.pow` raises a number to a power.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random` generates a random number between 0 and 1, while `Math.pow` raises a number to a power.

DONE.
