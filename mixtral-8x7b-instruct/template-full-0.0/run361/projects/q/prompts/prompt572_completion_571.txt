 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be `null` instead of the expected object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
window
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be the `window` object (in a browser environment) instead of the expected object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => this
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `this` would be determined by the `call` or `apply` method used to invoke the function, instead of being bound to the object as in the original code.

DONE.
