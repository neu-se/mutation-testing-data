  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, generate()
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `null`, and it would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, generate() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the result of `generate()`, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, generate() * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would multiply the result of `generate()` by 2, which would cause the function to return a different value.

DONE.
