  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh(a) + Math.cos(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `cosh` function to calculate the hyperbolic cosine of `a`, while this replacement uses the `cos` function to calculate the cosine of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh(a) + Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `sinh` function to calculate the hyperbolic sine of `a`, while this replacement uses the `sin` function to calculate the sine of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh(a) + Math.tan(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `tanh` function to calculate the hyperbolic tangent of `a`, while this replacement uses the `tan` function to calculate the tangent of `b`.

DONE.
