  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.insert?.length ?? 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the length of the insert operation with the length of the retained operation, resulting in incorrect behavior when the retained operation is longer than the insert operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.delete.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the length of the retained operation with the length of the delete operation, resulting in incorrect behavior when the retained operation is longer than the delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
elem.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the length of the retained operation with the length of the retained operation, resulting in incorrect behavior when the retained operation is shorter than the retained operation.

DONE.
