  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the added `^` at the beginning of the pattern negates the character set, meaning that the pattern will match any word that does not end in a vowel.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\doe$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the added `\doe` at the beginning of the pattern will match any word that ends in "doe", regardless of whether it ends in "o" or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[aeiouy]e$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the added `e` at the end of the pattern will match any word that ends in a vowel followed by an "e".

DONE.
