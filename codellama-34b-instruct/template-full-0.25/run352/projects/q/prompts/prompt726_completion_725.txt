  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)).state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)).state === "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is pending instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect(<PLACEHOLDER>)).state === "settled"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected) instead of just fulfilled.

DONE.
