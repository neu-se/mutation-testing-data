  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to always include the imaginary part of the complex number, even if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === b
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to never include the imaginary part of the complex number, even if it is non-zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b === 0
```
This change will cause the `toString` method to include the imaginary part of the complex number only if the real part is zero.

DONE.
