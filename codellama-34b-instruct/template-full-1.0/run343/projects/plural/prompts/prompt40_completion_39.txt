  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/g, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the global flag to the regular expression, which matches all occurrences in the string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'xes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the suffix from "ices" to "xes".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'esplayer' }
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the word "esplayer" to the end of the string, instead of just the suffix.

DONE.
