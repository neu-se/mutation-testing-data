  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the value, which would change the result of the `Q` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the value by 2, which would change the result of the `Q` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the value, which would change the result of the `Q` function.

DONE.
