  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have checked if the index is less than 0, which would have caused the loop to end immediately if the index was negative. However, by replacing it with `index > 0`, the loop will continue even if the index is negative, which could cause the code to access negative indices in the `ops` array, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code would have checked if the index is less than 0, which would have caused the loop to end immediately if the index was negative. However, by replacing it with `index <= 0`, the loop will continue even if the index is 0 or negative, which could cause the code to access negative indices in the `ops` array, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= 0
```
This would result in different
