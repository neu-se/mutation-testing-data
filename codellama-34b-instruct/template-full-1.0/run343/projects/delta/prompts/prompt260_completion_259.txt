  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.insert + otherOp.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate the `insert` properties of both objects, potentially creating a new string that is different from the original.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.delete - otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `delete` property of `otherOp` from the `delete` property of `thisOp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain - otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract the `retain` property of `otherOp` from the `retain` property of `thisOp`.

DONE.
