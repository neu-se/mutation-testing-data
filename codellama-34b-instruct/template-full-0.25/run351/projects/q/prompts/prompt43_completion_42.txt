  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay would be different, causing the `flush` function to be called after a different amount of time.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, "0"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay would be different, causing the `flush` function to be called after a different amount of time.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` delay would be different, causing the `flush` function to be called after a different amount of time.

DONE.
