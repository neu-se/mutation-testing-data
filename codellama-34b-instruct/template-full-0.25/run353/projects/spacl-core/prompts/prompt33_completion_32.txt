  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[0];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the last part of the path, rather than the first part as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the second-to-last part of the path, rather than the first part as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const part = spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()[Math.floor(Math.random() * spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse().length)];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would randomly select a part of the path, rather than always using the first part as in the original code.

DONE.
