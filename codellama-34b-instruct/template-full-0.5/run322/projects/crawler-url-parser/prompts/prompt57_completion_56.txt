  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which would not be affected by the replacement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/#.*$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which would not be affected by the replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^(?!(?:\w+:)?\/\/)/, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `URL.parse()` method to parse the URL, which would not be affected by the replacement.

DONE.
