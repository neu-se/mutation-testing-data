  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  addRule('goose', 'goose')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the original word instead of its plural form, which would contradict the rules set for the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  addRule('goose', 'geesee')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a word that is not the plural form of the original word, which would contradict the rules set for the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
  addRule('goose', function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a plural form of the word that is not the same as the original rule for the function, which would contradict the rules set for the function.

DONE.
