  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(new Error('Unknown expression'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would throw an error with a specific message, whereas the original code would simply exit the program without any message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + 'NaN');
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would add the string 'NaN' to the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code would add the result of the `parseFloat` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += Math.pow(tokens[i + 1], 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because the replaced code would add the square of the next token to the imaginary part of the complex number, whereas the original code would add the next token as is.

DONE.
