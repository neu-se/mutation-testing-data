  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a random number to the length of the op, which could cause the slice method to return an incorrect result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it doubles the length of the op, which could cause the slice method to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it subtracts a random number from the length of the op, which could cause the slice method to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
