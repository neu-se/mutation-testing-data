  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` value would be multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting offset value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be used instead of the `utcOffset` value, which could change the resulting offset value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
utcOffset + dstOffset
```
This would result in different behavior because the `utcOffset` and `dstOffset` values would be added together, which would change the resulting offset value.

DONE.
