  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisIter.peekType()` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, it would return `'delete'` instead of `'insert'`. This would cause the `compose` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peekType()` method returns the type of the next operation in the iterator, and in this case, it would return `'insert'` instead of `'delete'`. This would cause the `compose` method to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the
