  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with a specific message, while the modified code emits an error event with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, 10)}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the entire buffer, while the modified code emits an error event with only the first 10 characters of the buffer.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, 10)}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error event with the entire buffer,
