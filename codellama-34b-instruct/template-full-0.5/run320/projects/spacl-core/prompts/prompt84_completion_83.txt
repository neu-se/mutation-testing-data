  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` does not return a new array, whereas `map` does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` returns a boolean indicating whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `map` returns a new array containing the results of calling the provided function on every element.

DONE.
