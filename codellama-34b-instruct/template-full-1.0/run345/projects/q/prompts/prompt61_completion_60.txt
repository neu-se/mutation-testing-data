  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function expects a window object to be passed as its first argument, but passing `null` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function expects a window object to be passed as its first argument, but passing `undefined` would cause it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setImmediate` function expects a window object to be passed as its first argument, but passing `0` would cause it to throw an error.

DONE.
