  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.call` is a different method than `callback.apply`, and it would change the context of the function call.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.bind` returns a new function that is bound to the specified context, and it would change the context of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.toString` returns a string representation of the function, and it would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
