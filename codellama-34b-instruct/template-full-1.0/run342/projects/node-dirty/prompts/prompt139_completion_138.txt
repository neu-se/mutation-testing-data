  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the `cbs` array is empty and the error is not null, while the new code fragment checks whether the error is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the `cbs` array is empty and the error is not null, while the new code fragment checks whether the `cbs` array is empty regardless of the error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks whether the `cbs` array is empty and the error is not null, while the new code fragment always evaluates to `true`.
