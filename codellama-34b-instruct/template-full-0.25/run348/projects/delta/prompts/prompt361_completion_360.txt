  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would cause the `hasNext` method to not be called, resulting in a different evaluation of the while loop's condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the `hasNext` method of the `otherIter` iterator instead of the `thisIter` iterator, which could cause the loop to terminate at a different point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!thisIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be checking the negation of the `hasNext` method of the `thisIter` iterator, which could cause the loop to terminate at a different point.

DONE.
