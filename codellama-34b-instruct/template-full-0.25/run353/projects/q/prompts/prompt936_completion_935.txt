  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would include the first argument, which is the callback function, while `array_slice(arguments, 1)` would exclude it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would include the first two arguments, which are the callback function and the `thisp` argument, while `array_slice(arguments, 2)` would exclude them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because `array_slice(arguments)` would include the first three arguments, which are the callback function, the `thisp` argument, and the `args` argument, while `array_slice(arguments, 3)` would exclude them.

DONE.
