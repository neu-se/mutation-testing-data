 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * Math.sqrt
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces an unnecessary multiplication operation, which would not affect the result in this context.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.SQRT2` is a predefined constant with a value of approximately 1.414, while `Math.sqrt` is a function that calculates the square root of a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.exp(0.5 * Math.log(a * a + b * b))
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the square root using the logarithm identity `sqrt(x) = exp(0.5 * log(x))`, which is not equivalent to the original `Math.sqrt` function.

DONE.
