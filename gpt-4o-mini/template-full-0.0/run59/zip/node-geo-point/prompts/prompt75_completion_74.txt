Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 10 to the bearing value, which would change the calculated destination point, potentially leading to an incorrect location.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(bearing)
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the absolute value of the bearing, which could alter the direction of the destination point, especially if the original bearing was negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the bearing to 0, which would always calculate the destination point directly north of the original coordinate, regardless of the intended bearing.

DONE.
