  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be testing a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data.key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be testing a different key.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data.type)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be testing a different type.

DONE.
