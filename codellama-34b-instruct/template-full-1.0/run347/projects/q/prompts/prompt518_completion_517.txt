  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` is a different method than `deferred.reject`, and it will not cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is not a method, and it will not cause the promise to be fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject(reason)` is a method that creates a rejected promise with a specific reason, which is not the same as `deferred.reject`.

DONE.
