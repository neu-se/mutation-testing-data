  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be increased by 180 degrees, which would cause the calculated destination point to be offset by 180 degrees from the original point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be doubled, which would cause the calculated destination point to be twice as far from the original point as it should be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
bearing - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bearing` value would be decreased by 180 degrees, which would cause the calculated destination point to be offset by 180 degrees in the opposite direction from the original point.

DONE.
