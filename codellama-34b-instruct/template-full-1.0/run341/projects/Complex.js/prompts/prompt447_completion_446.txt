  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the imaginary part of the complex number instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * this['re']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the product of `places` and `this['re']` instead of just `this['re']`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the division of `this['re']` by `places` instead of their product.

DONE.
