  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'type'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `point` object has a property called `type`, while the buggy code fragment is checking if the `point` object has a property called `'type'`, which is a string literal instead of a variable. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `throw` statement to be executed, which would result in an error being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'coordinates'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if the `point` object has a property called `coordinates`, while the buggy code fragment is checking if the `point` object has a property called `'coordinates'`, which is a string literal instead of a variable. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` and the `throw` statement to be executed, which would result in an error being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be
