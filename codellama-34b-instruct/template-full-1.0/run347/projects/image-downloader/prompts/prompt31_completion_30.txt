  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('https') ? https : http;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `startsWith` method checks if the string starts with the specified substring, which in this case would be 'https'. If the string starts with 'https', the code would execute the `https` requests, but if it doesn't, it would execute the `http` request. By replacing the placeholder with a different buggy code fragment, such as `url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).includes('https') ? https : http;`, the code would still check if the string includes the substring 'https', but if it doesn't, it would still execute the `http` request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (!url.trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>).startsWith('https')) {
  reject(new Error('Invalid URL'));
  return;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `starts
