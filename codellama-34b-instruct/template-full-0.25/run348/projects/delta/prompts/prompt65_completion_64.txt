  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-null value, while this modified code fragment sets it to null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-string value, while this modified code fragment sets it to the string 'foo'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.insert = 42;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets `newOp.insert` to a non-number value, while this modified code fragment sets it to the number 42.

DONE.
