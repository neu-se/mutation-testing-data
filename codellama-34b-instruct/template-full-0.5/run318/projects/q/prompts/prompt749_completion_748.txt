  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be passed `null` instead of the expected value, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be passed `undefined` instead of the expected value, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `onFulfilled` function would be passed a string literal instead of the expected value, which could cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
