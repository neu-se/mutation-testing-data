  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, while `pop` removes the last element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` returns a new array containing all elements except the first, while `pop` removes the last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of an array, while `pop` removes the last element.

DONE.
