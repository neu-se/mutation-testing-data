  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` is a function that takes an error object as an argument, while `cb` is a callback function that takes an error object and a result object as arguments. Using `abort` instead of `cb` would cause the code to pass the error object to the `abort` function instead of the callback function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a special value that represents the absence of an object or a value, while `cb` is a callback function that is expected to be called with an error object and a result object. Using `null` instead of `cb` would cause the code to pass a `null` value to the `map` function, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return abort }
```
This would result in different behavior because `function
