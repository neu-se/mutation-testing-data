  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete >= lastOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `newOp` to be merged with the `lastOp` even if `newOp.delete` is greater than `lastOp.delete`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.delete === 'number' && lastOp.delete <= newOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the `newOp` to be merged with the `lastOp` if `lastOp.delete` is less than or equal to `newOp.delete`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newOp.delete > 0 && lastOp.delete > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow the `newOp` to be merged with the `lastOp` if both `newOp.delete` and `lastOp.delete` are greater than zero.

DONE.
