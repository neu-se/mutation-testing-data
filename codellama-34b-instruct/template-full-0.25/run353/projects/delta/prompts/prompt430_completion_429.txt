  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peekLength(this.offset)` would return a different value than `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` if `this.offset` is not equal to `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peekLength(this.index)` would return a different value than `this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>)` if `this.index` is not equal to `<PLACEHOLDER>`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(this.offset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.peekLength(this.offset + 1)` would return a different value than `this.peekLength(<
