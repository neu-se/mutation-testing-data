  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.slice()` would create a new array from `promises`, which would have a different internal state than the original array. The rest of the code would still be operating on the original array, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat()
```
This would result in different behavior because `.concat()` would return a new array with the elements of the original array and the additional elements provided as arguments. The rest of the code would still be operating on the original array, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(() => false)
```
This would result in different behavior because `.filter()` would create a new array with the elements that satisfy the predicate function. Since the predicate function always returns `false`, the new array would be empty, which would break the rest of the code because it relies on the original array being non-empty
