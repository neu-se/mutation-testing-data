  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string path, while `1 + 1` is a number. As a result, the method call `access` would receive different arguments and behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isEmpty(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` checks for readability and writability, while `isEmpty(src)` only checks if the source is empty. If the source is empty, the method call `access` may never be reached and the behavior of the code could be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` does not modify the string, while `src.length - 1` subtracts 1 from the string's length. As a result, the method call `access` may receive a different argument and behave differently
