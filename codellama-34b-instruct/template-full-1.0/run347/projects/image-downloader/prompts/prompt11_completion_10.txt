  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the provided path, whereas `path.basename` returns the base name (i.e., file name without extension).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.extname` returns the file extension of the provided path, whereas `path.basename` returns the base name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.parse(options.dest).base
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.parse(options.dest).base` returns the base name of the provided path (i.e., file name without extension or directory path), whereas `path.basename` returns the base name (i.e., file name without extension).

DONE.
