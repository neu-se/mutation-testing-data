  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different order of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0 || a > 0
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it uses a different order of operations and a different logical operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > 0 && b === 0 && 1 === 1
```
This code fragment is functionally equivalent to the original code fragment, but it includes an additional condition that is always true.

DONE.
