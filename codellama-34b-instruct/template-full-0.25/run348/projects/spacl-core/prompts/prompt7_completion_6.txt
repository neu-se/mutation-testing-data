  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains empty segments, while this replacement checks if the path does not contain empty segments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains empty segments, while this replacement checks if the path contains any segment that is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/\/\//) !== null && spec.match(/\/\//).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the path contains empty segments, while this replacement checks if the path contains any segment that is not null and has a length greater than 0.

DONE.
