  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a + b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `a` or `b` is undefined, but this replacement code fragment would throw an error if `a` and `b` are both undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a - b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `a` or `b` is undefined, but this replacement code fragment would throw an error if `a` and `b` are both undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parser_exit(a * b);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error if `a` or `b` is undefined, but this replacement code fragment would throw an error if `a` and `b` are both undefined.

DONE.
