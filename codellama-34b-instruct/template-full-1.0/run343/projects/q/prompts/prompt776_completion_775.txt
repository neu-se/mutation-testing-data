  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `any` would be resolved with a value of `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `any` would be resolved with a value of 0 instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise returned by `any` would be rejected with an error instead of being resolved with a value.

DONE.
