  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the load event would not be emitted in the original code, whereas the error event would be.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the load event would not be emitted in the original code, whereas the write_close event would be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the load event would not be emitted in the original code, whereas the read_close event would be.

DONE.
