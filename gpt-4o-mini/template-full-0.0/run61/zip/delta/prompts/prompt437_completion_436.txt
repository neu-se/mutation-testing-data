Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retOp.attributes = nextOp.attributes || {};
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign an empty object to `retOp.attributes` if `nextOp.attributes` is falsy (e.g., `undefined` or `null`), potentially leading to unexpected results when attributes are expected to be present.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retOp.attributes = nextOp.attributes.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the length of `nextOp.attributes` (if it is an array or string) to `retOp.attributes`, rather than the attributes themselves, which would change the structure of the returned operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retOp.attributes = nextOp.insert;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly assign the value of `nextOp.insert` to `retOp.attributes`, which is not semantically correct and would lead to loss of the original attributes information.

DONE.
