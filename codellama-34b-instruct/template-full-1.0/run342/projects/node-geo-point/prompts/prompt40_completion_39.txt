  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(point1Rad) * Math.sin(point2Rad);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a calculation error in the calculation of the bearing, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos(point1Rad) * Math.sin(point2Rad);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a calculation error in the calculation of the bearing, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(point.longitude - point1.longitude, point.latitude - point1.latitude);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would introduce a calculation error in the calculation of the bearing, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
