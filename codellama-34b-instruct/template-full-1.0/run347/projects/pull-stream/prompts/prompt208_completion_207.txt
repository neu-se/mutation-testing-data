  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `aborted` variable is a truthy value, and the `if` statement would execute the `else` block. However, if we replace `aborted` with `null`, the `if` statement would not execute the `else` block, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `aborted` variable is a truthy value, and the `if` statement would execute the `else` block. However, if we replace `aborted` with `undefined`, the `if` statement would not execute the `else` block, which could cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `aborted` variable is a truthy value, and the `if` statement would
