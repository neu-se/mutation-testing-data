  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `otherOp` would always be `1`, even if the length of the op is greater than 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `otherOp` would always be negative, even if the length of the op is positive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `otherOp` would always be one greater than the actual length of the op.

DONE.
