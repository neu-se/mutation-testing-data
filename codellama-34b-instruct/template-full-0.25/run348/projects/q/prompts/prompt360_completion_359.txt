  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!done
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `done`, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` was previously set to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator short-circuits the expression, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, even if `done` was previously set to `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
done || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator short-circuits the expression, so the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, even if `done` was previously set to `false`.

DONE.
