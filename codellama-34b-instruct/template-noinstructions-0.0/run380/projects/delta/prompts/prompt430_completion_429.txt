  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>) < Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `hasNext` method to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>) > Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `hasNext` method to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.peekLength(<PLACEHOLDER>) === Infinity;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength` method would return a different value, potentially causing the `hasNext` method to return a different result.

DONE.
