 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for 'insert' instead of checking if the rest of 'other' is just 'retain'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength() > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for a positive length instead of checking if there's a next operation in 'thisIter'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
delta.ops[delta.ops.length - 1] !== newOp
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for inequality instead of checking if the last operation in 'delta' is the same as 'newOp'.

DONE.
