  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise` object would be assigned a new property called `stack`, which would shadow the original `stack` property of the `error` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.__minimumStackCounter__
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be assigned a new property called `__minimumStackCounter__`, which would shadow the original `stack` property of the `error` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` object would be assigned a new property called `stack`, which would shadow the original `stack` property of the `error` object.

DONE.
