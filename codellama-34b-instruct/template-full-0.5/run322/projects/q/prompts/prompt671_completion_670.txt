  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" expects a `this` argument before the function arguments, while "apply" expects the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind", [void 0, args]
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" returns a bound function, while "apply" applies the function to the given arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply", [args, void 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are passed in the wrong order.

DONE.
