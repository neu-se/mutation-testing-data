  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' || err.code === 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks for both "ENOENT" and "EACCES" error codes, while the original code fragment only checks for "ENOENT".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code === 'ENOENT' && err.code !== 'EACCES'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks for both "ENOENT" and "EACCES" error codes, while the original code fragment only checks for "ENOENT".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err.code !== 'ENOENT'
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment checks for any error code other than "ENOENT", while the original code fragment only checks for "ENOENT".

DONE.
