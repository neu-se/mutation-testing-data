  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `void 0` is a no-op expression in JavaScript, meaning it does nothing. In the original code, `progress` is a function that is called as a callback, but with `void 0` replaced, the callback would not be called, resulting in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw Error()` would cause an error to be thrown, which would cause the promise to be rejected. In the original code, the promise is fulfilled if the callback is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a primitive value that is not a function, but is coercible to a function during the call to `Q.prototype.then`. The original code uses the identity function `progress` as the second argument to `Q.prototype.then`, meaning that the fulfilled
