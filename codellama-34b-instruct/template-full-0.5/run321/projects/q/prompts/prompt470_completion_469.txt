  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves when the original promise is resolved, but the `then` method does not return the original promise, so it would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves when the original promise is rejected, but the `catch` method does not return the original promise, so it would not be equivalent to the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.finally(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves when the original promise is either resolved or rejected, but the `finally` method does not return the original promise, so it would not be equivalent to the original code.

DONE.
