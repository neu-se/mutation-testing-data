  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `b` variable to be a non-object value, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `b` variable to be a null value, which would not be caught by the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the `b` variable to be an undefined value, which would not be caught by the original code.

DONE.
