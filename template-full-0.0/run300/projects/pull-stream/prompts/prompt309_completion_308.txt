  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the `test` function to always return `true`, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would always return `false`, regardless of the input to the `test` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| false` would always return `true`, regardless of the input to the `test` function.

DONE.
