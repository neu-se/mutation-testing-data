  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain` would always be `true`, whereas `otherOp.delete` would only be `true` if the operation was a delete operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `!otherOp.delete` would always be `false`, whereas `otherOp.delete` would only be `false` if the operation was not a delete operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain && otherOp.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp.retain && otherOp.delete` would only be `true` if the operation was a retain operation and a delete operation, whereas `otherOp.delete` would be `true` if the operation was a delete operation regardless of whether it was also a retain operation.

DONE.
