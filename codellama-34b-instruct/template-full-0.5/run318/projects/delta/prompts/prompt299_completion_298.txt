  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.length` would return the number of characters in the line, while `line` would return the line itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.strip()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.strip()` would return the line with leading and trailing whitespace removed, while `line` would return the line as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.upper()
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.upper()` would return the line in uppercase, while `line` would return the line as is.

DONE.
