  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(resolver, rejecter) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function expression that takes two arguments, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q([this, that]).spread(function (x, y) {
    if (x === y) {
        // TODO: "===" should be Object.is or equiv
        return x;
    } else {
        throw new Error("Q can't join: not the same: " + x + " " + y);
    }
})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to an array of `this` and `that`, which is not what the original code fragment does.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(x).join(y)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that resolves to `
