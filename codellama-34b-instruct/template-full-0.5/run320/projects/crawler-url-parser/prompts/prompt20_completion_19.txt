  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex makes the match case-insensitive, which could cause the function to return a different result than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex makes the match global, which could cause the function to return a different result than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^https?:\/\//
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex now matches both `http://` and `https://` protocols, which could cause the function to return a different result than expected.

DONE.
