  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delta` variable is used in the calculation of `sinφ2`, which is used to determine the latitude of the destination point. If `delta` is replaced with `0`, the latitude of the destination point will always be the same as the latitude of the source point, regardless of the distance and bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
π
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delta` variable is used in the calculation of `sinφ2`, which is used to determine the latitude of the destination point. If `delta` is replaced with π, the latitude of the destination point will be the opposite of the latitude of the source point, regardless of the distance and bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delta` variable is used in the calculation of `sinφ2`, which is used to determine the latitude of the destination point. If `delta
