  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` is a function call, whereas `thisIter.next` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` is a function call, whereas `thisIter.next` is a reference to the function itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a reference to the function itself, whereas `thisIter.next()` is a function call.

DONE.
