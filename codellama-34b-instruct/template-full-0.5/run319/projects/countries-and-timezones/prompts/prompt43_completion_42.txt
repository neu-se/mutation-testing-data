  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountry` function would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause it to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezone` function would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause it to return a different timezone than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountryForTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getCountryForTimezone` function would be called with the wrong arguments, which could cause it to return a different country than the one intended.

DONE.
