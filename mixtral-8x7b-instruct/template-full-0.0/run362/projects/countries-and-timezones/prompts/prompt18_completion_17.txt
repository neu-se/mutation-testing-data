 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result['country'].all.push(id);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always push the `id` to the `all` array of the string 'country' instead of the country stored in the `country` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries.push(result[country].all);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `all` array of the current country to the `countries` array, instead of pushing the `id` to the `all` array of the current country.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
result[country].all = result[country].all.concat(id);
