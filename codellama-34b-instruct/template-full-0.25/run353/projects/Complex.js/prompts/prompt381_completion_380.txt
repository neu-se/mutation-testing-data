  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `sinh` and `cosh` are related but distinct trigonometric functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `tanh` and `coth` are related but distinct trigonometric functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `asinh` and `acosh` are related but distinct trigonometric functions.

DONE.
