  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` prototype, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` prototype. This would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` prototype, while the buggy code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Q` prototype, bound to the `this` context. This would cause the code to behave differently, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a reference to the `dispatch` method of the `Promise` prototype, while the
