  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `set` method to always set the value of `key` to `val`, regardless of whether `val` is undefined or not. In the original code, if `val` is undefined, the key is deleted from the map.

DONE.
