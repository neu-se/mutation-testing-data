```
getTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` and `getCountry` are not interchangeable. While `getCountry` returns a country object, `getTimezone` returns a timezone object, and the `options` parameter is not used in `getTimezone`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `buildCountry` is a function that takes two arguments, `data` and `id`, while `getCountry` takes only one argument, `id`. The result of `buildCountry` call would be different from the result of `getCountry` call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deliverCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because `deliverCountry` is a function that takes two arguments, `country` and `options`, while `getCountry` takes only one argument, `id`. The result of `deliverCountry` call would be different from the result of
