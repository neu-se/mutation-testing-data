  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the value is Not-a-Number, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks if the value is finite, while `isInfinite` checks if the value is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isInfinite`, so if the value is infinite, the result would be `false`, and if the value is not infinite, the result would be `true`.

DONE.
