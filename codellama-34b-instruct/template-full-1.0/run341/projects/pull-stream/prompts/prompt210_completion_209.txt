  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb()
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is not called in the original code, and calling it would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is not called in the original code, and calling it with the `err` argument would cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abortCb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `abortCb` is a callback function that is not called in the original code, and calling it with `null` argument would cause the code to behave differently.

DONE.
