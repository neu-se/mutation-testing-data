  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return iter.peekLength();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the peeked operation, rather than the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return iter.peekLength() + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the peeked operation plus one, which would cause an off-by-one error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return iter.peekLength() - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the peeked operation minus one, which would also cause an off-by-one error.

DONE.
