  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the attributes object, rather than the attributes object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the keys in the attributes object, rather than the attributes object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the values in the attributes object, rather than the attributes object itself.

DONE.
