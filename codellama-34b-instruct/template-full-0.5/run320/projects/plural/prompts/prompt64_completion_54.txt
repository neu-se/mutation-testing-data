  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacterium'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'bacterium' is the singular form of the word, while 'bacteria' is the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria's'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'bacteria's' is not a valid word and would cause the plural function to return an incorrect result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'bacteria's'
```
This would result in different behavior because 'bacteria's' is not a valid word and would cause the plural function to return an incorrect result.

DONE.
