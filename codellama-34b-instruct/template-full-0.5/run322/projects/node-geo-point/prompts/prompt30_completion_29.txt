  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * Math.PI / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, while this code fragment multiplies the difference between the longitudes by `Math.PI / 180`, which is not the same conversion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(point2.longitude - point1.longitude) * 3.14159 / 180
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `deg2rad` function to convert the longitude values to radians, while this code fragment multiplies the difference between the longitudes by `3.14159 / 180`, which is not the same conversion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
