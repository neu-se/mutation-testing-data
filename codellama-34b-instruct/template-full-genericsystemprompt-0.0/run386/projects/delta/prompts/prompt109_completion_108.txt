  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `predicate` function with the `op` and `index` arguments, which would likely have a different effect than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!predicate(op, index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would negate the result of the `predicate` function, which could cause the `filter` method to return a different set of operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(op, index) && op.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only call the `predicate` function if the `op` object has an `attributes` property, which could cause the `filter` method to return a different set of operations.

DONE.
