  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would expect the `longitude` property to be present in the input object, but it would not be able to find it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would expect the `longitude` property to have a value of `1`, but it would actually have a value of `2`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude' + 'longitude'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fromObject` method would expect the `longitude` property to be a number, but it would actually be a string.

DONE.
