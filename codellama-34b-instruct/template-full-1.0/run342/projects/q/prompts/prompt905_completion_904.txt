  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with `null` instead of `nodeArgs`, which would cause the function to resolve immediately with a value of `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with an empty array instead of `nodeArgs`, which would cause the function to resolve immediately with a value of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `setTimeout` function would be called with a function that doesn't take any arguments instead of `nodeArgs`, which would cause the function to resolve immediately with a value of `undefined`.

DONE.
