  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `true`, even if the timezone is not deprecated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tzs[key].deprecated === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to `false`, even if the timezone is deprecated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tzs[key].deprecated && tzs[key].name !== 'UTC'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would filter out any deprecated timezones that are not named "UTC".

DONE.
