Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file &&!file.sourceMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it inverts the condition, so the code inside the if statement will only be executed when `file` exists but `file.sourceMap` does not, which is the opposite of the original behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
file && file.sourceMap!== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `file.sourceMap` is not null, whereas the original code checks if it is truthy, which would also be false for empty strings, zeros, and other falsy values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
!!file &&!!file.sourceMap
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the double bang operator (`!!`) to convert the values to booleans, which can lead to different results if `file` or `file.sourceMap` are objects or other complex values that have a different truthiness than their boolean equivalent.

DONE.
