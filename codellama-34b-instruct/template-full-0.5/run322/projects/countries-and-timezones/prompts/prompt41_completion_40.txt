  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` would return the previous value of the accumulator, while `prev + 1` would return the previous value plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` would return the previous value of the accumulator, while `prev - 1` would return the previous value minus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prev` would return the previous value of the accumulator, while `prev * 2` would return the previous value multiplied by two.

DONE.
