  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses parseFloat to convert a string to a number, while this code fragment would concatenate a string and a number, resulting in a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.parseInt(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses parseFloat to convert a string to a number, while this code fragment would convert the string to an integer, resulting in a different number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.abs(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses parseFloat to convert a string to a number, while this code fragment would divide 1 by the absolute value of the number, resulting in a different number.

DONE.
