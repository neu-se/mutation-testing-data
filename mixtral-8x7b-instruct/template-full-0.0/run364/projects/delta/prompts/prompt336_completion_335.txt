 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
op.retain !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider any `op` with a falsy `retain` value (e.g., `0`, `''`, `null`, or `false`) as not an object, even though it might be an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `op` with a `retain` property that is a function as an object, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Array.isArray(op.retain)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider `op` with a `retain` property that is an array as an object, which is not the intended behavior.

DONE.
