  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.splice(at, 1)` would not be executed, resulting in the list of unhandled reasons not being updated correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.splice(at, at)` would remove the last item in the list of unhandled reasons, resulting in the wrong reason being removed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(unhandledReasons.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because `unhandledReasons.splice(at, Math.ceil(unhandledReasons.length / 2))` would remove half of the items in the list of unhandled reasons, resulting in a different list of unhandled reasons being retained.

DONE.
