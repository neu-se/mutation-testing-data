 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort behavior would not be triggered when `abort` is true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value
```
This would result in different behavior because the value would be passed to the abort callback instead of the original abort value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the onAbort function would be passed to the abort callback instead of the original abort value.

DONE.
