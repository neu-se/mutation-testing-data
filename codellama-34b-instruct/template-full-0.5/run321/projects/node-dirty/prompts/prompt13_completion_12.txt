  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cbs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called when the data is persisted. However, this new code fragment `!cbs.length` is a boolean expression that checks if the length of the `cbs` array is zero. If the length is zero, then the `cbs` array is empty, and the function will not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function that is called when the data is persisted. However, this new code fragment `cbs.length === 0` is a boolean expression that checks if the length of the `cbs` array is equal to zero. If the length is equal to zero, then the `cbs` array is empty, and the function will not be called.
