  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(thisOp.attributes, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.diff` function to receive `null` as the second argument, which would likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(otherOp.attributes, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.diff` function to receive `null` as the first argument, which would likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(otherOp.attributes[0], thisOp.attributes)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `AttributeMap.diff` function to receive a different set of attributes as its arguments, which could lead to a different comparison result.

DONE.
