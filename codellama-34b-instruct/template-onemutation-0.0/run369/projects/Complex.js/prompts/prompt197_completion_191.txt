  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `z['re']` to access the real part of the complex number, while the replaced code fragment uses `z['im']` to access the imaginary part. This would cause the resulting complex number to have a different real and imaginary part, leading to different behavior.

DONE.
