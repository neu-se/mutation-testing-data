Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` at the end of the word is not matched.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/ics$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` at the end of the word is not matched.
