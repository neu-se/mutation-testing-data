  Sure, here are my three answers:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        transformedData = Math.sqrt(otherData);
```
This would result in different behavior because while the original code fragment calculates the length of the text inserted by the user, the suggested replacement calculates the square root of that length. The resulting `transformedData` value would be a different number, potentially causing the text to be displayed at a different size or with different styling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        transformedData = otherData * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because while the original code fragment calculates the length of the text inserted by the user, the suggested replacement multiplies that length by 2. The resulting `transformedData` value would be twice as large as the original value, potentially causing the text to be displayed at a larger size or with different styling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
        transformedData = otherData - 1;
```
This would result in
