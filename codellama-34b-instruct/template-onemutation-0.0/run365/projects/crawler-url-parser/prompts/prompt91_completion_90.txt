  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^(javascript|mailto:|ftp:|file:)/ig.test
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now includes the "file:" protocol, which was not present in the original code fragment. This would cause the regular expression to match URLs that start with "file:", which may not have been intended.
