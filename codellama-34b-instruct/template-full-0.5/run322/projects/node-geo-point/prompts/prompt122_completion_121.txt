  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.calculateDistance(point.calculateDestination(distance, bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the original point and the destination point, rather than the distance between the original point and the point being passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.calculateDistance(this.calculateDestination(distance, bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the distance between the point being passed in and the destination point, rather than the distance between the original point and the point being passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.calculateBearing(point.calculateDestination(distance, bearing))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would calculate the bearing between the original point and the destination point, rather than the bearing between the original point and the point being passed in.

DONE.
