Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to treat the operation as a delete instead of an insert, potentially leading to incorrect transformations when merging two Deltas.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly prioritize retaining operations over insert operations, which could lead to unexpected results when applying transformations between two Deltas.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'insert' + 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a syntax error, as the expression is invalid, which would prevent the code from executing properly and could lead to runtime failures.

DONE.
