  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an object, but `null` would be a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an object, but `undefined` would also be a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is expecting an object, but `{}` is an empty object, which would not have the same properties or methods as the original object.

DONE.
