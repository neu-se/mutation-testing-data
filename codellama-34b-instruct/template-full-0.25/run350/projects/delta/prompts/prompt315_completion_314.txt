  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.length` is a method that returns the length of the `op` object, whereas `Op.length(op)` is a function that returns the length of the `op` object's `insert` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.insert.length` is a property that returns the length of the `insert` property of the `op` object, whereas `Op.length(op)` is a function that returns the length of the `op` object's `insert` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `op.retain.length` is a property that returns the length of the `retain` property of the `op` object, whereas `Op.length(op)` is a function that returns the length of
