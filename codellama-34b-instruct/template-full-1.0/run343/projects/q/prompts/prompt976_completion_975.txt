  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and `args || []` is an expression that returns an empty array if `args` is falsy, but `undefined` is not considered a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and `args || []` is an expression that returns an empty array if `args` is falsy, but `null` is not considered a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because `[]` is an empty array and `args || []` is an expression that returns an empty array if `args` is falsy, but an empty array is not considered a falsy value.

DONE.
