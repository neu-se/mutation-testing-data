  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr'
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL is being hardcoded.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the base URL is being parsed again.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(currentUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because the current URL is being parsed instead of the base URL.

DONE.
