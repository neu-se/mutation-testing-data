  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop` method takes an optional argument that specifies the number of characters to chop from the end of the delta, and passing `1` would cause the last character to be removed, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `2` to the `chop` method would cause the last two characters to be removed, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.chop(3)
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `3` to the `chop` method would cause the last three characters to be removed, which could potentially change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
