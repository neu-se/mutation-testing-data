  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` module instead of the `https` module, which could cause issues with secure connections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'https:'
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `https` module, but the `https:` protocol would be used instead of the `https` protocol, which could cause issues with secure connections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'http:'

This would result in different behavior because the code would always use the `http` module, but the `http:` protocol would be used instead of the `http` protocol, which could cause issues with secure connections.

DONE.
