  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new no-op function that would always return undefined, whereas the original `progress` method would have been called if it existed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the Q promise object instead of the desired progress function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Q.progress() is not a function")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error if the Q.progress() method was called, whereas the original code would have called it if it existed.

DONE.
