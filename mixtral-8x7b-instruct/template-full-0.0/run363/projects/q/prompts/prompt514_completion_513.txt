 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred object's resolve function would be called immediately, instead of waiting for the promise returned by `promise.then` to resolve. This could cause issues if the rest of the code expects the deferred object's resolve function to be called asynchronously.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object, but not necessarily initialize it properly. The `defer` function is called without any arguments, which could cause issues if the rest of the code expects the deferred object to be initialized with a resolve and reject function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{ resolve: function() {}, reject: function() {} }
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an object with `resolve` and `reject` functions, but does not actually do anything when those functions are called
