 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to the 'load' event handler is now 1 instead of 0, indicating that there is potentially data in the database even if it's empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'empty', 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name has been changed to 'empty', which might not be handled by any of the existing event listeners, causing the event to go unnoticed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', this._data.size
```
This would result in different behavior because the value passed to the 'load' event handler is now the actual size of the `_data` Map, which might not be accurate if the database is being loaded for the first time and there is no data yet.

DONE.
