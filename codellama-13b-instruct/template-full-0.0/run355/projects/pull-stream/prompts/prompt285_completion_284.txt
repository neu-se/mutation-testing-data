  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function `cb` with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with the argument `null` and the value of the `data` variable. This would cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment simply calls the callback function `cb` with no arguments, while this code fragment calls the callback function `cb` with the value of the `data` variable. This would cause the `map` function to return a different value than the original code, which could potentially cause issues in the code that uses the `map` function.
