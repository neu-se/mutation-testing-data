  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the queue of callbacks instead of the data stored in the database.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the values of the data stored in the database, rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.entries()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate over the entries (key-value pairs) of the data stored in the database, rather than just the keys.

DONE.
