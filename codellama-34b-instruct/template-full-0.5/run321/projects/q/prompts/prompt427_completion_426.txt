  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `isPromise`, so if `isPromise` is true, `!isPromise` would be false, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` checks if the object is a promise-like object, which means it has a `then` method, but it may not be a true promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFulfilled` checks if the object is a fulfilled promise, but it may not be a promise at all.

DONE.
