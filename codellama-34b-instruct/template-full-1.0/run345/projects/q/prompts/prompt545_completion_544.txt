  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(arg)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` method will return a promise that is rejected with the provided argument, whereas the `generator[verb]` method would attempt to execute a method called `verb` on the `generator` object with the provided argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be returned, whereas the `generator[verb]` method would attempt to execute a method called `verb` on the `generator` object with the provided argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw arg
```
This would result in different behavior because the `throw` statement would throw an error with the provided argument, whereas the `generator[verb]` method would attempt to execute a method called `verb` on the `generator` object with the provided argument.

DONE.
