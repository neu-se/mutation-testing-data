  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const key = 'foo';
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `in` operator to check if `key` is a property of `a`, but the new code fragment assigns the value `'foo'` to `key` and then checks if `'foo'` is a property of `a`, which is always false.

DONE.
