  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `object` parameter to be passed as the second argument to `Q.nsend`, but with `1` as the placeholder, the `object` parameter is skipped and the actual Node-style callback function is passed as the second argument instead, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foobar"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `object` parameter to be passed as the second argument to `Q.nsend`, but with `"foobar"` as the placeholder, a string value is passed as the second argument instead, which could cause the function to fail or produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `object` parameter to be passed as the second argument to `Q.nsend`, but with `undefined` as the placeholder
