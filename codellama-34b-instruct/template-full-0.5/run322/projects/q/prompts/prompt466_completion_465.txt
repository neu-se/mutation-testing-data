  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would always return -1, indicating that the value is not present in the array, even if it is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would always return 0, indicating that the value is present at the first index of the array, even if it is not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport === array_length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_indexOf` function would always return the index of the last element in the array, even if the value is not present.

DONE.
