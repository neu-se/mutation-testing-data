Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the distance to the origin (0, 0) instead of the intended destination point, leading to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the entire `GeoPoint` object instead of the specific `point` parameter, which could lead to unexpected results in the distance calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(this.latitude + 1, this.longitude + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always calculate the distance to a point that is offset by (1, 1) from the current point, rather than the actual target point, resulting in incorrect distance measurements.

DONE.
