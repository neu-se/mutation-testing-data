  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function with a null argument, which would cause the function to return without memoizing any timezone.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function with an undefined argument, which would cause the function to return without memoizing any timezone.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function with the timezone object that was already created, which would cause the function to return without memoizing any timezone.

DONE.
