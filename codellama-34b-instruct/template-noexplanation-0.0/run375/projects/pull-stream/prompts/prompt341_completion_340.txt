  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = true
```
This change will cause the `seen` object to always be updated, regardless of whether the `key` is already present or not. This will result in the `unique` function always returning `true`, even if the input data is not unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = false
```
This change will cause the `seen` object to always be updated, regardless of whether the `key` is already present or not. This will result in the `unique` function always returning `false`, even if the input data is unique.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
seen[key] = !seen[key]
```
This change will cause the `seen` object to be updated only if the `key` is not already present. This will result in the `unique` function returning `true` if the input data is unique, and `false` if it is not.

DONE.
