  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would no longer store the value passed to it, and the cache would become out of sync with the on-disk data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would no longer store the value passed to it, and the cache would become out of sync with the on-disk data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method would store the value `0` instead of the value passed to it, and the cache would become out of sync with the on-disk data.

DONE.
