Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `str` means that the content being written to the file will be `null`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when the file is read back.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str + 'extra data', options
```
This would result in different behavior because appending 'extra data' to `str` changes the content that is written to the file, potentially corrupting the JSON format and causing errors when the file is read.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, { ...options, encoding: 'utf8' }
```
This would result in different behavior because modifying the `options` object to enforce a specific encoding (like 'utf8') may override any other encoding specified in the original `options`, leading to potential data loss or corruption if the original data was in a different encoding.

DONE.
