  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!resolvedPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the boolean value of `resolvedPromise`, so if `resolvedPromise` is truthy, `!resolvedPromise` would be falsy, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `resolvedPromise` is not strictly equal to `true`, the condition would evaluate to `false`, even if `resolvedPromise` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `resolvedPromise` is strictly equal to `false`, the condition would evaluate to `true`, even if `resolvedPromise` is falsy.
