  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `deferred.resolve(promises)` line to be executed even if there are still pending promises, which would lead to a premature resolution of the promise returned by `all`.

DONE.
