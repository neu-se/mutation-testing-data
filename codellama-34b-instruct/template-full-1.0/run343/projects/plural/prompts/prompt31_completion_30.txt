  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is slicing the string from the first character until the second-to-last character, while this new code fragment is slicing the string from the first character until the last character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(1, w.length - 2) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is slicing the string from the first character until the second-to-last character, while this new code fragment is slicing the string from the second character until the second-to-last character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior
