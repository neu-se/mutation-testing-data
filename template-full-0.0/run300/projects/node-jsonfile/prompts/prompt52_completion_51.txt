  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj + {}
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj + {}` would return a new object with the properties of `obj`, whereas `obj` would return the original object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` would return a string representation of the object, whereas `obj` would return the original object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.hasOwnProperty('key')
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.hasOwnProperty('key')` would return a boolean indicating whether the object has a property named 'key', whereas `obj` would return the original object.

DONE.
