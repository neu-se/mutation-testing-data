  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment is using the unary negation operator, which changes the sign of a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment is using the identity function, which returns the input value unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was using the `Math.exp` function, which computes the exponential value of a number, while the replacement code fragment is using the addition operator, which adds 1 to the input value.

DONE.
