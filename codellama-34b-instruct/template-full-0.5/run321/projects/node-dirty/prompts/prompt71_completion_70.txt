  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value `0` is emitted as an error, while with the modified code, the value `1` is emitted as an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value `0` is emitted as an error, while with the modified code, the string `"error"` is emitted as an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the value `0` is emitted as an error, while with the modified code, an error object is emitted.

DONE.
