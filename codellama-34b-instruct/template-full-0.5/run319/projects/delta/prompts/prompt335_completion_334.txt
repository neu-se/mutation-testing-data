  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, other.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other Delta instead of the base Delta, which could lead to incorrect results in the inverted Delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes, thisOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the current op instead of the base Delta, which could lead to incorrect results in the inverted Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
other.attributes, baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the attributes of the other Delta and the base Delta instead of the current op and the base Delta, which could lead to incorrect results in the inverted Delta.

DONE.
