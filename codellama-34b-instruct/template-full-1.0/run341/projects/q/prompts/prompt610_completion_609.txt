  Option 1:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Q(object).get("dispatch");
```

This would result in different behavior because the `get` method returns a copy of the property's value, rather than the property itself. In this case, the `dispatch` method is called on the returned value, which may not have the same behavior as calling it on the `object` directly.

Option 2:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Q(object).resolve("dispatch");
```

This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` method resolves the promise with the given value, rather than returning the value of the property. In this case, the `dispatch` method is not called at all.

Option 3:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

```
Q(object).bind("dispatch");
```

This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` set to the provided value, and the `dispatch` method is not
