  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [undefined, []];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over an empty array, instead of the expected array of callback functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [null, []];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over an array with a single element (the `null` value), instead of the expected array of callback functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = [Symbol(), []];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over an array with a single element (the `Symbol` value), instead of the expected array of callback functions.

DONE.
