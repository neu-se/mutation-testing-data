  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next op from the `thisIter` iterator to the `delta` array, which would cause the `delta` array to contain the same ops as the `thisIter` iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next op from the `otherIter` iterator to the `delta` array, which would cause the `delta` array to contain the same ops as the `otherIter` iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next(length));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next `length` ops from the `thisIter` iterator to the `delta` array, which would cause the `delta` array to contain a subset of the ops from the `thisIter` iterator.
