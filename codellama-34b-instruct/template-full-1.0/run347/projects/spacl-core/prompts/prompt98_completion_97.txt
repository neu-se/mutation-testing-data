  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name.toUpperCase())
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.toUpperCase()` would return a different value than `name`, which could potentially match a different key in the `PolicyMap` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name.substr(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.substr(1)` would return a different value than `name`, which could potentially match a different key in the `PolicyMap` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because `name.slice(1)` would return a different value than `name`, which could potentially match a different key in the `PolicyMap` object.

DONE.
