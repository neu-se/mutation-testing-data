  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This change would cause the `access` method to check if the target file path has both read and write permissions, rather than just read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK ^ fs.constants.W_OK
```
This change would cause the `access` method to check if the target file path has either read or write permissions, but not both.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This change would cause the `access` method to check if the target file path has read, write, or execute permissions.

DONE.
