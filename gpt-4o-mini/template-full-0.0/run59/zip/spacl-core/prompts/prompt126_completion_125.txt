Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed even if `ctx` is explicitly set to `null`, which is not the same as being `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
count === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly allow the function to return `false` when there are no properties to match, rather than checking if `ctx` is `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx !== undefined && ctx !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would require `ctx` to be neither `undefined` nor `null` for the function to return `false`, which is stricter than the original condition.

DONE.
