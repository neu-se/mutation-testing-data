  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called, and the promise would be resolved with the value `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called, and the promise would be resolved with the value `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would be called with a new `Error` object, and the promise would be rejected with that error.

DONE.
