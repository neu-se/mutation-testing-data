  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, instead of the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second element of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getFileNameAndLineNumber.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the length of the array returned by `getFileNameAndLineNumber`, instead of the entire array.

DONE.
