  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` would delete the contents of the delta, whereas `delta.push` would add a new operation to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.retain(0)` would retain 0 characters, whereas `delta.push` would add a new operation to the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.insert(0)` would insert a new operation at the beginning of the delta, whereas `delta.push` would add a new operation to the end of the delta.

DONE.
