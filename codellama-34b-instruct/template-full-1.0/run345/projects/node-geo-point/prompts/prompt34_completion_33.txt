  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant that represents Pi (Ï€), which is a fundamental constant in mathematics. Using `Math.PI` instead of `cos` would cause the resulting value to be a completely different angle, leading to very different behavior in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.E
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.E` is a constant that represents Euler's number (e), which is approximately 2.718. Using `Math.E` instead of `cos` would also cause the resulting value to be a completely different angle, leading to very different behavior in the `calculateDistance` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.SQRT2
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.SQRT2` is a constant that represents the square root of 2, which is approximately
