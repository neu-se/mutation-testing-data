  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator changes the sign of the result, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` returns the sine of the argument, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.abs
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator `/` changes the result, while `Math.abs` returns the absolute value.

DONE.
