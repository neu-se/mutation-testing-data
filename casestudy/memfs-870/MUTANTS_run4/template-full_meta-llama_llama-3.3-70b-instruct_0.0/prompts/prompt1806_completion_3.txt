Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'w'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for writing instead of reading, potentially causing issues with file permissions and data integrity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for appending instead of reading, which could lead to unexpected file modifications and errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename, 'r+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the file would be opened for both reading and writing, which could cause issues with file locking and data corruption if not handled properly.

DONE.
