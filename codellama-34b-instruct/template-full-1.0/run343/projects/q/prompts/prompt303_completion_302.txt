  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > answerPs.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would never execute, since the condition is always false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < answerPs.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
answerPs.length <= i
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute once more than the number of elements in the array, causing an error.

DONE.
