  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl) + 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` would return a different value, causing the `type` property of the `currentUrl` object to be set to an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl) * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` would return a different value, causing the `type` property of the `currentUrl` object to be set to an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
gettype(linkurl, pageurl) / 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `gettype` would return a different value, causing the `type` property of the `currentUrl` object to be set to an incorrect value.

DONE.
