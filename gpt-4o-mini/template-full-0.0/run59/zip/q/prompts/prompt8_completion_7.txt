Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"invalid_argument"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function to be passed as an argument, while this string would likely cause errors or unexpected behavior when the module is used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of a function would lead to runtime errors when the code attempts to invoke the expected function, as it would not be callable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return "test"; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a specific function that adheres to the Q API, while this simple function would not fulfill the expected contract, potentially leading to incorrect behavior in promise handling.

DONE.
