  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isObject
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is an object, while the buggy code fragment checks if the value is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFunction
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is an object, while the buggy code fragment checks if the value is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isArray
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the value is an object, while the buggy code fragment checks if the value is an array.

DONE.
