Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.host
```
This would result in different behavior because it compares the host of the link URL instead of the entire link URL object, potentially leading to incorrect type classification when the host matches but other properties differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would compare the link URL against the entire page URL object instead of just the link URL, which could lead to incorrect type classifications based on the page URL's properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl.path + linkurl.subdomain
```
This would result in different behavior because it combines the path and subdomain of the link URL, which may not accurately reflect the intended comparison logic, potentially leading to incorrect type classifications based on an unintended combination of properties.

DONE.
