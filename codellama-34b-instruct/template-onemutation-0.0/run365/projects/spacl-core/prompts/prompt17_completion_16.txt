  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const { regex, props } = compile(spec)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compile` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The `compile` function expects a string as its first argument, but `spec` is an instance of the `Matcher` class.

DONE.
