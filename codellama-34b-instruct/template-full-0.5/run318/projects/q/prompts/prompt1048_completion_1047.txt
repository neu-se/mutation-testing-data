  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` is a method that resolves a promise, whereas `Q.reject` is a method that rejects a promise. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to handle errors, so replacing it with `Q.resolve` would cause the code to behave differently when errors occur.

```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` is a method that rejects a promise with a specified reason, whereas `Q.resolve` is a method that resolves a promise. In the original code, `Q.reject` is used to handle errors, so replacing it with `Q.reject("error")` would cause the code to behave differently when errors occur.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(error)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.
