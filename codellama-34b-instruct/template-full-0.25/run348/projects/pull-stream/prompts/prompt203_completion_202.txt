  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `data` if `end` is truthy, and `end` otherwise. This would cause the `map` function to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end || data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a lower precedence than the `end` variable, so the expression would evaluate to `end` if it is truthy, and `data` otherwise. This would cause the `map` function to be called with a different argument than the original code, which could result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end ? data : null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?` operator has a higher precedence than the `end` variable
