  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'wrong_dest' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to a different value than the original code fragment, which would cause the file to be written to a different location than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: null }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filename` property is set to `null`, which would cause the file to be written to the current working directory instead of the specified destination.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ filename: 'dest', mode: 'w' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `mode` property is set to `'w'` instead of the default `'a'`, which would cause the file to be overwritten instead of appended to.

DONE.
