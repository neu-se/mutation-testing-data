Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1.latitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the latitude of the first point instead of the second point, which would lead to incorrect bearing calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + 90
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 90 degrees to the longitude of the second point, which would skew the bearing calculation significantly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.latitude + 100
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 100 to the latitude of the second point, which is an invalid operation since latitude values should be within the range of -90 to 90 degrees, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

DONE.
