  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the expression is changed, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1.0 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression is multiplied by 1, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return the same value as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2.0 * (r - b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable used in the expression is changed, which would cause the `sqrt` function to return a different value.

DONE.
