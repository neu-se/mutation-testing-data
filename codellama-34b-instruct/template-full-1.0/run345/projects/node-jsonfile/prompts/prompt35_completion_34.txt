  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `console.log()` function logs the input value to the console, while the original code fragment `str` simply evaluates to a string value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `0` constant is evaluated to a number value, while the original code fragment `str` evaluates to a string value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` keyword is a null value, while the original code fragment `str` evaluates to a string value.

DONE.
