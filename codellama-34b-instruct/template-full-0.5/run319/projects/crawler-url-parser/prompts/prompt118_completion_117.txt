  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to receive a `linkurl` object instead of a `currentUrl` object, which would lead to a different evaluation of the `linkurl.subdomain` and `linkurl.path` properties, and therefore a different return value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to receive a `pageurl` object instead of a `currentUrl` object, which would lead to a different evaluation of the `pageurl.subdomain` and `pageurl.path` properties, and therefore a different return value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `gettype` function to receive a `baseUrl` object instead of a `currentUrl` object, which would lead to a different evaluation of the `baseUrl.
