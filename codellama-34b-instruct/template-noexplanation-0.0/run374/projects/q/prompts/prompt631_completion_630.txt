  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "d"
```
This code fragment will concatenate the string "delete" with the string "d", resulting in the string "deleted". This change will cause the `Q.del` method to dispatch the "deleted" operation instead of the "delete" operation, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + 1

This code fragment will concatenate the string "delete" with the number 1, resulting in the string "delete1". This change will cause the `Q.del` method to dispatch the "delete1" operation instead of the "delete" operation, which may have unintended consequences.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "e"
```
This code fragment will concatenate the string "delete" with the string "e", resulting in the string "dele". This change will cause the `Q.del` method to dispatch the "dele
