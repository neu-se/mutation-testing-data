  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.reject(rejection)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `rejection` error, instead of being resolved with the fulfillment value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.resolve(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the `promise` object, instead of being resolved with the fulfillment value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
when.race(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the fulfillment value of the first promise in the array, instead of being resolved with the fulfillment value of the `promise` object.

DONE.
