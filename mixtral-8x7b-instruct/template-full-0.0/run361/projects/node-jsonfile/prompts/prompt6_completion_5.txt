 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `fs` module instead of the universalify wrapper, which may not handle different environments (like browser or node) consistently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
() => fs.readFile(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new function that directly uses the `fs` module, which may not handle different environments (like browser or node) consistently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
universalify.fromCallback(fs.readFile)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the synchronous version of the `universalify.fromCallback` function, which may not handle errors or callbacks correctly in an asynchronous context.

DONE.
