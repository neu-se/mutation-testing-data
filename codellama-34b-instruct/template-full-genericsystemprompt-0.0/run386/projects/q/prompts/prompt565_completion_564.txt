  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an exception if `exception` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an exception if `exception` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would throw an exception if `exception` is not defined, while the new code fragment would simply return the string "error".

DONE.
