  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of `//` in the string, rather than just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of `//` in the string, regardless of case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\//m
```
This would result in different behavior because the `m` flag at the end of the regex would cause the regex to match all occurrences of `//` in the string, even if they are on different lines.

DONE.
