Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').attr('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because it explicitly retrieves the `href` attribute from the `<base>` tag, which may not exist, leading to a potential `undefined` value instead of the intended behavior of retrieving the `href` attribute from the `<base>` tag if it exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').prop('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.prop()` method retrieves the property value directly from the DOM element, which may differ from the attribute value, especially if the `<base>` tag has been modified dynamically, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('base').data('href')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.data()` method retrieves data attributes set on the element, which may not correspond to the actual `href` attribute, leading to a situation where the expected URL is not retrieved at all.

DONE.
