Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(regardless, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the second argument of the `then` method to `null`, which means that any rejection of the promise will not be handled, potentially leading to unhandled promise rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(null, regardless)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument of the `then` method to `null`, which means that any fulfillment of the promise will not be handled, and the `regardless` function will only be called if the promise is rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.catch(regardless)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `catch` method instead of `then`, which means that the `regardless` function will only be invoked for rejections, and it will not be called for fulfilled promises, altering the intended behavior of handling both fulfillment and rejection.

DONE.
