  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `object.inspect().state` which would return the state of the object as a string, while the new code uses `promise.inspect().state` which would return the state of the promise as a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().value === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `object.inspect().state` which would return the state of the object as a string, while the new code uses `promise.inspect().value` which would return the value of the promise as a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.inspect().state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `object.inspect().state` which would return the state of the object as a string
