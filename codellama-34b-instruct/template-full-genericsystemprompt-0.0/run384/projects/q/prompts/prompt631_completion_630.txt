  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "set" operation would be performed instead of the "delete" operation, which would cause the property to be set to a new value instead of being deleted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "get" operation would be performed instead of the "delete" operation, which would cause the property to be retrieved instead of being deleted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the "post" operation would be performed instead of the "delete" operation, which would cause the property to be set to a new value instead of being deleted.

DONE.
