  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the arctangent of `b/a`, but adding `Math.PI` would shift the result by 180 degrees, causing the complex number's argument to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the arctangent of `a/b`, but the arguments are swapped, causing the complex number's argument to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.atan2` function returns the arctangent of `b/a`, but multiplying by 2 would cause the complex number's argument to be twice as large,
