  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `args` variable to be assigned the wrong value, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the `mapply` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `args` variable to be assigned the wrong value, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the `mcall` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `args` variable to be assigned the wrong value, which would lead to incorrect behavior in the `invoke` function.

DONE.
