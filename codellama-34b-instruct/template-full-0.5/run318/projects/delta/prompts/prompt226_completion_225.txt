  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would terminate early if the length of the current line is non-positive, potentially missing some operations that should have been applied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would terminate early if the length of the current line is negative, potentially missing some operations that should have been applied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would only terminate if the length of the current line is exactly 0, potentially missing some operations that should have been applied if the length is non-zero.

DONE.
