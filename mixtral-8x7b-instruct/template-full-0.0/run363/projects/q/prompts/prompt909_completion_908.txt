 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.denodeify.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the number of arguments passed to the `Q.denodeify.apply` method, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the `thisp` argument to `null` in the `Q.nbind` method, which might cause issues if the method being bound expects a specific object context.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return callback.apply(thisp, arguments); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps the `callback.apply` method with a function, which might cause issues with variable scoping or closure.

DONE.
