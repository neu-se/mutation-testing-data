  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.lengt
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.lengt` is undefined, whereas `buffer.length` returns the length of the buffer.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._waitForDrain
```
This would result in different behavior because `this._waitForDrain` is a boolean, whereas `buffer.length` returns a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because `buffer.lengt` is undefined, whereas `buffer.length` returns the length of the buffer.

DONE.
