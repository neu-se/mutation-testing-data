  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, while `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file, while `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync(file, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync(file, options)` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file, while `fs.readFile(file, options)` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

DONE.
