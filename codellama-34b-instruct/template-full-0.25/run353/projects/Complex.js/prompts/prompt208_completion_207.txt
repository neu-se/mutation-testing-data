  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(b, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments are swapped, which would cause the function to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is being called with the arguments swapped, and then adding PI to the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b) - Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the function is being called with the arguments swapped, and then subtracting PI from the result.

DONE.
