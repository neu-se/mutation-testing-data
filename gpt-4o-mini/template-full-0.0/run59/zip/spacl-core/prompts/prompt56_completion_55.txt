Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it transforms the `part` string to uppercase, which would change the regex pattern generated, potentially causing it to not match the intended paths.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the characters in the `part` string, leading to a regex pattern that does not correspond to the original path specification.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part.concat('extra')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends the string 'extra' to the `part`, altering the regex pattern and likely causing it to fail to match valid paths that were previously matched.

DONE.
