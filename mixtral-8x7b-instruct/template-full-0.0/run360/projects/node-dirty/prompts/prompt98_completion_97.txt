 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'error' event would not be emitted when there is a problem loading or writing to the database, but instead a 'warn' event would be emitted. This could cause issues to go unnoticed or be handled improperly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'customError'
