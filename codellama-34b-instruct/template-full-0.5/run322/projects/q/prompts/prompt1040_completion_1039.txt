  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a promise, but `Q.defer` is a function that creates a deferred object. Using `Q.defer()` would cause the `put` method to return a promise instead of a deferred object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer().promise` returns a promise that is resolved with the value of the deferred object, but `Q.defer` is a function that creates a deferred object. Using `Q.defer().promise` would cause the `put` method to return a promise that is resolved with the value of the deferred object, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the `get` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
