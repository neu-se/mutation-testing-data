Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(this['im'] * places) / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round down the imaginary part instead of rounding up, potentially leading to different complex number representations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round(this['im'] * places) / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would round the imaginary part to the nearest integer instead of always rounding up, which could change the value of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil(this['im'] * places + 1) / places
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the imaginary part before applying the ceiling function, effectively increasing the result and altering the complex number representation.

DONE.
