  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, num
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would receive `null` as the first argument, which would cause it to return the original word unchanged, rather than the plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word, num + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would receive a different number than the original, which would cause it to return a different plural form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase(), num
```
This would result in different behavior because the `plural` function would receive a different word than the original, which would cause it to return a different plural form.

DONE.
