  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `promise` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `promise` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q, op, args
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is using the `promise` variable, which is not defined in the current scope.

DONE.
