  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, baseUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` parameter would be parsed as a URL relative to `baseUrlStr`, whereas the original code fragment parsed `href` as a URL relative to the current page.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, pageUrl);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `href` parameter would be parsed as a URL relative to `pageUrl`, whereas the original code fragment parsed `href` as a URL relative to the current page.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(href, baseUrlStr, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` parameter would be used as the base URL for parsing `href`, whereas the original code fragment did not specify a base URL.

DONE.
