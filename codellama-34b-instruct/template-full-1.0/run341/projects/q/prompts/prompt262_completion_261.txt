  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `join` function will only reject if the two promises resolve to different values. However, if `resolvedPromise.reject` is used, it will always reject if the two promises resolve to the same value, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `join` function will only reject if the two promises resolve to different values. However, if `this.reject` is used, it will always reject if the two promises resolve to the same value, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `join` function will only reject if the two promises resolve to different values. However, if `Promise
