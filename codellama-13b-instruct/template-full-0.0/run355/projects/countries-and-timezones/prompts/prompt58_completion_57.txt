  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeTimezone` function is called with the `buildTimezone` function as an argument, whereas the original code fragment calls the `memoizeCountry` function with the `buildCountry` function as an argument. This would cause the `memoizeTimezone` function to be called instead of the `memoizeCountry` function, which would result in different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeCountry
```
This would result in different behavior because the `memoizeCountry` function is called with the `buildCountry` function as an argument, whereas the original code fragment calls the `memoizeTimezone` function with the `buildTimezone` function as an argument. This would cause the `memoizeCountry` function to be called instead of the `memoizeTimezone` function, which would result in different behavior.
