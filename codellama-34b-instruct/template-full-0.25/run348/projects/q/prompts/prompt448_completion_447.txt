  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop` removes the last element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This change would cause the `trackRejection` function to remove the last unhandled rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than adding a new one to the end.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, whereas `push` adds an element to the end of an array. This change would cause the `trackRejection` function to remove the first unhandled rejection from the `unhandledRejections` array, rather than adding a new one to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections.splice(0, 0, promise)
```
This would result in different behavior
