Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is a string instead of a number, which would cause the logic to incorrectly handle cases where `thisOp.retain` is a number, potentially leading to unexpected results in the composition of operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is null or undefined, which would bypass the intended logic for handling numeric retain values, leading to incorrect operation composition when `thisOp.retain` is a valid number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `thisOp.retain` is greater than zero, which would incorrectly filter out cases where `thisOp.retain` is zero, potentially altering the expected behavior of the operation composition when zero-length retains are involved.

DONE.
