Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type check from 'object' to 'string', causing the code to skip the execution of the block that handles objects, potentially leading to runtime errors if `s` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s || typeof s === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a logical OR instead of AND, which means that the condition will always evaluate to true if `s` is truthy, thus executing the block even when `s` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the type check to 'function', which would cause the code to only execute the block for functions, ignoring any valid objects that should be processed.

DONE.
