  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super[Symbol.match](string)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Symbol.match` method is not defined on the `super` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
super.match(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method is not defined on the `super` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.match(string)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `match` method is not defined on the `this` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
