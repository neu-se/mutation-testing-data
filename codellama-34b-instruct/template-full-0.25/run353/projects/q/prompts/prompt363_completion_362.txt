  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected instead of fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be in a pending state instead of fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_fulfilled(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be fulfilled with a different value.

DONE.
