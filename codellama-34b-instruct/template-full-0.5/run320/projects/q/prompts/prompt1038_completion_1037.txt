  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` returns a rejected promise, while `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This would cause the `put` method to always reject the promise, instead of resolving it like the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` returns a resolved promise, while `Q.defer` returns a pending promise. This would cause the `put` method to always resolve the promise, instead of rejecting it like the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new deferred object and resolve it, instead of using the existing deferred object like the original code. This would cause the `put` method to always resolve the promise, instead of rejecting it like the original code.

DONE.
