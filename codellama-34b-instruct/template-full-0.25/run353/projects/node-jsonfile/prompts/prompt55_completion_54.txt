  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now one greater than the original value, which could cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now one less than the original value, which could cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj, replacer, spaces * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `spaces` parameter is now twice the original value, which could cause the `JSON.stringify` method to produce a different output.

DONE.
