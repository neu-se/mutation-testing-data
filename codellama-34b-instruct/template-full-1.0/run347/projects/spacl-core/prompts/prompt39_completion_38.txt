  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would not be able to handle the edge case of the first part of the path being a variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would not be able to handle the edge case of the first part of the path being a constant.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"1.1".match(/\d+/)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the program would not be able to handle the edge case of the first part of the path being a version number with a dot separator.

DONE.
