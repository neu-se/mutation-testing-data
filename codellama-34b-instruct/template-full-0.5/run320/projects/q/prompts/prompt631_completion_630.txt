  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single token, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation expression. The resulting value would be "deletefoo", which is not a valid property name and would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single token, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation expression. The resulting value would be "delete1", which is not a valid property name and would likely cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete" + null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a single token, while the new code fragment is a string concatenation expression. The resulting value would be "deletenull", which is not a valid property name and would likely cause a runtime error.

DONE.
