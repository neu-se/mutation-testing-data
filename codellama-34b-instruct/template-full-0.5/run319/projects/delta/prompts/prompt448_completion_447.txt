  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `delete` property of the current op, regardless of whether it exists or not. In the original code, the `delete` property is only accessed if it is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `retain` property of the current op, regardless of whether it exists or not. In the original code, the `retain` property is only accessed if it is a number or a non-null object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index].insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the `insert` property of the current op, regardless of whether it exists or not. In the original code, the `insert` property is only accessed if it is a string.
