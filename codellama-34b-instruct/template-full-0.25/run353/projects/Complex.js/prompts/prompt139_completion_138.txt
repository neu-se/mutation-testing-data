  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite, while the new code checks if `z` is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is infinite, while the new code checks if `this` is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `this` is infinite, while the new code checks if `z` is zero.

DONE.
