  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `thisp` reference would be replaced with the global object, which may not be the intended scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(<PLACEHOLDER>++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would apply the `++` operator to the `thisp` reference before using it, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(--<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would apply the `--` operator to the `thisp` reference before using it, which may not be the intended behavior.

DONE.
