  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length < 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with less than 2 elements to be passed to the `fromGeoJSON` method, which would not be caught by the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length > 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with more than 2 elements to be passed to the `fromGeoJSON` method, which would not be caught by the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.coordinates.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow for an array of coordinates with 0 elements to be passed to the `fromGeoJSON` method, which would not be caught by the original code fragment.

DONE.
