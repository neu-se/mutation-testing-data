 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the order of operations, leading to potential division by zero or incorrect results when the result of `acos(r)` is not in the range of 0 to 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.acos(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.acos` function instead of the `acos` function from the `mathjs` library, which could lead to incorrect results due to different rounding or precision.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
acos(-r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the input, leading to incorrect results when the sign of the input is significant.

DONE.
