  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the y-coordinate to calculate the bearing, while the new code fragment would use the x-coordinate instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the y-coordinate to calculate the bearing, while the new code fragment would use the negative y-coordinate.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the y-coordinate to calculate the bearing, while the new code fragment would use the product of x and y instead.

DONE.
