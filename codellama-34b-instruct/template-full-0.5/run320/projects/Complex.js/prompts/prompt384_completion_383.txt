  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication by 2 would change the value of the `b` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `d` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 would change the value of the `b` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `d` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 would change the value of the `b` variable, which is used in the calculation of the `d` variable.

DONE.
