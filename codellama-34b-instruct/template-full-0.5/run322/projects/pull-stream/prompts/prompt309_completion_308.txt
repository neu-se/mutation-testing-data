  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is missing, which would cause the function to always return `true` regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test(data) && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&& false` would always return `false`, even if `test(data)` is `true`, which would cause the function to always return `false` regardless of the value of `data`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|| true` would always return `true`, even if `test(data)` is `false`, which would cause the function to always return `true` regardless of the value of `data`.

DONE.
