  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.acos()` function would return a different result for the `r` value, which is used in the calculation of the distance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.acos()` function would return a different result for the `r` value, which is used in the calculation of the distance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.acos()` function would return a different result for the `r` value, which is used in the calculation of the distance.

DONE.
