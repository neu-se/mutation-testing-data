  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus + minus < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if the sum is less than 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus - minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if the difference between `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
plus * minus > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the sum of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0, while this new code fragment checks if the product of `plus` and `minus` is greater than 0.

DONE.
