  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warn'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'warn'` instead of `'error'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'info'` instead of `'error'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event emitted would be `'debug'` instead of `'error'`, which could cause the application to behave differently.

DONE.
