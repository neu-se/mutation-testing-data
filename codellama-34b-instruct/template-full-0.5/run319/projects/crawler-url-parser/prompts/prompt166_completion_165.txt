  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of parts in the link URL is one less than the number of parts in the page URL, while this replacement checks if the number of parts in the link URL is greater than the number of parts in the page URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff <= -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of parts in the link URL is one less than the number of parts in the page URL, while this replacement checks if the number of parts in the link URL is less than or equal to the negative of the number of parts in the page URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
part_count_diff < -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of parts in the link URL is one less than the number of parts in the page URL,
