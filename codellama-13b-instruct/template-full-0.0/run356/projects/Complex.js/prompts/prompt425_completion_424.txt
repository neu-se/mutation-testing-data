  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` and `b` are equal, while the new code fragment is adding them together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` and `b` are equal, while the new code fragment is subtracting them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is checking if `a` and `b` are equal, while the new code fragment is multiplying them together.

DONE.
