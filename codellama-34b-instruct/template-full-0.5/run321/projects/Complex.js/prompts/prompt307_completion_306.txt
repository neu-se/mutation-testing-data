  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sinh` returns the hyperbolic sine of a number, which is different from the `cosh` method of the `Complex` class, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` returns the cosine of a number, which is different from the `cosh` method of the `Complex` class, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tanh` returns the hyperbolic tangent of a number, which is different from the `cosh` method of the `Complex` class, which returns the hyperbolic cosine of a complex number.

DONE.
