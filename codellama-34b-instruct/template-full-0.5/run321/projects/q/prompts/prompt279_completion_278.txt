  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the function to skip the first argument and return the remaining arguments starting from the second one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `0` instead of `1`, which would cause the function to return an empty array instead of an array containing the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument passed to `array_slice` is now `2` instead of `1`, which would cause the function to return an array containing the first two arguments instead of an array containing all arguments except the first one.
