  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when(Q.resolve(1), function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a reference to the `Q` object, while the new code fragment `Q.when(Q.resolve(1), function (value) { return value + 1; })` is a call to the `when` method of the `Q` object, which returns a promise that resolves to the result of the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `Q` is a reference to the `Q` object, while the new code fragment `Q.reject(new Error("Rejected"))` is a call to the `reject` method of the `Q` object, which returns a promise that is rejected with the specified error.
