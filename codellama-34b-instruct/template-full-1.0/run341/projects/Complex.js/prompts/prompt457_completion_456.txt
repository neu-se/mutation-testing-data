  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (!) inverts the result of the `isInfinite()` method, returning `true` if the complex number is not at the infinity pole and `false` if it is. This would cause the `toString()` method to return a different string representation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` returns `true` if the complex number is a finite number and `false` if it is not. If the complex number is finite, `toString()` will return a string representation of the complex number with the real and imaginary parts separated by a space. If the complex number is not finite, `toString()` will return the string "Infinity" regardless of the values of the real and imaginary parts.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
