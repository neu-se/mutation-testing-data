 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random() * 360
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number between 0 and 360 instead of using the provided bearing value. This can lead to unpredictable results in the `calculateDestination` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always sets the destination's bearing to 0, regardless of the input. This can lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, especially when the actual bearing is not 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
bearing + 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 180 to the bearing value, changing the direction. This can lead to incorrect results in the `calculateDestination` method, especially when the actual bearing is needed for accurate calculations.

DONE.
