  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` expects a timeout ID, and passing `0` would clear all timeouts, not just the one related to the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` expects a timeout ID, and passing `null` would clear all timeouts, not just the one related to the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearTimeout` expects a timeout ID, and passing `undefined` would clear all timeouts, not just the one related to the promise.

DONE.
