  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("call", [void 0, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("post", [name, args])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is not defined on the `Q` object, so it would throw a `TypeError`.

DONE.
