 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because `this.all()` would be called immediately, instead of waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. This could lead to unexpected results or errors if `this` does not have an `all` method or if it is not called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all.bind(this)()

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.all.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `all` method with `null` as the `this` value. This could lead to unexpected results or errors if the `all` method rel
