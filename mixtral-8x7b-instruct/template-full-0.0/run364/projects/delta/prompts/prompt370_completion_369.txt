 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.push` adds an operation to the delta, while `delta.retain` keeps the current content and adjusts the position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delta.delete` removes the content at the current position, while `delta.retain` keeps the current content and adjusts the position.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.length = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because setting `delta.length` to 0 would clear the delta's content, while `delta.retain` keeps the current content and adjusts the position.

DONE.
