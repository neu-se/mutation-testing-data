Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName) || []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array if the timezone is not found, instead of returning an object or null, which could lead to unexpected results when mapping over the values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName).countries || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `null` if the timezone is not found, instead of an empty array, which could cause issues when trying to map over the result, potentially leading to runtime errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getTimezone(tzName).countries.length > 0 ? getTimezone(tzName).countries : []
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an empty array only if the countries array has a length of zero, but would still call `getTimezone(tzName)` twice, which is inefficient and could lead to inconsistent results if the state changes between calls.

DONE.
