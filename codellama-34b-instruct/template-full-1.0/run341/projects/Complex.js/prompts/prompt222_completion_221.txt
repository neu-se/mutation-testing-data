  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the absolute value of `r` instead of `this` as the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(r) + this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds the absolute value of `r` to the absolute value of `this`, instead of using the result of `sqrt` as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r * this['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it multiplies the absolute value of `r` with the absolute value of `this`, instead of using the result of `sqrt` as the original code.

DONE.
