  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(this['im'], this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.atan2` function instead of `Math.atan`, which would give a different result for complex numbers with a negative real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(this['im'] / this['re'])
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `Math.atan` function instead of `Math.atan2`, which would give a different result for complex numbers with a negative real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan(this['im'] / this['re']) + Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds `Math.PI` to the result of `Math.atan`, which would give a different result for complex numbers with a negative real part.

DONE.
