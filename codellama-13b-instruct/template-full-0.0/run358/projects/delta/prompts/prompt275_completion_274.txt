  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peekType()
```
This would result in different behavior because the parentheses are missing in the original code, which would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
