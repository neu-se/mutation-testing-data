  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!z.isInfinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because the logical NOT operator `!` would invert the result of the `isInfinite()` method, causing the if statement to always evaluate to true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isFinite()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite()` is the opposite of `isInfinite()`, so if `isInfinite()` is true, `isFinite()` would be false, and the if statement would always evaluate to false.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.isNaN()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN()` checks if a value is NaN (Not a Number), so if `isInfinite()` is true, `isNaN()` would be false, and the if statement would always evaluate to false.

DONE.
