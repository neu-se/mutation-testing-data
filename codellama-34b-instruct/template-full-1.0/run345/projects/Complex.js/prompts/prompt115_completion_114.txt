  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `a + 1` would add 1 to the value of `a`, while the original `a` would not be modified.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a * a` would square the value of `a`, while the original `a` would remain unchanged.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a / b` would divide the value of `a` by the value of `b`, while the original code would not perform any division.

DONE.
