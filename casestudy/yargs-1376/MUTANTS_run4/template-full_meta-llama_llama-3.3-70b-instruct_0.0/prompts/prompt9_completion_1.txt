Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.hasOwnProperty
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `extends` property is directly defined on the `config` object, whereas the original code checks if the property exists anywhere in the prototype chain.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
config.extends !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `extends` property is not undefined, whereas the original code checks if the property exists as the object's own property, which could still be undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.keys(config).includes
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the string 'extends' is present in the array of the object's own enumerable properties, whereas the original code checks if the property exists as the object's own property, which could be non-enumerable.

DONE.
