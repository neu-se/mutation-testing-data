  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would always reject the promise instead of resolving it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would always throw an error instead of resolving the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `when` function would always resolve the promise with a null value instead of a non-null value.

DONE.
