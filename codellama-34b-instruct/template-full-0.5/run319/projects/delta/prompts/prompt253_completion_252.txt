  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would retain one more character than intended, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would retain one fewer character than intended, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would retain zero characters, potentially causing the test suite to fail.

DONE.
