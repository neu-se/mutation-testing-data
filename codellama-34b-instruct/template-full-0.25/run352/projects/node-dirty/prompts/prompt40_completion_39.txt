  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key, val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fn` function with the `key` and `val` arguments, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(key)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fn` function with only the `key` argument, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fn(val)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `fn` function with only the `val` argument, which may have different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
