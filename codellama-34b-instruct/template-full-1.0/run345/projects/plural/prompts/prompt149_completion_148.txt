  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = "placeholder_string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it assigns a new value to the `plural` property of `String.prototype`, which was previously undefined. This change would cause the `plural` function to always return the string "placeholder_string" instead of the correct plural form of the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(str) {return str + "palceholder_string";}
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function that appends the string "palceholder_string" to the input string, instead of the correct plural form of the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
String.prototype.plural = function(str) {return str * 2;}
```
This would result in different behavior because it defines a new function that returns the input string repeated twice, instead of the correct pl
