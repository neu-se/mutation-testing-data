  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a timezone object instead of a country object, which is not what the function is intended to do.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the same ID as the previous country, which could cause issues if the country objects are not properly updated.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prev, { [id]: getCountry(id, { deprecated: true }) }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a country object with the same ID as the previous country, but with the deprecated flag set to true, which could cause issues if the country objects are not properly updated.

DONE.
