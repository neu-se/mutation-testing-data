Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.accessSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.accessSync` checks if the file can be accessed for reading or writing, whereas `fs.existsSync` checks if the file exists, which could lead to different outcomes depending on the file system permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function(filename) { return true; }
```
This would result in different behavior because this function always returns `true`, indicating that the destination file always exists, which would cause the function to either always throw an error or always attempt to delete the file if `clobber` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.dirname
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname` returns the directory name of the given file path, rather than checking if the file exists, which would cause the `if` statement condition to always be truthy for non-empty strings, leading to incorrect handling of the destination file.

DONE.
