 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` and `self` may not refer to the same object in all cases, especially when dealing with asynchronous functions or different execution contexts.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global
```
This would result in different behavior because `global` (or `window` in a browser environment) might not always be the same as the `self` or `this` context, depending on the execution environment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because using `undefined` would cause the callback function to lose its original context (`this`), potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors in the code.

DONE.
