  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the function, while `null` is a literal value that does not have the same meaning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the function, while `undefined` is a literal value that does not have the same meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `data` is a variable that is passed as an argument to the function, while `false` is a literal value that does not have the same meaning.

DONE.
