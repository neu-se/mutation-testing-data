  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Intentional error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an intentional error, rather than being fulfilled with the original value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.reject(new Error("Intentional error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an intentional error, rather than being fulfilled with the original value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then(function () {
    return Q.resolve(new Error("Intentional error"));
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with an intentional error, rather than being rejected with the original value.

DONE.
