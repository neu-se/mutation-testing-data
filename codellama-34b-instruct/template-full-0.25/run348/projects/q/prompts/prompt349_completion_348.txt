  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object, and `null` is a primitive value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object, and `undefined` is a primitive value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `exception` is an object, and `0` is a primitive value.

DONE.
