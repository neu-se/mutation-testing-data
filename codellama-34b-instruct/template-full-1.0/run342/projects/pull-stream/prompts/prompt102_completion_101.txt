  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.error` prints the message to the error stream instead of the standard output stream, so the message would appear in the console's error output instead of the standard output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log.apply(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` will call `console.log` with an arbitrary number of arguments, which could potentially result in a different output than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log(data[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log(data[0])` would only print the first element of the `data` array, whereas the original code would print the entire array.

DONE.
