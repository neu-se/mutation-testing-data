  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would always push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, regardless of the `index` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would always push the new operation to the beginning of the `ops` array, regardless of the `index` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method would always push the new operation to the end of the `ops` array, but the `index` value would be one less than the length of the array.

DONE.
