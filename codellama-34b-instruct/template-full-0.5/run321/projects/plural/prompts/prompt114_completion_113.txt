  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` and `illnesses` arrays are concatenated, which would cause the `addRule` function to be called with a different set of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(games)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `illnesses` and `games` arrays are concatenated in a different order, which would cause the `addRule` function to be called with a different set of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses).sort()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` and `illnesses` arrays are concatenated and then sorted, which would cause the `addRule` function to be called with a different set of words.

DONE.
