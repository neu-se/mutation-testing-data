  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetFilePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.promises.access` method is being called on the `targetFilePath` instead of the `src` path, which could potentially cause the method to return a different result.
