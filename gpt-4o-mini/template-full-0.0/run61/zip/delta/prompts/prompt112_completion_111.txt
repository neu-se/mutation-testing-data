Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the value being pushed to the `passed` array from the entire operation object to just the `attributes` property of the operation, potentially losing important information about the operation itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the pushed value to only include the `insert` property of the operation, which may not represent the entire operation and could lead to incorrect results when filtering.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes a `null` value into the `passed` array instead of the operation object, which would disrupt the expected structure of the returned arrays and could lead to runtime errors when processing the results.

DONE.
