  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cos` is a trigonometric function that returns the cosine of an angle, while the replaced code fragment `cos(φ1) * cos(φ2)` is a multiplication of two cosine values, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cos` is a trigonometric function that returns the cosine of an angle, while the replaced code fragment `sin(φ1) * cos(φ2)` is a multiplication of two sine and cosine values, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(φ1) * sin(φ2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cos` is a trigonometric function
