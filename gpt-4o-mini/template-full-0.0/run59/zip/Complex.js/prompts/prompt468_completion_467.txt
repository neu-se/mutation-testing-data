Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly negate the sign of `b` when `b` is positive, leading to an incorrect representation of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the real part `a` instead of the imaginary part `b`, causing the sign of `b` to be negated based on the value of `a`, which is not the intended logic.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only negate `b` when it is exactly 1, which would not account for other negative values of `b`, leading to incorrect string representation of the complex number.

DONE.
