  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` variable is not defined in the original code, and using it would cause a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a + 1` expression would evaluate to a different value than `a`, which could cause the `logHypot` function to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sqrt(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.sqrt` function would return a different value than `a`, which could cause the `logHypot` function to produce a different result.

DONE.
