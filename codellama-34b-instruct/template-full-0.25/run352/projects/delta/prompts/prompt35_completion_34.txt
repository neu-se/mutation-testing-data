  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `b === null` would only be true if `b` is null, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` would be true for any value that is not an object, including null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because `b instanceof Object` would only be true if `b` is an instance of the `Object` class, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` would be true for any value that is not an object, including instances of other classes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toString.call(b) !== '[object Object]'
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.prototype.toString.call(b)` would return the string representation of the object, whereas `typeof b !== 'object'` would return a boolean value indicating whether the value is an object or not.

DONE.
