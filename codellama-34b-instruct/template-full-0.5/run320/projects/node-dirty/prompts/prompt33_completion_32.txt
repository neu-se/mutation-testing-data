  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a valid JSON value, but `undefined` is not. If the code is mutated to use `null` instead of `undefined`, the `JSON.parse` method will not throw an error, and the `row.val` property will be set to `null` instead of `undefined`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as if the database is corrupted or if the data is not properly formatted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object, but `undefined` is not. If the code is mutated to use `{}` instead of `undefined`, the `JSON.parse` method will not throw an error, and the `row.val` property will be set to `{}` instead of `undefined`. This could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations, such as if the database is corrupted or if the data is not properly formatted.
