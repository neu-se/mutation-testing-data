  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` is not the same as `deferred.reject` and would result in the promise being fulfilled instead of rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would result in an error when the promise is consumed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is not the same as `deferred.reject` and would result in a different function being used to handle errors.

DONE.
