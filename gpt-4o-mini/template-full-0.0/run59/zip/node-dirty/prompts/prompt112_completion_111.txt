Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row detected: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message changes, which may affect how the error is logged or handled downstream, potentially leading to confusion about the nature of the error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it emits a 'load' event instead of an 'error' event, which could mislead listeners into thinking the loading process completed successfully when it actually encountered an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${this._data.size}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because it references `this._data.size` instead of `buffer`, which may provide misleading information about the state of the data instead of the actual corrupted content.

DONE.
