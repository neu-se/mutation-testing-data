  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` variable is used to calculate the delay before the promise is resolved, and using `0` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` variable is used to calculate the delay before the promise is resolved, and using `-1` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, but with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `timeout` variable is used to calculate the delay before the promise is resolved, and using `null` would cause the promise to be resolved immediately, but with a null value.

DONE.
