  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the second element of the `rules` array, rather than checking if the first element matches the input word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the third element of the `rules` array, rather than checking if the first element matches the input word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[3]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to always return the fourth element of the `rules` array, rather than checking if the first element matches the input word.

DONE.
