  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine += 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+=` operator would increment the value of `stackLine` by 1, which would cause the regular expression to match a different index and extract the wrong file name and line number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine = stackLine.substring(stackLine.indexOf(stackLine) + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.substring()` method would extract the file name and line number from a different index in the `stackLine` string, which would cause the regular expressions to match different file names and line numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine = stackLine.slice(-1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.slice()` method would take the last character of the `stackLine` string, which would cause the regular expressions to match a different file name and line number.

DONE.
