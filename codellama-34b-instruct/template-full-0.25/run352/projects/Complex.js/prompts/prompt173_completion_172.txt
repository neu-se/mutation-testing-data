  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite'](<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if it were executed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isInfinite` method is not defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would throw a `TypeError` if it were executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isZero` method is defined for the `Complex` class, and the code would execute correctly if it were replaced with this method.

DONE.
