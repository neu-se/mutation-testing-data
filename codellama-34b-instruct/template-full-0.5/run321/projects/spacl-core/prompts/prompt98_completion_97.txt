  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value "foo" instead of the actual name of the policy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the policy in uppercase letters, which may not match the actual name of the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the name of the policy without the first character, which may not match the actual name of the policy.

DONE.
