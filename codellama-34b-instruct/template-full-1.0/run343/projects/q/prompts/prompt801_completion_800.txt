  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function <PLACEHOLDER>()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer be anonymous, and the return value of the function would not be a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function * <PLACEHOLDER>()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would now be a generator function, and the return value of the function would not be a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const <PLACEHOLDER> = function ()
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would no longer be anonymous, and the return value of the function would not be a promise.

DONE.
