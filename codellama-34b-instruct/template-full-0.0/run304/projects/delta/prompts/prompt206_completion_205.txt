  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete()
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete()` is a method that deletes the contents of a `Delta` object, whereas `push()` is a method that adds new content to the end of a `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain(0)` is a method that retains the current content of a `Delta` object, whereas `push()` is a method that adds new content to the end of a `Delta` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(new Delta())
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat()` is a method that concatenates the contents of two `Delta` objects, whereas `push()` is a method that adds new content to the end of a `Delta` object.

DONE.
