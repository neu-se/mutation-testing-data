  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port1.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because the `port1` property is different from the `port2` property used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.port3.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because `port3` does not exist in the `channel` object, so the code would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
channel.postMessage
```
This would result in different behavior because the `postMessage` method is called on the `channel` object directly, rather than on one of its properties.

DONE.
