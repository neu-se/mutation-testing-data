  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to λ2 would cause the calculation of the destination point to be shifted by 1 degree in the longitude direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from λ2 would cause the calculation of the destination point to be shifted by 1 degree in the longitude direction in the opposite direction.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2 * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by λ2 would cause the calculation of the destination point to be shifted by 2 degrees in the longitude direction.

DONE.
