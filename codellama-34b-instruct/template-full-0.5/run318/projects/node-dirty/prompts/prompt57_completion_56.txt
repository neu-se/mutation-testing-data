  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `error` event would be emitted instead of the `drain` event, which would cause the `close` method to be called even if there are still items in the queue.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called even if there are still items in the queue, which could cause the program to exit prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', () => this.close()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `close` method would be called when the write stream is closed, which could cause the program to exit prematurely if there are still items in the queue.

DONE.
