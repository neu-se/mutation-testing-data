  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `null`, while `false` would return a boolean value instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `i++`, while `0` would return a constant value instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `cb(<PLACEHOLDER>, i++)`, while `undefined` would return a value that is not defined, potentially causing errors in the code.

DONE.
