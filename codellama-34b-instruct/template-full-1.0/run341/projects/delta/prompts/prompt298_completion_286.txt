  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return false;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would stop executing at that point and return the value `false`, instead of continuing with the rest of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would stop executing at that point and return the value `undefined`, instead of continuing with the rest of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return -1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would stop executing at that point and return the value `-1`, instead of continuing with the rest of the function.

DONE.
