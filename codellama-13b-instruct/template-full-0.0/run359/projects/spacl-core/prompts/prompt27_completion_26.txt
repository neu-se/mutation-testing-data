  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with the `final` argument set to `true`, which would cause it to add a `$` character to the end of the regular expression, making it match the entire input string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called with the `final` argument set to `false`, which would cause it to not add a `$` character to the end of the regular expression, making it match only a prefix of the input string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `flatten` function is called without any arguments, which would cause it to use the default value of `false` for the `final` argument, making it match only a prefix of the input string.

DONE.
