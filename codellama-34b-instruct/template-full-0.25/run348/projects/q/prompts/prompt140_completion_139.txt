  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is falsy and `false` if the operand is truthy. In contrast, the `!!` operator is a double NOT, which returns `true` if the operand is truthy and `false` if the operand is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
p = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `p` variable is not defined in the provided code snippet, and assigning a value to it would create a new variable in the global scope.

DONE.
