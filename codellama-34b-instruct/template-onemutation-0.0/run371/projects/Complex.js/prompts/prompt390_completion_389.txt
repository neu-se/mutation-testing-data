  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, while `a + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `a`. This change would cause the `sech` function to return a different value than it would with the original code fragment.

DONE.
