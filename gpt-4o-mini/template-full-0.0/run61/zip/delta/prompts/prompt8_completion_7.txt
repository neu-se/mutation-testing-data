Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include keys with `null` values in the resulting attributes, whereas the original code excludes them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow attributes with a value of `0` to be included, ignoring all other falsy values (like `null` or `undefined`), which the original code does not do.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include all falsy values (like `0`, `false`, `null`, and `undefined`), whereas the original code only excludes `null` and retains other valid values.

DONE.
