  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil()` rounds up to the nearest integer, whereas `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.trunc
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc()` rounds towards zero, whereas `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest integer or away from zero.

DONE.
