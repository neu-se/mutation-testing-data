  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.abs` function to ensure that the hypotenuse is always calculated correctly, while `a * b` could result in an overflow for large values of `a` and `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `Math.abs` function to ensure that the hypotenuse is always calculated correctly, while `a + b` could result in an underflow for small values of `a` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `a` and `b` to calculate the hypotenuse, while `b` alone would calculate the opposite leg of the triangle.

DONE.
