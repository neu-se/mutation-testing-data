  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the same array elements multiple times, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.rules.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.slice()` method creates a shallow copy of the `rules` array, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the same array elements multiple times, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `.slice()` method is called on the `rules` array instead of the `this` object, which would cause the `for...of` loop to iterate over the same array elements multiple times, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
