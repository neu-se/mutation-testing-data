  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return inverted;
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the `invert` method returns a new `Delta` object, whereas this modification would return the `inverted` object itself, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return new Delta(inverted);
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the `invert` method returns a new `Delta` object with the same `ops` property as the `inverted` object, whereas this modification would return a new `Delta` object with a copy of the `ops` property from `inverted`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Test');
```
This would result in different behavior because, in the original code, the `invert` method returns a new `Delta` object even if it throws an error, whereas this modification would throw an error instead of returning a new `
