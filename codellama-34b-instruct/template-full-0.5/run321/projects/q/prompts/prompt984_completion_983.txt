  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise instead of rejecting it, which would cause the test to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.notify` would send a notification instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the test to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` would create a new node resolver instead of rejecting the promise, which would cause the test to pass even if the function is not working correctly.

DONE.
