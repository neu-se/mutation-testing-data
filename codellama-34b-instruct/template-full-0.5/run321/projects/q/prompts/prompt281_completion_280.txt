  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a valid index for the `arguments` array, but it would not be the same as using `arguments` directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a valid index for the `arguments` array, but it would not be the same as using `arguments` directly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because `-1` is not a valid index for the `arguments` array, and it would cause an error if used in the same way as `arguments`.

DONE.
