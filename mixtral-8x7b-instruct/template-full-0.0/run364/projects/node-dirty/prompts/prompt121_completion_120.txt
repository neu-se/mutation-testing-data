 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain', this._inFlightWrites)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a 'drain' event with no arguments, while this modification would emit the event with the number of in-flight writes as an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drained')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a 'drain' event, while this modification would emit a 'drained' event instead, which is not handled or checked for in the rest of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
global.emit('drain')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits the 'drain' event on the current instance of the Dirty class, while this modification would emit the event on the global object, which is unlikely to have the 'emit' method and would therefore throw an error.
