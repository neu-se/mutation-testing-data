  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push a new op to the ops array, while the replaced code fragment would push null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push a new op to the ops array, while the replaced code fragment would push the last op in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would push a new op to the ops array, while the replaced code fragment would push the next op in the array.

DONE.
