  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `substr` method to remove the last two characters of the word and append "ices" to the end, while the buggy code fragment uses the `slice` method to remove the last two characters of the word and append "ices" to the end. The `slice` method is used to extract a section of a string, while the `substr` method is used to extract a section of a string and return the extracted part as a new string.

/appendix|index/i, function(w) { return w.slice(0, w.length - 2) + 'ices' }
