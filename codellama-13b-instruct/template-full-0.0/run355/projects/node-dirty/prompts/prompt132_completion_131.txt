  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `of` operator to destructure the `this._queue` array, while the new code fragment uses the `=` operator to assign the `key` and `cbs` variables. This change would result in a different order of evaluation, which could potentially cause different behavior in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.slice(0, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `of` operator to destructure the `this._queue` array, while the new code fragment uses the `slice` method to extract the first two elements of the array. This change would result in a different order of evaluation, which could potentially cause different behavior in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, cbs] = this._queue.sp
