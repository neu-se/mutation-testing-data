Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly attempt to remove the unhandled reason at the next index instead of the current index, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error or incorrect state management.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always remove the first element of the `unhandledReasons` array, regardless of which promise was untracked, leading to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledReasons.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to splice the `unhandledReasons` array at an index equal to its length, which would not remove any elements and could lead to an incorrect state where the reasons for unhandled rejections are not properly cleared.

DONE.
