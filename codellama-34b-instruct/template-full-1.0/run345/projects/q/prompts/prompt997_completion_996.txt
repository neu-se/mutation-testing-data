  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeRejector
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeRejector` creates a function that rejects a promise with the given reason, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` creates a function that resolves a promise with the given value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a rejected promise with the given reason, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` creates a function that resolves a promise with the given value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, whereas `deferred.makeNodeResolver` creates a function.

DONE.
