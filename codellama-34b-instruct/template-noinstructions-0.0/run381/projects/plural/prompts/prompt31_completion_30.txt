  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "crises" for the word "crisis", while the new code fragment would return "crisis".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'is' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "crises" for the word "crisis", while the new code fragment would return "crisis".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would return "crises" for the word "crisis", while the new code fragment would return "
