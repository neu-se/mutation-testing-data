  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections[0], promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always check the first element in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, rather than the element at the index of the current promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unhandledRejections, promise
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `unhandledRejections` array, which is not the same as the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reportedUnhandledRejections, unhandledRejections
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, but also include the `unhandledRejections` array as a second argument.

DONE.
