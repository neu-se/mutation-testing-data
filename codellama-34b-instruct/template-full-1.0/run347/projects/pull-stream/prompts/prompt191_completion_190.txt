  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the map function to be called with a different number of arguments, which could cause errors in the code that uses the `asyncMap` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.map
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `map` function to be called with a different `this` context, which could cause errors in the code that uses the `asyncMap` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.prop
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `prop` function to be called with a different number of arguments, which could cause errors in the code that uses the `asyncMap` function.

DONE.
