Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the end index `r` instead of the start index `l` to calculate the quantile select position, potentially altering the order in which elements are selected and affecting the final result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.floor(indices[m])
```
This would result in different behavior because it takes the floor of the middle index `m` instead of using the start index `l`, changing the base position for the recursive quantile select and affecting how the array is partitioned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
l
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the loop variable `l` as the index, bypassing the `indices` array and potentially skipping or repeating certain positions in the array during the quantile selection process.

DONE.
