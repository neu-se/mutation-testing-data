  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Something went wrong"))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `reject` function to be called with a new error object, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fulfill(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `fulfill` function to be called with a value of `null`, which would result in the promise being fulfilled with a value of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.master(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `master` function to be called with a value of `null`, which would result in a new promise being created that is wrapping the `null` value.

DONE.
