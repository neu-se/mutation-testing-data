  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called with a different argument, which would result in a different offset string being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called with a different argument, which would result in a different offset string being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getOffsetStr(utcOffset * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called with a different argument, which would result in a different offset string being returned.

DONE.
