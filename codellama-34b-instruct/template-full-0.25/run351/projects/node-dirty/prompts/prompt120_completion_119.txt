  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if it is greater than zero. This would cause the code to behave differently when the number of in-flight writes is zero or negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less than or equal to zero, while the new code fragment checks if it is equal to zero. This would cause the code to behave differently when the number of in-flight writes is negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._inFlightWrites !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the number of in-flight writes is less
