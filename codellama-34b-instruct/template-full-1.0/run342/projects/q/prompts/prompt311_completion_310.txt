  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
f(answerPs[i])
```
This would result in an immediate rejection of the promise, because the function `f` is not defined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
g(answerPs[i])
```
This would result in an additional rejection of the promise, because the function `g` is not defined and would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
h(answerPs[i])
```
This would result in the promise being fulfilled with the value `answerPs[i]`, because the function `h` is not defined and the argument `answerPs[i]` is returned.

DONE.
