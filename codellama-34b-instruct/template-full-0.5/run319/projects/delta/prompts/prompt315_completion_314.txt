  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 + Op.length(op)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the length to be incremented by 1, potentially resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the length to be doubled, potentially resulting in a different value being returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length(op) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the length to be decremented by 1, potentially resulting in a different value being returned.

DONE.
