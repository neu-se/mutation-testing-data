  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters, the current code would return `null`, but the replaced code would return the parsed URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!(baseUrlStr && _has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr))
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters, the current code would return `null`, but the replaced code would return the parsed URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr && !_has_illegal_chars(baseUrlStr) && baseUrlStr.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because if the `baseUrlStr` contains illegal characters, the current code would return `null`, but the replaced code would return the parsed URL only if the `baseUrlStr` is not empty.
