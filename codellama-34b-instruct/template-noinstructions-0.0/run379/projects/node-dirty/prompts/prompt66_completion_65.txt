  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method would be called on the write stream, which would cause it to close immediately, rather than waiting for all data to be flushed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy()` method would be called on the write stream, which would cause it to close immediately, rather than waiting for all data to be flushed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end(() => {});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end()` method would be called on the write stream, which would cause it to close immediately, rather than waiting for all data to be flushed. Additionally, the callback function passed to `end()` would be called immediately, rather than waiting for the data to be flushed.

DONE.
