  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would add the 'ies' ending to words that were previously uncountable, causing the plural function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 's' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the new rule would add the 's' ending
