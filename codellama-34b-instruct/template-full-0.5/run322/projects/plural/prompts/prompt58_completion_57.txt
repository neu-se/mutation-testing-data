  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('criterion', 'criterions')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a typo in the rule for "criterion" and the plural form is "criteria", not "criterions".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('bacterium', 'bacteria')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a typo in the rule for "bacterium" and the plural form is "bacteria", not "bacteriums".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule('memo', 'memos')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code has a typo in the rule for "memo" and the plural form is "memos", not "memoes".

DONE.
