  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, abort, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, null, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with a different set of arguments than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `abortCb` function with a different set of arguments than the original code.

DONE.
