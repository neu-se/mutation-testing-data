  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a variable, while `x + 1` is an expression that adds 1 to the value of `x`. This change would cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce different results for the same input values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
y
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a variable, while `y` is a different variable. This change would cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce different results for the same input values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `x` is a variable, while `Math.random()` is a function that returns a random number. This change would cause the `calculateDestination` function to produce different results for the same input values.

DONE.
