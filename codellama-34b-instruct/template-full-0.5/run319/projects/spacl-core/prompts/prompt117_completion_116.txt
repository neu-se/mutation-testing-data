  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && !this.verbs[verb]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any verb that is not explicitly denied, rather than only allowing explicitly allowed verbs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) || verb in this.verbs
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any verb that is not explicitly denied, rather than only allowing explicitly allowed verbs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.matches(path, ctx) && this.verbs[verb] === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow any verb that is explicitly denied, rather than only allowing explicitly allowed verbs.

DONE.
