  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+\/$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string ends with a slash, while the new code fragment checks if it does not end with a slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string ends with a slash, while the new code fragment checks if it contains at least one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^.+$/) === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `spec` string ends with a slash, while the new code fragment checks if it does not contain any characters.

DONE.
