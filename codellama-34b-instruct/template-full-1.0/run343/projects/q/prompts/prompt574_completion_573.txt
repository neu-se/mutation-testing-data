  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, []
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive a `null` `this` value and an empty `arguments` object, which could lead to errors or unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive an `undefined` `this` value and an array of three values, which could lead to errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}, [1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeGenerator` function would receive an empty object as the `this` value and an array of three values, which could lead to errors or unexpected results.

DONE.
