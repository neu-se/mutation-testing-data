  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(word, num) { return word + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a regular expression to match the word and apply the appropriate pluralization rule, while the new code fragment simply appends an 's' to the word.

DONE.
