  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because `options.encoding` would return the encoding of the file, while `options` would return the entire options object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"utf8"
```
This would result in different behavior because "utf8" is a hard-coded encoding, while `options` could specify any encoding.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a falsy value, while `options` could be any value.

DONE.
