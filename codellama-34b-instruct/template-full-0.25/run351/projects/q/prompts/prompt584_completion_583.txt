  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return reject(exception);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the result, which could cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return when(result.value, callback, errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of the result, which could cause the program to behave differently.

DONE.
