  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `currentUrl.baseurl` is a different object than `baseUrl`, and the `gettype` function relies on the properties of `baseUrl` to determine the link type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrl.baseurl
```
This would result in different behavior because `baseUrl.baseurl` is a different object than `currentUrl`, and the `gettype` function relies on the properties of `currentUrl` to determine the link type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not an object and does not have the properties that the `gettype` function relies on to determine the link type.

DONE.
