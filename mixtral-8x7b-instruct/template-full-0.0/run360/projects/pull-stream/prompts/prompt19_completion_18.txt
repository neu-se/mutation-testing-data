 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the second argument of the `ref` array instead of the first one, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if the arguments are not properly checked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove and return the last element of the `ref` array, instead of accessing the first element. This could cause unexpected results or errors if the arguments are not properly checked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `ref` array minus one, which is the index of the last element. This would cause the code to always return the last element of the `ref` array, instead of the first one, potentially causing unexpected results or errors if the arguments are not properly checked.

DONE.
