  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `object` while this code fragment returns only the `value` property of the `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `object` while this code fragment returns the length of the `value` property of the `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.value.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire `object` while this code fragment returns the length of the `value` property of the `object` minus 1.

DONE.
