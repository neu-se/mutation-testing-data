```javascript
function () { return Promise.resolve(); }

This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would receive a new error object instead of the original rejection reason, which would cause the `rejection` object to have a different `message` property.

```javascript
function () { return Q.reject(new Error('New error')); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` block would receive a rejected promise with a new error object instead of the original rejection reason, which would cause the `rejection` object to have a different `message
