  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value is falsy, while the new code checks if it's null specifically.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value is falsy, while the new code checks if it's undefined specifically.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the value is falsy, while the new code checks if it's the boolean value false specifically.

DONE.
