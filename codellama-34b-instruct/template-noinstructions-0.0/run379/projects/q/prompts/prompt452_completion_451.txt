  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0)` would create a shallow copy of the `stack` property, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not recognize the rejection as handled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would create a shallow copy of the `stack` property, starting from the second element, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not recognize the rejection as handled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.stack.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(0, 1)` would create a shallow copy of the `stack` property, starting from the first element and ending at the second element, which would cause the `untrackRejection` function to not recognize the rejection as handled
