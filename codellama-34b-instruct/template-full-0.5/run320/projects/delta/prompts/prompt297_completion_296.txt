  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the line attribute is always an empty object, which may cause the predicate function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(2).attributes || {}, i) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the line attribute is now an object with two attributes, which may cause the predicate function to return a different value than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i + 1) === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the line attribute is now an object with one attribute, and the index i is incremented by 1, which may cause the predicate function to return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
