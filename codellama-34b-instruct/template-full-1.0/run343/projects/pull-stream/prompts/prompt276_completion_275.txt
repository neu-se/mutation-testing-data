  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling the `nextChunk` function, it would call the `nextStream` function, which has a different purpose and could potentially cause unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would bypass the call to `nextChunk` and directly move to the next stream, potentially causing the function to skip over important data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value as the second argument to the `_read` function, which could cause it to behave differently or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
