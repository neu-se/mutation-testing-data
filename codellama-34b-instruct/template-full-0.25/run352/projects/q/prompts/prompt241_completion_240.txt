  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPromiseAlike` is a different function than `isPromise`, and it may have a different implementation that could affect the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isPromise
```
This would result in different behavior because `!isPromise` is the negation of `isPromise`, and it could cause the code to behave differently if the value being checked is not a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isPromise && isPromiseAlike
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only evaluate to `true` if both `isPromise` and `isPromiseAlike` are `true`, which could cause the code to behave differently if the value being checked is not a promise.

DONE.
