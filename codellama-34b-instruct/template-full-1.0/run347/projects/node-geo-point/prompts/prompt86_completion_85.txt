  Option 1:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the sign of the `sinθ` term would be flipped, leading to the wrong calculation of the destination latitude.

Option 2:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ - cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅cosθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the signs of both the `sinθ` and `cosθ` terms would be swapped, leading to the wrong calculation of the destination latitude and longitude.

Option 3:
```
sinφ2 = sinφ1⋅cosδ + cosφ1⋅sinδ⋅sinθ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosθ` term would be changed to `sinθ`, leading to the wrong calculation of the destination latitude and longitude.

DONE.
