  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the negation of `aborted`, whereas the original code fragment would only return `aborted` if it is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
aborted+1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `aborted+1`, whereas the original code fragment would only return `aborted` if it is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `null`, whereas the original code fragment would only return `aborted` if it is truthy.

DONE.
