  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the test function is only called if !cb (if cb is falsy), but in the modified code, the test function would be called unconditionally.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
cb === test
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the test function is only called if !cb (if cb is falsy), but in the modified code, the test function would be called if cb is strictly equal to test (which is unlikely).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with
```
test(cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the test function is only called if !cb (if cb is falsy), but in the modified code, the test function would be called with cb as an argument.

DONE.
