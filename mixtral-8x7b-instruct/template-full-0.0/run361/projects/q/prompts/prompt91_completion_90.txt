 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { return [1, 2, 3]; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array_slice` function would now always return a new array with the values `[1, 2, 3]` instead of using the original array and its properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw a `TypeError` when `uncurryThis` is called with `null` as its argument, causing the `array_reduce`, `array_indexOf`, `array_map`, `object_create`, `object_defineProperty`, `object_hasOwnProperty`, `object_keys`, and `isObject` functions to not be defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of the `Array.prototype.slice` function, causing the
