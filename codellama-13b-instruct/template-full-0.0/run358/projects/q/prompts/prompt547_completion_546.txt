  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would not be called, and the promise would be resolved instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called, and the promise would be rejected instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function would be called on the `deferred` object, and the promise would be rejected instead.

DONE.
