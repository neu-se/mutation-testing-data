  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would return the value of the `end` variable, while the new code fragment `null` would return the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would return the value of the `end` variable, while the new code fragment `undefined` would return the value `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` would return the value of the `end` variable, while the new code fragment `false` would return the value `false`.

DONE.
