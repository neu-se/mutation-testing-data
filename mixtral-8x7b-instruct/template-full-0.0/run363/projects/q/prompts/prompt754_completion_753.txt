 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is passed to the `any` function, which would immediately resolve the promise with an empty array instead of waiting for the first resolved promise from the input array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because a resolved promise is passed to the `any` function, which would immediately resolve the promise with `undefined` instead of waiting for the first resolved promise from the input array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Test error'))
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise is passed to the `any` function, which would immediately reject the promise with the provided error instead of waiting for the first resolved promise from the input array.

DONE.
