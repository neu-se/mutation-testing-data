  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileSync` is the synchronous version of `readFile`, and it does not return a promise. In the original code, `universalify.fromPromise` is used to convert the synchronous function into an asynchronous one, but with the incorrect code fragment, the promise will never be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
readFileAsync
```
This would result in different behavior because `readFileAsync` is not a defined function in the code snippet. It will cause a reference error, which will make the test fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
anotherReadFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `anotherReadFile` is not defined anywhere in the code snippet, and it will cause a reference error, which will make the test fail.

DONE.
