 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
atReport.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `length` property of `atReport`, which is not defined in this context. The original code fragment, `atReport`, refers to the index of the promise in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, which is a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
atReport + 1
