  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this['isZero']` will return `true` if `this['isZero']` is `false`, and `false` if `this['isZero']` is `true`. This will cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this['isZero']` is `true`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isReal']
```
This would result in different behavior because `this['isReal']` will return `true` if `this['im']` is `0`, and `false` otherwise. This will cause the function to return `Complex['INFINITY']` when `this['im']` is not `0`, which is not the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isReal']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!this['
