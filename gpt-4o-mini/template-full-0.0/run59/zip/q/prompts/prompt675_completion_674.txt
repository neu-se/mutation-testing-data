Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "call" suggests invoking a function directly rather than applying arguments to it, which changes the intended use of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"applyWithContext"
```
This would result in different behavior because "applyWithContext" is not a standard method and would likely lead to an error or undefined behavior, as it does not exist in the context of the Promise prototype.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"execute"
```
This would result in different behavior because "execute" implies a different operation than "apply," potentially leading to incorrect handling of the function invocation and its arguments.

DONE.
