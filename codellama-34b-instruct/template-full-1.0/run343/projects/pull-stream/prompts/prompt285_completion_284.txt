  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `cb`, so when `cb` is called, it will return `false` instead of executing the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is called with `null` instead of the expected `err` and `data` arguments, which would cause the callback function to execute with the wrong arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` function is called without any arguments, which would cause the callback function to execute without the expected arguments.

DONE.
