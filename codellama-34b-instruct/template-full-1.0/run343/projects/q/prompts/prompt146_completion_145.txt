  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__minimumStackCounter_"
```
This would result in different behavior because the underscore at the end of the variable name is missing, causing a reference error when the property is accessed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"_maximumStackCounter"
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable name is different, causing the `object_defineProperty` function to create a new property with a different name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"stackCounter"
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable name is different, causing the `object_defineProperty` function to create a new property with a different name, rather than modifying the existing `stackCounter` property.

DONE.
