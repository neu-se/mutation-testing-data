  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof b !== 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator returns the type of a value as a string. If `b` is not an object, it will not be equal to the string `'function'`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!b instanceof Object
```
This would result in different behavior because the `instanceof` operator checks if a value is an instance of a particular class. If `b` is not an object, it will not be an instance of the `Object` class.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== Object(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object(b)` converts any value to an object. If `b` is not an object, it will not be equal to its own object conversion.

DONE.
