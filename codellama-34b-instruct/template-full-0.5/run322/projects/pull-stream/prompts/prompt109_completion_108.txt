  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = reducer(acc, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because `reducer` is a function that takes two arguments, but `acc` and `data` are not the correct arguments for `reducer`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data
```
This would result in different behavior because `data` is not the same as `acc`, which is the accumulated value from the previous iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
acc = data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `data * 2` is not the same as `acc`, which is the accumulated value from the previous iteration.

DONE.
