 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to false, overriding the original behavior of checking the truthiness of the variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to 0, which would be falsy, overriding the original behavior of checking the truthiness of the variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `trackUnhandledRejections` variable would be set to null, which would be falsy, overriding the original behavior of checking the truthiness of the variable.

DONE.
