  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now return `false` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now return the opposite of what it originally returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would now return `true` for all items, regardless of whether they have been seen before or not.

DONE.
