  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isNaN()` function returns true for any value that is Not-a-Number, while the `!isNaN()` function returns true for any value that is a Number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN()` function is similar to `isNaN()` but it returns `true` only if the value is exactly `NaN`, while the `isNaN()` function returns `true` if the value is `NaN` or any other value that is Not-a-Number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.isNaN()` function is similar to `isNaN()` but it returns `true` only if the value is exactly `NaN`, while the `isNaN()` function returns `true` if the value is `NaN` or any other value that
