  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` parameter, which is a promise, while replacing it with `null` would return a promise that is resolved with `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` parameter, which is a promise, while replacing it with `undefined` would return a promise that is resolved with `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Test error"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the `object` parameter, which is a promise, while replacing it with a rejected promise would cause the `done` method to throw an error.

DONE.
