  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.ceil
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` and `Math.floor` are different functions that round numbers in different ways. `Math.ceil` rounds a number up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

For example, if `this['im']` is 0.5, `Math.floor(this['im'] * places) / places` would return 0, while `Math.ceil(this['im'] * places) / places` would return 1.
