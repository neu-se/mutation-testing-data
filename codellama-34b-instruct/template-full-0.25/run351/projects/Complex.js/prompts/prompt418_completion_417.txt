  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!this['isZero']` would return `true` if the complex number is not zero, while `this['isZero']` would return `true` if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero, while `isZero` only checks if the real part is zero.

DONE.
