  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Array.from(urlMap.values());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.values()` method, which returns an iterator over the values in the map, while the new code fragment uses the `Array.from()` method, which creates a new array from an iterable object, such as a map. The `Array.from()` method does not preserve the order of the values in the map, while the `Map.values()` method does.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Array.from(urlMap.keys());
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Map.values()` method, which returns an iterator over the values in the map, while the new code fragment uses the `Array.from()` method, which creates a new array from an iterable object, such as a map. The `Array.from()` method does not preserve the order of the values in the map, while the `Map.keys()` method does.
