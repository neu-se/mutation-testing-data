  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `length` is used instead of `length + 1`, which would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `length - 1` is used instead of `length`, which would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length * 2);
```
This would result in different behavior because `length * 2` is used instead of `length`, which would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a different value.

DONE.
