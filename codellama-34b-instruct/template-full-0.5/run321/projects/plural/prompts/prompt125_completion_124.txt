  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the word to uppercase, resulting in a different plural form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\b(?:tea|sugar|water|air|rice|knowledge|beauty|anger|fear|love|money|research|safety|evidence)\b/i, function(w) { return w.length > 5 ? w.slice(0, 5) : w }
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would return the word truncated to 5 characters if it is longer than 5 characters, resulting in a different plural form.
