  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the callback with the accumulated value, while this new code fragment calls the callback with both the error and the accumulated value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(acc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code fragment only calls the callback with the accumulated value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the callback with the error and the accumulated value, while this new code fragment calls the callback with the error and a null value.

DONE.
