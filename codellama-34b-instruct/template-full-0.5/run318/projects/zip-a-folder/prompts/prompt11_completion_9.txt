  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart);
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `src` string on commas and then globs each part, but this new code fragment splits the `src` string on commas and then globs each part, but it also adds a new `forEach` loop that iterates over the resulting array and globs each part again. This would result in duplicate globs, which could potentially cause issues with the compression algorithm.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',').forEach((globPart) => {
    zipArchive.glob(globPart, {});
});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only splits the `src` string on commas and then globs each part, but this new code fragment splits the `src` string on commas and then globs each part with an empty options object. This would result in
