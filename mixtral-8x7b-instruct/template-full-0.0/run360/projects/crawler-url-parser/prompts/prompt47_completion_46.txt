 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedBaseUrl.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` might return a different string representation of the object than the default one, potentially causing issues with the URL comparison or formatting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
URL.format({ ...parsedBaseUrl })
```
This would result in different behavior because spreading the `parsedBaseUrl` object into a new object and then formatting it might result in a different string representation, potentially causing issues with the URL comparison or formatting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
parsedBaseUrl.host
