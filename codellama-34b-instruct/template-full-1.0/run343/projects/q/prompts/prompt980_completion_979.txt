  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (resolution, message) {
    if (deferred.promise !== undefined) {
        deferred.resolver(resolution, message);
    } else {
        deferred.promise = Q.reject(message);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the nodeArgs array to be pushed onto the array of arguments passed to `nodeArgs.push()`, which would result in an incorrect number of arguments being passed to the `makeNodeResolver()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function (resolution, message) {
    if (deferred.promise !== undefined) {
        deferred.resolver(resolution, message);
    } else {
        deferred.promise = Q.reject(message);
    }
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `makeNodeResolver()` function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would result in an error being thrown.
