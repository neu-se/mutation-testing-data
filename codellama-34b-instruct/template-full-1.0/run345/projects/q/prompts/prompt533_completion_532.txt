  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a specific `this` context, but in this case, we're not using the returned function, so the `this` context doesn't matter.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` immediately invokes the function with the given `this` context, but in this case, we're not returning the result of the invocation, so the result of the function call doesn't matter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(null, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `apply` immediately invokes the function with the given `this` context and arguments, but in this case, we're not returning the result of the invocation, so the result of the function call doesn't matter.

DONE.
