  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a function reference, while `onEnd()` is a function call. The function call would execute the `onEnd` function immediately, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onEnd + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a function reference, while `onEnd + 1` is a mathematical operation that adds 1 to the function reference. This would result in a different value being passed to the `once` function, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `onEnd` is a function reference, while `null` is a null value. This would result in a different value being passed to the `once` function, which may not be the intended behavior.
