  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` if the number is not infinite, while `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` returns `true` if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` is the logical NOT operator, so `!this['isInfinite']()` would return `true` if the number is not infinite, while `this['isInfinite']()` would return `true` if the number is infinite.

DONE.
