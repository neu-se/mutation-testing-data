  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!extractFilename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `extractFilename`, so the code would always enter the `if` block, even if `extractFilename` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the code would only enter the `if` block if `extractFilename` is `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
extractFilename !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would only enter the `if` block if `extractFilename` is not `true`.

DONE.
