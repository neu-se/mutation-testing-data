Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context from the arguments passed to the function to the current instance of the Promise, which would lead to incorrect behavior when trying to access the original arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected array of arguments with an empty array, causing the function to not pass any arguments to the callback, which would likely lead to errors or unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the arguments with `null`, which would not be valid for the function expecting an array of arguments, potentially causing runtime errors or incorrect handling of the callback.

DONE.
