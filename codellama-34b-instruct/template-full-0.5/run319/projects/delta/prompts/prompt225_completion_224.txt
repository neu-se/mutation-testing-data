  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the arguments to the `diff` function are reversed, causing the comparison to be done in the opposite direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument to the `diff` function is the same as the first argument, causing the function to compare the string to itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], null
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to the `diff` function is `null`, causing the function to use the default cursor position of 0 instead of the provided cursor position.

DONE.
