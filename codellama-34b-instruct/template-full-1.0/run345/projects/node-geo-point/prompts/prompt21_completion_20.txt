  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.hasOwnProperty('latitude') && object.hasOwnProperty('longitude')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` check would always return true, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to false, and the function would return a `GeoPoint` object with latitude and longitude set to `NaN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.latitude === undefined || object.longitude === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `=== undefined` check would always return true, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to true, and the function would always throw a `TypeError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object['latitude'] === undefined || object['longitude'] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` comparison would always return false, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to false, and the function would return a `GeoPoint
