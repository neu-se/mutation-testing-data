  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` is a JavaScript keyword that can be used to throw an exception, whereas `reject` is a function that is part of the Promise API.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return
```
This would result in different behavior because `return` is a JavaScript keyword that can be used to exit a function or method, whereas `reject` is a function that is used to reject a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value in JavaScript that represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable, whereas `reject` is a function that is used to reject a promise.

DONE.
