  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
games.concat(illnesses)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` array is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
illnesses.concat(games)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `illnesses` array is not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
['games', 'illnesses']
```
This would result in different behavior because the `games` and `illnesses` arrays are not defined in the code snippet, so it would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
