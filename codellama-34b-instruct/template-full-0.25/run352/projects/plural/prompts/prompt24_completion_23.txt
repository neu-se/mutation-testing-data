  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a length of 2 for the substr method, while the new code fragment uses a length of 1. This would cause the resulting word to have one fewer letter than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 2) + 'us' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a length of 2 for the substr method, while the new code fragment uses a length of 2 and appends the letter 'us' to the end of the word. This would cause the resulting word to have two fewer letters than expected and have
