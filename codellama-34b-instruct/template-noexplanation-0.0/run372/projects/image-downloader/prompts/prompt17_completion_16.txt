  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.toLowerCase()
```
This change will cause the filename to be lowercased, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.split('.')[0]
```
This change will cause the filename to be truncated to the first part before the first dot, which may not be desirable in all cases.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
decodedBasename.replace(/[^\w\d]/g, '')
```
This change will cause the filename to be stripped of any non-alphanumeric characters, which may not be desirable in all cases.

DONE.
