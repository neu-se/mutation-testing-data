  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator will always return `0` if `places` is not truthy, regardless of its value. In the original code, `places || 0` will return `0` only if `places` is nullish (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or `NaN`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ^ 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `^` operator will always return `0` if `places` is `0`, regardless of its value. In the original code, `places || 0` will return `0` only if `places` is nullish (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or `NaN`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places ? 0 : places
```
This would result in different behavior because the `?:` ternary operator will always return
