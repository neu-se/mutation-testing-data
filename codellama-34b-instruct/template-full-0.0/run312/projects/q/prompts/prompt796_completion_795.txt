  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, progressed)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the `progressed` function as the reason, rather than the original behavior of forwarding the progress notification to the `progressed` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(progressed, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the return value of the `progressed` function as the value, rather than the original behavior of forwarding the progress notification to the `progressed` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(void 0, void 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be fulfilled with `undefined` as the value, rather than the original behavior of forwarding the progress notification to the `progressed` function.

DONE.
