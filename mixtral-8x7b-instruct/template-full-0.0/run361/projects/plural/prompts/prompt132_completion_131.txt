 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].constructor.name
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor's name of the rule is equal to 'RegExp' instead of checking if the rule itself is an instance of RegExp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0] instanceof RegExp
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the rule is an instance of RegExp using the 'instanceof' operator instead of checking if the rule is a RegExp object using the 'type' function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
rule[0].test(word) || word === rule[0]
