  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
oneMinus
```
This would result in different behavior because `oneMinus` is always zero, whereas `noIM` is only zero when `a` is greater than 1 and `b` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onePlus
```
This would result in different behavior because `onePlus` is always non-zero, whereas `noIM` is only zero when `a` is equal to 1 and `b` is equal to 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.atan2(a, b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.atan2(a, b)` is always a value between 0 and 180 degrees, whereas `noIM` is only zero when `a` is greater than 1 and `b` is equal to 0.

DONE.
