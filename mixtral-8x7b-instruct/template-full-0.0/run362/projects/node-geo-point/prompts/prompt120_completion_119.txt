 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[this, 0, 0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method in the prototype is being called with a hardcoded array instead of the actual `distance` and `bearing` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[null, null, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method in the prototype is being called with `null` values instead of the actual `distance` and `bearing` values, causing potential type errors and unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
[this, this.distance, this.bearing]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `calculateDestination` method in the prototype is being called with object properties `distance` and `bearing` that do not exist in the original code fragment, causing a reference error.

DONE.
