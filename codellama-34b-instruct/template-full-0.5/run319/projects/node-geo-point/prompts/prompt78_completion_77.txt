  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is no longer being called with the correct argument, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deg2rad * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deg2rad` function is being called with a different argument, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rad2deg` function is being called with a different argument than the `deg2rad` function, which could cause the `calculateDestination` method to return incorrect results.

DONE.
