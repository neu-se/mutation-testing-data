  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop[field]
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop[field]` would return the value of the `field` property of the `prop` object, whereas `prop` would return the `prop` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `field.prop` would return the value of the `prop` property of the `field` object, whereas `prop` would return the `prop` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field.prop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `field.prop()` would call the `prop` method of the `field` object, whereas `prop` would return the `prop` object itself.

DONE.
