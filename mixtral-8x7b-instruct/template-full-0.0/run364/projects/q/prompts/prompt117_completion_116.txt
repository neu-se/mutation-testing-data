 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to the global object instead of the intended `thisp`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to the number `5` instead of the intended `thisp`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `map` callback's `this` value would be set to a new empty function instead of the intended `thisp`.

DONE.
