  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, rather than returning it as the original code fragment did.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] += options
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the `options` object to the `countries[id]` property, rather than returning it as the original code fragment did.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countries[id] = options.countries
```
This would result in different behavior because it would assign the `options.countries` object to the `countries[id]` property, rather than returning it as the original code fragment did.

DONE.
