  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s === 'object' && s.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for the length of the `s` object, which is not present in the original code fragment. This could potentially cause the test suite to fail if the length of the `s` object is not correctly handled.
