Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the second argument to the first argument, potentially altering the intended order of arguments passed to the `pull` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the expected value with `undefined`, which could lead to unexpected results or errors when the `pull` function attempts to use this value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[3] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the value by adding 1 to the fourth argument, which could change the output of the `pull` function if the fourth argument is a number, leading to incorrect behavior.

DONE.
