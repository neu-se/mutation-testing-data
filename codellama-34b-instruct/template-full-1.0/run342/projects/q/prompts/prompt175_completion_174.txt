  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `unshift` is a mutator method that adds an element at the beginning of an array, unlike `join` which concatenates all the elements of an array into a string. In the code snippet above, `desiredLines` is an array of string lines, and `join` is used to concatenate them into a single string with a newline character between each line. If `unshift` is used instead of `join`, the resulting string will have the lines in reverse order and will include an extra newline character at the beginning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
desiredLines.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is a non-destructive method that extracts a portion of an array, unlike `join` which concatenates the entire array. In the code snippet above, `desiredLines` is an array of string lines, and `slice` could be used to extract a specific range of lines from the array, for example `
