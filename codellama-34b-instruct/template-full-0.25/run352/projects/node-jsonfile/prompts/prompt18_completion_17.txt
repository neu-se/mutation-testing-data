  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFile
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise, whereas `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file directly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` is a synchronous function that returns the contents of the file directly, whereas `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function that returns a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.readFileSync('./file.txt', 'utf8')
```
This would result in different behavior because `fs.readFileSync` takes two arguments, the file path and the encoding, whereas `fs.readFile` takes only one argument, the file path.

DONE.
