  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` are not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op - args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` are not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op * args
```
This would result in different behavior because `op` and `args` are not defined in the current scope, so the code would throw a `ReferenceError`.

DONE.
