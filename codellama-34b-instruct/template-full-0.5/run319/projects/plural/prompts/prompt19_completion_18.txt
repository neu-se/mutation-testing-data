  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the letter "s" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds the letter "s" twice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the letter "s" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds the letters "ies" to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'xes' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment adds the letter "s" to the end of the word, while this new code fragment adds the letters "xes" to the end of the word.

DONE.
