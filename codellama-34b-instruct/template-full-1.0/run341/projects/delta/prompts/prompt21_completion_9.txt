  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!=` operator checks for strict inequality, while the `isEqual` function checks for deep equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && a[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `a[key] === undefined` would cause the code to only execute when `a` is missing the property `key`, while the original code fragment would execute regardless of whether `a` has the property `key` defined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key]) && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the additional condition `b[key] === undefined` would cause the code to only execute when `b` is missing the property `key`, while the original code fragment would execute regardless of whether `b`
