 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/criterium/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new rule that matches the string "criterium", which is not present in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/criterion$/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only match the string "criterion" at the end of a word, whereas the original code matches it as a standalone word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/criterion/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add a new case-insensitive rule that matches the string "criterion", whereas the original code only matches it as a standalone word in a case-sensitive manner.

DONE.
