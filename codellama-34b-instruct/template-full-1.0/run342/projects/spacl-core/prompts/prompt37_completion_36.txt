  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character (except newline) one or more times, instead of just checking if the last character is a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/.*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character (except newline) zero or more times, instead of just checking if the last character is a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\\s\\S]/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any space or non-space character, instead of just checking if the last character is a forward slash.

DONE.
