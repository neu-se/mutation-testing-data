  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but in this case, there are no arguments passed to `fcall`, so it would return `undefined`, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but in this case, `null` is passed as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be rejected instead of resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.fcall(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, but in this case, `promise` is passed as the first argument, which would cause the promise to be resolved with the value of `promise`
