  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a truthy value, even if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
messages.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return a truthy value if there are messages in the queue, but not if the promise has already been resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return a truthy value if the promise has not been resolved yet, but not if there are messages in the queue.

DONE.
