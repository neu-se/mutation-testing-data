  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the double of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates the double of `a` plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the double of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates half of `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the double of `a`, while the modified code fragment calculates three times `a`.

DONE.
