Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to `JSON.stringify` will result in the string `"null"` instead of the string representation of the object, which is the intended behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` to `JSON.stringify` will result in the string `"undefined"` instead of the string representation of the object, which is not the expected outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{...obj}
```
This would result in different behavior because using the spread operator will create a shallow copy of the object, which may lead to different string representations if the original object has properties that are not serializable or if it contains methods, thus altering the output of `JSON.stringify`.

DONE.
