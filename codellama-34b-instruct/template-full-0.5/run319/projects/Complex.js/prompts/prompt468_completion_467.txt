  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b > 0` condition would always be false, as `b` is defined as `Math.abs(b)` which is always non-negative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b <= 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b <= 0` condition would always be true, as `b` is defined as `Math.abs(b)` which is always non-negative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b !== 0` condition would always be true, as `b` is defined as `Math.abs(b)` which is always non-zero.

DONE.
