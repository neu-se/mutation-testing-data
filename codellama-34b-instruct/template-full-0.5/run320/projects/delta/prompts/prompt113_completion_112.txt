  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.filter
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `reduce` returns a single value obtained by reducing the array elements from left to right using the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array, whereas `reduce` returns a single value obtained by reducing the array elements from left to right using the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.forEach
```
This would result in different behavior because `forEach` executes a provided function once for each element of the array, whereas `reduce` returns a single value obtained by reducing the array elements from left to right using the provided function.

DONE.
