  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` variable as is, while the modified code fragment passes the uppercase version of `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` variable as is, while the modified code fragment passes `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `data` variable as is, while the modified code fragment passes the concatenation of `data` and the string `'foo'`.

DONE.
