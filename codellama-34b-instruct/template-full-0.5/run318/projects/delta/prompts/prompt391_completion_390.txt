  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next` returns the next operation, while `thisIter.next()` returns the result of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` returns the next operation, while `thisIter.next` returns the result of the next operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peek
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.peek` returns the next operation, while `thisIter.next` returns the result of the next operation.

DONE.
