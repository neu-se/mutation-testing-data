  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex.div` function to return `Complex.INFINITY` when dividing by zero, instead of `Complex.NAN`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex.div` function to return `Complex.NAN` when dividing by zero, instead of `Complex.INFINITY`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `Complex.div` function to return `Complex.NAN` when dividing by zero, instead of `Complex.INFINITY`.

DONE.
