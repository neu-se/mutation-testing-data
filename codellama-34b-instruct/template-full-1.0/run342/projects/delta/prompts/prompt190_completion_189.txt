  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a function that inserts a new operation at a specific position in the delta, whereas `push` inserts a new operation at the end of the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a function that deletes a range of operations from the delta, whereas `push` inserts a new operation at the end of the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` is a function that concatenates two deltas, whereas `push` inserts a new operation at the end of the delta.

DONE.
