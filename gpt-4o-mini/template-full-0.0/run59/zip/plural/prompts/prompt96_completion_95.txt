Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/g, 'e') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code replaces only the first occurrence of 'a' with 'e', while this code replaces all occurrences of 'a' with 'e'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/a/, 'i') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code replaces 'a' with 'e', whereas this code replaces 'a' with 'i', leading to a different pluralization result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code modifies the word based on a specific rule, while this code simply appends 'es' to the word, which may not be the correct pluralization for many words.

DONE.
