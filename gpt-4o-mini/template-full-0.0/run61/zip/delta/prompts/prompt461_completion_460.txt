Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[next].slice(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the array containing the next operation, rather than concatenating it with the remaining operations, which would lead to the loss of the rest of the operations in the returned array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the current operation at `this.index` and returns all subsequent operations, which changes the intended behavior of returning the current operation along with the rest.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rest.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the order of the operations in the returned array, which alters the sequence in which they are processed, potentially leading to incorrect results in subsequent operations.

DONE.
