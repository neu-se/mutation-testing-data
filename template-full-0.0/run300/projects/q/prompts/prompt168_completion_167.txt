  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isInternalFrame(line)` and `!isNodeFrame(line)` conditions would be evaluated first, and the `line` variable would only be evaluated if both conditions are true.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) || !isNodeFrame(line) || line
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isInternalFrame(line)` and `!isNodeFrame(line)` conditions would be evaluated first, and the `line` variable would only be evaluated if either condition is true.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isInternalFrame(line) && !isNodeFrame(line) && line
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isInternalFrame(line)` and `!isNodeFrame(line)` conditions would be evaluated first, and the `line` variable
