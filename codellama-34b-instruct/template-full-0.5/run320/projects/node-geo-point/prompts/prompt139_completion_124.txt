  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
adjust(this.longitude)
```
This would result in different behavior because `adjust` is a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a number with a specific precision. In the original code, `adjust` is called with `this.latitude`, which is a number, and the result is used to create a new `GeoPoint` object. However, if `adjust` is called with `this.longitude`, which is also a number, the result will be different and may not correspond to a valid latitude value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.longitude` is a number and adding 1 to it will result in a different value. This change would affect the calculation of the new `GeoPoint` object's longitude value, which could cause the object to represent a different location on the globe.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
