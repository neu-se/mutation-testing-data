Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === {}
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `timezonesMap` is an empty object instead of checking if it is `null` or `undefined`, which would prevent the `buildTimezonesMap` function from being called when `timezonesMap` is not initialized.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `timezonesMap` is not `null`, which would allow the `buildTimezonesMap` function to be called even if `timezonesMap` is `undefined`, potentially leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data.timezones
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `data.timezones` property is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, or an empty object) instead of checking the state of `timezonesMap`, which could lead to the `buildTimezonesMap` function not being called when it should be.

DONE.
