  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would not iterate over the lines of the delta, as the `start` variable would be initialized to 0 instead of the length of the first line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over the lines of the delta in reverse order, as the `start` variable would be initialized to -1 instead of the length of the first line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `eachLine` method would iterate over every other line of the delta, as the `start` variable would be initialized to 2 instead of the length of the first line.

DONE.
