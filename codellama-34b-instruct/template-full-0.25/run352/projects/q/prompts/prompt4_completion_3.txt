  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a function, while this replacement code fragment is a function that throws an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return 42; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a function, while this replacement code fragment is a function that returns a constant value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return function () { return 42; }; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function that returns a function, while this replacement code fragment is a function that returns a function that returns a constant value.

DONE.
