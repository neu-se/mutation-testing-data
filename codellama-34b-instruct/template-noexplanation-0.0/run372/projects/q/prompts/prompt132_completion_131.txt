  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.toLocaleString
```
This change will cause the `object_toString` function to use the `toLocaleString` method instead of the `toString` method, which may have different behavior depending on the object being passed in.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.valueOf
```
This change will cause the `object_toString` function to use the `valueOf` method instead of the `toString` method, which may have different behavior depending on the object being passed in.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
```
This change will cause the `object_toString` function to use the `hasOwnProperty` method instead of the `toString` method, which may have different behavior depending on the object being passed in.

DONE.
