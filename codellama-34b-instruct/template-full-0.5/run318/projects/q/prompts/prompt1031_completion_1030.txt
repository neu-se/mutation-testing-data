  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, value
```
This would result in different behavior because `1` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello", value
```
This would result in different behavior because `"hello"` is a different value than `null`, and the function would return a different result.

DONE.
