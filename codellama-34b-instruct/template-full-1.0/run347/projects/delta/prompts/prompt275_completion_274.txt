  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let op = otherIter.peek();
if (op && op.delete) {
  delta.push(otherIter.next());
} else {
  delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `otherIter.peek()` check is not present in the original code, which would prevent the `delta.push()` operation from occurring if the next op is a delete.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let op = otherIter.peek();
if (op && op.delete) {
  delta.retain(Op.length(thisIter.next()));
} else {
  delta.push(otherIter.next());
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of operations is reversed, with the `delta.push()` operation occurring before the `delta.retain()` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
