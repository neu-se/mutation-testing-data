  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, unlike `void 0` which is a valid function that returns `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the function expression is not a valid parameter for `then`, unlike `void 0` which is a valid parameter that indicates a no-op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because a function declaration is not a valid parameter for `then`, unlike `void 0` which is a valid parameter that indicates a no-op.

DONE.
