  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be resolved instead of rejected, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("rejected")
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error message, which could cause the test to fail even if the code is correct.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejected.then(function() { throw new Error("rejected") })
```
This would result in different behavior because the promise would be rejected with a different error message, but the rejection would be delayed until the next tick of the event loop, which could cause the test to pass even if the code is incorrect.

DONE.
