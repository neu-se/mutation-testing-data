  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, 2, 3]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing an empty array, the code would pass an array with three elements, which could cause the `Q.keys` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[[]]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing an empty array, the code would pass an array with another empty array as its only element, which could cause the `Q.keys` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
["foo"]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of passing an empty array, the code would pass an array with a string "foo" as its only element, which could cause the `Q.keys` function to behave differently.

DONE.
