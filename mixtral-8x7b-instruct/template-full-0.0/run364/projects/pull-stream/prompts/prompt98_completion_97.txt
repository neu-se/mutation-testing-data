 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.exit(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function would not receive the error and call the second callback function, instead, the process would be terminated.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the callback function, which is expected to be the data, is not provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.error(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be logged to the console instead of being passed to the callback function.

DONE.
