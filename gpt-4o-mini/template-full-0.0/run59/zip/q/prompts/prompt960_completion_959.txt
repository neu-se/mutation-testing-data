Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the source of the arguments passed to the function, potentially leading to incorrect behavior if `nodeArgs` is not properly populated or is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the original arguments with an empty array, causing the function to be called without any arguments, which may lead to unexpected results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes `null` instead of the original arguments, which could cause the function to fail or behave incorrectly if it expects an array of arguments.

DONE.
