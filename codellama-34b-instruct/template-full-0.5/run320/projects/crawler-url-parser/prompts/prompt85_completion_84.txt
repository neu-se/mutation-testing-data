  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trimRight(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimRight()` would remove characters from the right side of the string, whereas `trim()` removes characters from both sides.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trimLeft(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because `trimLeft()` would remove characters from the left side of the string, whereas `trim()` removes characters from both sides.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim(1);
```
This would result in different behavior because `trim()` would remove only one character from both sides of the string, whereas the original code removes all characters from both sides.

DONE.
