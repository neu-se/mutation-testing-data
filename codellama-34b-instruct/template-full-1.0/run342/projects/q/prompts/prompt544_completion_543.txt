  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null === StopIteration` condition would never be true, leading to the async function never being called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined === StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined === StopIteration` condition would always be true, leading to the async function never being called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isStopIteration !== StopIteration
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isStopIteration !== StopIteration` condition would always be true, leading to the async function never being called.

DONE.
