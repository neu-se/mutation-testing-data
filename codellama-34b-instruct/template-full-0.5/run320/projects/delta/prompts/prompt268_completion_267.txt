  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(newOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `newOp` object to the `delta` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `concat` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(otherOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the `otherOp` object to the `delta` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `concat` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(delta.ops[0]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the first element of the `delta.ops` array to the `delta` array, which is not the intended behavior of the `concat` method.

DONE.
