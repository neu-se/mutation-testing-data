  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be removed, causing the condition to be negated, resulting in the opposite behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be replaced with a comparison to `false`, causing the condition to be negated, resulting in the opposite behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
trackUnhandledRejections !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would be replaced with a comparison to `true`, causing the condition to be negated, resulting in the opposite behavior.

DONE.
