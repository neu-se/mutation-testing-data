  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the wrong property, resulting in a different value for the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['abs']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the wrong property, resulting in a different value for the `Math.cos()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['arg']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the wrong variable, resulting in a different value for the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
