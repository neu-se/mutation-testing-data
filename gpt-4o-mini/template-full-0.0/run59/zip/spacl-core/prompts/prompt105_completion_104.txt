Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'unknownPolicy'
```
This would result in different behavior because it will always attempt to retrieve a policy with the name 'unknownPolicy', which will likely not exist, leading to a return value of `false` regardless of the actual policy name passed to the `matches` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name + 'Extra'
```
This would result in different behavior because it modifies the `name` by appending 'Extra', which will cause the method to look for a policy with a name that does not match the original input, likely resulting in a return value of `false` if the modified name does not exist in the collection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it converts the `name` to uppercase before attempting to retrieve the policy, which may not match the actual case of the policy names stored in the `PolicyMap`, potentially leading to a return value of `false` if the names are case-sensitive.

DONE.
