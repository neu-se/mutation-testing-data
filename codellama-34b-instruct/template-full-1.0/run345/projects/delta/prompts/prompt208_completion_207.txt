  Sure, here are three options with different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.compose(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because compose() method combines two Delta instances, which may not be the desired behavior in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.concat(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because concat() method simply adds two Delta instances, which may not give the desired result in this case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.diff(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because diff() method calculates the difference between two Delta instances, which may not be the desired result in this case.

DONE.
