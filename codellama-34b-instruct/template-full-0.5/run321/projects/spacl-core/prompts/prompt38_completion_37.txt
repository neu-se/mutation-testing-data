  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string by `/` and returns all elements except the first one, whereas this replacement code fragment splits the `spec` string by `/` and returns all elements starting from the second one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string by `/` and returns all elements except the last one, whereas this replacement code fragment splits the `spec` string by `/` and returns all elements starting from the first one up to and including the second-to-last element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1).reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string by `/` and returns all elements except the first one
