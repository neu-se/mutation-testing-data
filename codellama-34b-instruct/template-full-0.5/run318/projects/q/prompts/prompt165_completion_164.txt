  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one additional iteration, potentially accessing an index that is out of bounds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i > lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute at all, and the function would return `undefined` instead of an array of filtered lines.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i !== lines.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one fewer iteration, potentially omitting a line that should be included in the filtered array.

DONE.
