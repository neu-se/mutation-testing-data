  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object, while the replaced code fragment returns null, which would cause an error if it is not properly handled by the rest of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Delta()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with a different set of operations, while the replaced code fragment returns a new empty Delta object, which would not have the same behavior as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
concat
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a new Delta object with the concatenated operations of the current object and another Delta object, while the replaced code fragment returns a new Delta object with the concatenated operations of the current object and a string, which would have a different result.

DONE.
