 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends './' to the targetFilePath, which might not be desired and could cause issues if the path is relative.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
process.cwd() + '/' + targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because it prepends the current working directory to the targetFilePath, which might not be desired and could cause issues if the path is relative.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.resolve(targetFilePath)
