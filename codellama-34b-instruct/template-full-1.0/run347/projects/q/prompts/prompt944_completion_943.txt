  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[method].apply(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a nodeback function, while this replacement code uses `object[method]` directly, which could cause issues if `method` is not a function or if `object[method]` is not a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[method].call(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` expects a `this` value as its first argument, while `apply` expects an array of arguments as its first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return object[method].bind(object, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function with a fixed `this` value and arguments, while `apply` and `call` invoke a function with a specified `this` value and arguments.

DONE.
