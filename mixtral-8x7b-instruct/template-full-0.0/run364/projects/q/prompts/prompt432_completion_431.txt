 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
"pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `true` for pending promises, which is incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `true` when the promise is pending, which is incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isRejected` function would return `true` when the promise is pending, which is incorrect.

By changing the PLACEHOLDER to any of the above options, the `isRejected` function would return incorrect results, indicating that the test suite may not be effectively testing this function.

DONE.
