 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackRejection(null, reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to track rejection with a null promise, which may not have the desired effect and could potentially cause errors if the `trackRejection` function is not designed to handle null values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.push(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the reason into the `unhandledRejections` array instead of pushing the promise, which may cause unexpected behavior in the rest of the code that relies on the array containing promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
trackRejection(promise, unhandledReasons);
```
This would result in different behavior because it passes the `unhandledReasons` array instead of the `reason` variable as the second argument to the `trackRejection` function, which may cause unexpected behavior since the function likely expects a
