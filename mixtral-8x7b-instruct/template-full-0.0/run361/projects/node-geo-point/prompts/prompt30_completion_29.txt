 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 * point2.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always treat the longitude difference as a positive value, ignoring the actual direction.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.atan(r > 1 ? 1 : r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `atan` function instead of `acos`, which would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.asin(r)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `asin` function instead of `acos`, which would lead to incorrect distance calculations.

By introducing these changes, the mutation testing aims to uncover potential issues in the test suite, encouraging developers to improve their tests and ensure better code coverage.

DONE.
