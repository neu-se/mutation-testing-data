  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring` would return a substring of the original word, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the specified index, and continuing to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substring(0, w.length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.substring(0, w.length - 1)` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the beginning, and continuing to the second-to-last character, whereas `w.substr` would return a substring of the original word, starting from the specified index, and continuing to the end of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `w.slice(0, -1)` would return a substring of the original word, starting
