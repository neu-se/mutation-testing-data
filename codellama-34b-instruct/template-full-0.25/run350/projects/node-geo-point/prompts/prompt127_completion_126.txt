  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the longitude value of the `point` object, which may not be the same as the longitude value of the `coordinate` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
coordinate.longitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 to the longitude value of the `coordinate` object, which may not be the same as the longitude value of the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * 360 - 180
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random longitude value between -180 and 180, which may not be the same as the longitude value of the `point` object.

DONE.
