  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` case to be treated as a `delete` case, leading to incorrect behavior in the `retain` branch of the `if` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'retain'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` case to be treated as a `delete` case, leading to incorrect behavior in the `retain` branch of the `if` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.delete || op.retain === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `retain` case to be treated as an `insert` case, leading to incorrect behavior in the `retain` branch of the `if` statement.

DONE.
