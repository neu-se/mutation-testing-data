  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- cb
+ cb++
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb` is a function that takes two arguments, but `cb++` would attempt to increment the function as though it were a variable, resulting in a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- cb
+ cb.apply(this, [])
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.apply(this, [])` would attempt to call the `cb` function with the wrong context (the `this` value would be different than expected).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```diff
- cb
+ cb.call(null, )
```
This would result in different behavior because `cb.call(null, )` would attempt to call the `cb` function with the wrong context (the `this` value would be `null` instead of the expected object).

DONE.
