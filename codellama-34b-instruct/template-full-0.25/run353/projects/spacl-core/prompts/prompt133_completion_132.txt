  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice()` returns a shallow copy of the array, whereas `this.verbs` returns the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.map(verb => !verb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `map()` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the original array, whereas `this.verbs` returns the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.verbs.filter(verb => verb === 'GET')
```
This would result in different behavior because `filter()` returns a new array with the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `this.verbs` returns the original array.

DONE.
