  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.splice
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` creates a shallow copy of part of an array, while `splice` removes elements from the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.reduce
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of part of an array, while `reduce` returns a new array that results from applying a function to every element of the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.prototype.map
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of part of an array, while `map` returns a new array that results from applying a function to every element of the original array.

DONE.
