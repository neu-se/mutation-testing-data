  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[point.longitude, point.latitude]
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude and latitude values would be swapped, causing a different point to be returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[point.latitude * 2, point.longitude * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be multiplied by 2, causing a different point to be returned.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[point.latitude + 10, point.longitude + 10]
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude and longitude values would be increased by 10, causing a different point to be returned.

DONE.
