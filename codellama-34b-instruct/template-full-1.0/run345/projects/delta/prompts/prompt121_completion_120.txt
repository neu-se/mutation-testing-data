  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array of ops would be one less, which would cause the slice method to skip over the last element in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array of ops would be one more, which would cause the slice method to include an extra element in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the array of ops would be double what it should be, which would cause the slice method to include two extra elements in the array.

DONE.
