  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is not called, which would prevent the archive from being finalized and written to the output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a `null` argument, which would cause the archive to be finalized with an empty comment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize("This is a test comment");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a comment, which would cause the archive to be finalized with a different comment than the original code.

DONE.
