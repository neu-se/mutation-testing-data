  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len <= pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat subdomains of the same domain as being at the same level rather than one level above.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len > pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat subdomains of the same domain as being at one level above rather than the same level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_subdomain_len != pageurl_subdomain_len
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat subdomains of different domains as being at the same level rather than one level above.

DONE.
