  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one more time than necessary, potentially leading to an infinite loop or an out-of-range error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate one fewer time than necessary, potentially leading to an incorrect result or a missing iteration.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next(end - index + 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to iterate two more times than necessary, potentially leading to an infinite loop or an out-of-range error.

DONE.
