 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to resolve the dest as a relative path from the current directory instead of using the absolute path based on the `__dirname` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
process.cwd()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the current working directory as the base for the dest path, which might not be the same as the module's directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would generate a random number, which would not be a valid directory path. This would cause the `path.join()` method to throw an exception, changing the normal flow of the function.

DONE.
