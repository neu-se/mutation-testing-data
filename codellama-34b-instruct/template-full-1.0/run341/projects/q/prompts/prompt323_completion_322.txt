  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise(null)` would return a rejected promise, while `promise, args` would return a resolved promise with the `args` as the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(args)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then(args)` would return a promise that resolves to the `args` value after `promise` has been fulfilled.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0].promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `args[0].promise` would return a promise that resolves to the first element of `args` value, while `promise, args` would return a resolved promise with `args` as the value.

DONE.
