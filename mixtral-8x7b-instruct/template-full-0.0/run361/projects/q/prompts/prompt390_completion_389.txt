 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return rejected.apply(this, arguments); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the context (`this`) and arguments of the `rejected` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it always creates a new rejected promise instead of using the provided `rejected` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because it references the outer `reject` function instead of the `rejected` function provided as an argument.

DONE.
