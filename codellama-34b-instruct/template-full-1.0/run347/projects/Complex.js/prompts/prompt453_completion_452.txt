  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.re - this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the real part of `z` with the imaginary part of `this`, rather than comparing the imaginary part of `z` with the imaginary part of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.im + this.re
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be adding the imaginary part of `z` to the real part of `this`, rather than subtracting the imaginary part of `z` from the imaginary part of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z.conjugate().im - this.im
```
This would result in different behavior because it would be comparing the imaginary part of the conjugate of `z` with the imaginary part of `this`, rather than comparing the imaginary part of `z` with the imaginary part of `this`.

DONE.
