  Here are three possible options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const dstOffsetStr = `<PLACEHOLDER>(dstOffset + 1)`;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 hour to the DST offset, which would be incorrect if the DST offset is 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const dstOffsetStr = `<PLACEHOLDER>(dstOffset - 1)`;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract 1 hour from the DST offset, which would be incorrect if the DST offset is 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
    const dstOffsetStr = `<PLACEHOLDER>(utcOffset + 1)`;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add 1 hour to the UTC offset, which would be incorrect if the UTC offset is 0.

DONE.
