  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the wrong operation name, which would cause the method to return a promise for the wrong value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the wrong operation name, which would cause the method to return a promise for the wrong value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dispatch` method would be called with the wrong operation name, which would cause the method to return a promise for the wrong value.

DONE.
