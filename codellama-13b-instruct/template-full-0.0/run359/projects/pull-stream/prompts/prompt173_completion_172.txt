  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length` property is not the same as the `Array.isArray` function, which checks if an object is an array. The `array.length` property returns the number of elements in the array, which can be different from the number of keys in an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(array).length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.keys(array).length` expression returns the number of keys in the object, which can be different from the number of elements in the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `array.length > 0` expression checks if the array has any elements, which can be different from the `Array.isArray` function, which checks if an object is an array.

DONE.
