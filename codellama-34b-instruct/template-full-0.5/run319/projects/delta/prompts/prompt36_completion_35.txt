  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
priority
```
This would result in different behavior because `priority` is a truthy value, so the expression `!priority` would always evaluate to `false`, regardless of the value of `priority`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority || !b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `b` if `priority` is falsy and `b` is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!priority && !b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `b` if `priority` and `b` are both falsy.

DONE.
