  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"rejectionHandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, so the code would not handle the unhandled rejection correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "Handled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with a string, so the code would not handle the unhandled rejection correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"unhandledRejection" + "Unhandled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is concatenated with a string, so the code would not handle the unhandled rejection correctly.

DONE.
