  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/+/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator matches one or more occurrences of the preceding token, whereas the original code fragment matches exactly two forward slashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/*/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding token, whereas the original code fragment matches exactly two forward slashes.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\/\/|/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `|` operator matches either the expression before or after it, whereas the original code fragment matches exactly two forward slashes.

DONE.
