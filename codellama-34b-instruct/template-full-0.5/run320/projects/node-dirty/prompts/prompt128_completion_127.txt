  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.uncork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `uncork` method is called on the write stream, which would allow data to be written to the stream immediately, rather than being buffered. This could cause the data to be written to the file in a different order or at a different time than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.end();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `end` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to close and no more data can be written to it. This could cause the program to fail or behave unexpectedly if it tries to write more data to the stream after it has been closed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `destroy` method is called on the write stream, which would cause the stream to be closed and destroyed. This could cause the program to
