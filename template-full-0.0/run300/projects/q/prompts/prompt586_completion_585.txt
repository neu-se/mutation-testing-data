  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator)()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `makeGenerator` function immediately, rather than passing it as an argument to `Q.async`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function* () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new generator function that does nothing, rather than passing the `makeGenerator` function as an argument to `Q.async`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that does nothing, rather than passing the `makeGenerator` function as an argument to `Q.async`.

DONE.
