  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout + 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be increased by 1000 milliseconds.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout - 1000
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be decreased by 1000 milliseconds.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timeout * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the delay would be doubled.

DONE.
