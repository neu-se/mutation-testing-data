  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!isNaN` operator would invert the result of the `isNaN` function, causing the `if` statement to execute even if `z['im']` is not a NaN, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Number.isNaN` function is similar to the `isNaN` function, but it checks if the given value is a number, unlike `isNaN`, which can check if a value is of any data type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.is
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Object.is` function checks if two objects are the same, unlike `isNaN`, which checks if a value is not a number.

DONE.
