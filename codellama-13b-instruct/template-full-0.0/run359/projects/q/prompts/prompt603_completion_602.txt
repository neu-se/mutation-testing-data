  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` keyword is used to defer the execution of a function until the next turn of the event loop, whereas the original code fragment `defer` is a variable that is not defined in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer()` function is used to create a new deferred object, whereas the original code fragment `defer` is a variable that is not defined in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.nextTick()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.nextTick()` function is used to schedule a function to be executed on the next turn of the event loop, whereas the original code fragment `defer` is a variable that is not defined in the code.

DONE.
