  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's'; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function always returns the input word unchanged, while this new function adds an 's' to the end of the word.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -1); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function always returns the input word unchanged, while this new function removes the last character of the word.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.replace(/s$/, ''); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original function always returns the input word unchanged, while this new function removes any 's' characters from the end of the word.

DONE.
