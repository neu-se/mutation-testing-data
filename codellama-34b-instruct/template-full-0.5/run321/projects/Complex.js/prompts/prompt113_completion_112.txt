  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this != Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` and `Complex` are not the same object, even if they have the same properties and methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor !== Complex
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor` and `Complex` are not the same constructor function, even if they have the same properties and methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.constructor.name !== 'Complex'
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.constructor.name` and `'Complex'` are not the same string, even if they have the same value.

DONE.
