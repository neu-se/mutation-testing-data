  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end
```
This would result in different behavior because `end` is a boolean value, and `!end` is a negation of that value. If `end` is true, `!end` would be false, and vice versa. In the original code, `!end` is used to check if the stream has ended, and if it has, the `onEnd` function is called. If `end` is replaced with `end`, the `onEnd` function would not be called, and the stream would not be properly closed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because `true` is a boolean value that is always true, regardless of the value of `end`. In the original code, `!end` is used to check if the stream has ended, and if it has, the `onEnd` function is called. If `end` is replaced with `true`, the `onEnd` function would be called every time, regardless of whether the stream has ended or not.
