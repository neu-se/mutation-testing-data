  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `other` delta's operations even if they are not of type `insert`, which could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the `transform` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'insert' && thisIter.peekType() !== 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `other` delta's operations even if they are not of type `insert`, and it would also cause the `while` loop to iterate over the `this` delta's operations even if they are not of type `insert`, which could lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in the `transform` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in
