  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `length` property of an array, which is a non-zero integer, while the replaced code is using the `0` value, which is a falsy value, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` and the `untrackRejection` function would not be called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `length` property of an array, which is a non-zero integer, while the replaced code is using the `-1` value, which is a negative integer, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` and the `untrackRejection` function would be called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is using the `length` property of an array, which is a non-zero integer, while the
