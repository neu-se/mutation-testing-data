  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is called with an argument of `1` instead of the expected `undefined`. This would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(null));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is called with an argument of `null` instead of the expected `undefined`. This would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause the program to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver(true));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function is called with an argument of `true` instead of the expected `undefined
