  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all()
```
This would result in different behavior because `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise for an array of states from the original array of promises, while `all` is a method that returns a promise for the fulfillment value of the first promise that is fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.any()
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a method that returns a promise for the first resolved promise from the original array of promises, while `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise for an array of states from the original array of promises.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.then()
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a method that returns a promise for the resolution of the original promise, while `allSettled` is a method that returns a promise for an array of states from the original array of promises.

DONE.
