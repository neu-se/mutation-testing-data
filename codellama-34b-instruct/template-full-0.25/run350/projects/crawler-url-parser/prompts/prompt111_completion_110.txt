  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http", "https")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace the first occurrence of "http" with "https", which would change the URL protocol from HTTP to HTTPS.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("www.", "")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove the "www." subdomain from the URL, which could change the domain name and potentially the website's content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("://", "://www.")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would add the "www." subdomain to the URL, which could change the domain name and potentially the website's content.

DONE.
