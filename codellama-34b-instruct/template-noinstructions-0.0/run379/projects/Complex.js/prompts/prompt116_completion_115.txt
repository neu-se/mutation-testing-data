  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `z` variable, which is used in the `Complex` constructor to set the `re` and `im` properties of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `z` variable, which is used in the `Complex` constructor to set the `re` and `im` properties of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `parse` function to return a different value for the `z` variable, which is used in the `Complex` constructor to set the `re` and `im` properties of the complex number.

DONE.
