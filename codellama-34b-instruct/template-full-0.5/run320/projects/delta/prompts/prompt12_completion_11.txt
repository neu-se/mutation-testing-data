  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== null && b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined`, but this code checks for `null`. If `a[key]` is `null`, the original code would consider it as defined, but this code would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined || b[key] === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for both `undefined` and `null`, but this code only checks for `undefined`. If `a[key]` is `null`, the original code would consider it as defined, but this code would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined && b[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `undefined` in both `a[key]` and `b[key]`, but this code only checks for `undefined` in `a
