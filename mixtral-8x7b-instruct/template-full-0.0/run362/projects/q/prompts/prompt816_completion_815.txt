 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Manually rejected'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would now throw an error instead of doing nothing when no arguments are provided.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error('Manually rejected'))
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would now return a rejected promise with a custom error instead of doing nothing when no arguments are provided.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `done` method would now return `null` instead of doing nothing when no arguments are provided. This could cause issues if the developers are relying on the returned promise to be the same as the input promise.

DONE.
