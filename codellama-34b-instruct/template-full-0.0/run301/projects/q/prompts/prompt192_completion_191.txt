  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the first word of the stack line, which may not be the file name.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the last word of the stack line, which may not be the file name.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.split(" ").slice(1).join(" ")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the second and subsequent words of the stack line, which may not be the file name.

DONE.
