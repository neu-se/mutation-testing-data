  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always add 1 to the result of the `descriptor[op]` expression, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always multiply the result of the `descriptor[op]` expression by 2, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op] - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always subtract 1 from the result of the `descriptor[op]` expression, which could cause the `promiseDispatch` function to behave differently.

DONE.
