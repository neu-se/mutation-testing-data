  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, and would likely cause a runtime error if the placeholder is used as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, and would likely cause a runtime error if the placeholder is used as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { return null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the placeholder would now return a function that returns null, which would likely cause a runtime error if the returned value is expected to be a different type.

DONE.
