  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expected `read` to be a function, but `0` is a number and not a function, so it would throw a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
read+0
```
This would result in different behavior because `read+0` would be a string concatenation, not a function call, and would return the result of concatenating the string `read` with the string `0`, rather than calling the function `read` with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
read.bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read.bind(null)` would return a new function with `null` as `this` context, whereas the original code expected a function with `read` as `this` context.

DONE.
