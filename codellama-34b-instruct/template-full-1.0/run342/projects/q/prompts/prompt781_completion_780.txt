  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless
```
This would result in different behavior because `regardless` is a function that takes a promise as argument and returns a new promise that is resolved when the given promise is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.state
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.state` is a property that returns the current state of the promise, which can be either "fulfilled", "rejected" or "pending".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return "fulfilled"; }, function() { return "rejected"; }, function() { return "pending"; })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.then` is a function that takes up to three arguments, and returns a new promise that is resolved when the given promise is resolved, rejected, or pending, respectively.

DONE.
