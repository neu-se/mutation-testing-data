  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would not check if `error` is an object or if it is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack &&
        error.stack.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would also check if the `error.stack` property is not empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
hasStacks &&
        promise.stack &&
        typeof error === "object" &&
        error !== null &&
        error.stack &&
        error.stack.length > 0 &&
        error.stack.indexOf("From previous event:") === -1
```
This would result in
