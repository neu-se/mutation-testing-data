  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a less-than operator, while this code uses a less-than-or-equal-to operator. This would cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a less-than operator, while this code uses a greater-than operator. This would cause the loop to never iterate, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index != end && iter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses a less-than operator, while this code uses a not-equal operator. This would cause the loop to iterate one extra time if the index is equal to the end, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.
