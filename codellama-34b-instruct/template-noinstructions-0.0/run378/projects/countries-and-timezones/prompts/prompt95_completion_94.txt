  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === null` is a different condition than `!country`, which checks for the existence of the `country` variable. If `country` is `null`, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return an object with the `timezones` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `country === undefined` is a different condition than `!country`, which checks for the existence of the `country` variable. If `country` is `undefined`, the original code would return `null`, but the mutated code would return an object with the `timezones` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
country.timezones === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `country.timezones === null` is a different condition than `!country`, which checks for the existence of the `country`
