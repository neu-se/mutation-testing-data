  Option 1:
```
urlMap.delete(url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `delete` method is used to remove an element from an object, but `urlMap` is a `Map` object and the `delete` method should be used to remove the key-value pair from the map.

Option 2:
```
urlMap.clear();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `clear` method is used to remove all elements from an object, but it would also remove the `domain` property from `baseUrl` which is likely not intended.

Option 3:
```
urlMap.remove(url);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `remove` method is not a valid method on `Map` objects. Instead, the `delete` method should be used to remove a key-value pair from the map.

DONE.
