 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort callback would not be called when the input `array` is falsy, which is different from the original behavior of calling the abort callback with the `onAbort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort callback would not be called when the input `array` is falsy, and it would also not pass any argument to the callback function, which is different from the original behavior of calling the abort callback with the `onAbort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i
```
This would result in different behavior because the abort callback would be called with the loop variable `i` instead of the `onAbort` argument, which would cause unexpected behavior when the input `array` is not empty.

DONE.
