  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected, even if the function call was successful.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.resolve, deferred.reject);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with the result of the function call, even if the function call failed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(bound).fapply(nodeArgs).then(deferred.reject, deferred.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with the error thrown by the function call, even if the function call was successful.

DONE.
