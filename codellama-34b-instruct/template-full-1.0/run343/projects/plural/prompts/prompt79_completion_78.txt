  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'gers'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/.*s$/` matches any string that ends with "s", but it does not match strings that end with "ges".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'ze'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/.*e$/` matches any string that ends with "e", but it does not match strings that end with "ze".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'xes'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/.*x$/` matches any string that ends with "x", but it does not match strings that end with "xes".

DONE.
