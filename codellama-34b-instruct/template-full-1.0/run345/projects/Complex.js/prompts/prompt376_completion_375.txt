  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the square root of `1 - 1 / c^2`, which is a complex number, while the modified code is calculating the square root of `1 - 1 / (a + b)^2`, which is a real number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the square root of `1 - 1 / c^2`, which is a complex number, while the modified code is calculating the square root of `1 - 1 / (-a + b)^2`, which is a real number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is calculating the square root of `1 - 1 / c^2`, which is a complex number, while the modified code is calculating the square root of `1 - 1 / (a
