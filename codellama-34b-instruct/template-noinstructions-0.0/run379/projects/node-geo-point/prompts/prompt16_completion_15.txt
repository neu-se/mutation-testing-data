  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the first element of the array, instead of the entire array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return the second element of the array, instead of the entire array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fromLngLatArray.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all elements of the original array except the first one, instead of the entire array.

DONE.
