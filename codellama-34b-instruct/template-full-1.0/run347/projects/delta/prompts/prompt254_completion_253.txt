  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(4);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of characters retained, potentially breaking the logic of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peek();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of characters retained, potentially breaking the logic of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.reverse();
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the characters retained, potentially breaking the logic of the code.

DONE.
