  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` is a bound function that returns a new function with the `this` context set to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method on the `this` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method on the `this` object with `this` as the `this` context, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the `dispatch` method on the `this` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method on the `this` object with `this` as the `this` context and
