  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a syntax error, as the `dispatch` method is not defined on the `Promise.prototype` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.dispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an infinite loop, as the `dispatch` method would call itself indefinitely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.prototype.dispatch.apply
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error, as the `apply` method is not defined on the `dispatch` method.

DONE.
