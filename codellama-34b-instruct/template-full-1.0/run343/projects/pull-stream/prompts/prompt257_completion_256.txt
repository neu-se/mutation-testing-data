  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(!err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the then branch if `err` is truthy, while the modified code fragment executes the then branch if `err` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(err === null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the then branch if `err` is a non-null reference, while the modified code fragment executes the then branch if `err` is a null reference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if(!!err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only executes the then branch if `err` is truthy, while the modified code fragment executes the then branch if `err` is truthy or falsy.

DONE.
