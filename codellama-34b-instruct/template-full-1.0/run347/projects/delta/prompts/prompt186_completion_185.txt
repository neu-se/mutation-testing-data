  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is null, which means it will only push the `otherOp` if `thisOp.retain` is null. However, if we replace it with `thisOp.retain != null`, it will push `otherOp` if `thisOp.retain` is not null, which could lead to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `thisOp.retain` is an object, which means it will only push the `otherOp` if `thisOp.retain` is an object. However, if we replace it with `typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'`, it will push `otherOp` if `thisOp.retain` is not an object, which could lead to different behavior.

Option 3: The PL
