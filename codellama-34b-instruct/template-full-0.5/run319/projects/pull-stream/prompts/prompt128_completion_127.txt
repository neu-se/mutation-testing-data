  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i > max`, but the new code fragment returns `false` regardless of the value of `i`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i > max`, but the new code fragment returns `true` if `i < max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i >= max
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns `true` if `i > max`, but the new code fragment returns `true` if `i >= max`.

DONE.
