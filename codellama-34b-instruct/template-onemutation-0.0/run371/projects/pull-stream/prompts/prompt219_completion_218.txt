  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` is a function call, while `null` is a null value. The function call would pass the result of the `map` function to the `cb` function, while `null` would pass a null value to the `cb` function.

DONE.
