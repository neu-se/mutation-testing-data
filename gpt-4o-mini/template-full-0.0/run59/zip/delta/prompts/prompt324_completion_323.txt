Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly subtract the length from the base index, potentially leading to an invalid index that could cause errors or unexpected results when slicing the base.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increment the base index by 1, which could lead to skipping over elements in the base when slicing, resulting in missing operations or incorrect transformations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + op.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `op.retain` instead of `length`, which could lead to incorrect indexing if `op.retain` does not match the expected length of the operations being processed, potentially causing out-of-bounds errors or incorrect slices.

DONE.
