  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.makeNodeResolver()
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.makeNodeResolver()` is a function that returns a new node resolver object, which is not the same as the `defer` object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer.promise` is a promise object, which is not the same as the `defer` object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that returns a new defer object, which is not the same as the `defer` object itself.

DONE.
