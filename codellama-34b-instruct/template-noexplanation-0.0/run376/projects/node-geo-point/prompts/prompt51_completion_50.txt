  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude - point1.latitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value, as it will be using the latitude instead of the longitude to calculate the bearing.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude + point1.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value, as it will be adding the longitudes instead of subtracting them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2.longitude * point1.longitude
```
This change will cause the `calculateBearing` method to return an incorrect value, as it will be multiplying the longitudes instead of subtracting them.

DONE.
