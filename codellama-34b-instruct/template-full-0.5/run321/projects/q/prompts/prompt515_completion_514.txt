  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (name === null || name === void 0) {
    return value.apply(void 0, args);
} else {
    return value[name].apply(value, args);
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the behavior of the `post` method, which is used to apply a promised function. The original code fragment would apply the function with the given arguments, while the modified code fragment would apply the function with the given arguments, but only if the `name` parameter is `null` or `undefined`.
