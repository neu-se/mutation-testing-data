  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string `str` contains any illegal characters, while the modified code fragment checks the length of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string `str` contains any illegal characters, while the modified code fragment checks if the lowercase version of the string contains any illegal characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
str.split("").reverse().join("")
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the string `str` contains any illegal characters, while the modified code fragment checks if the reversed version of the string contains any illegal characters.

DONE.
