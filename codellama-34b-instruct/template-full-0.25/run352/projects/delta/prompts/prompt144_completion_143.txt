  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `length` elements, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by `length` elements in the other delta, potentially skipping over important operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.push(thisIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the next operation from the current delta onto the `delta` array, potentially causing the delta to grow in size.

DONE.
