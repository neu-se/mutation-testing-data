  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
regardless++
```
This would result in different behavior because the `regardless` variable would be incremented, leading to a different value being returned by the `promise.inspect()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.inspect()` method would return `null` instead of the expected `regardless` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `promise.inspect()` method would throw an error, causing the `allSettled` method to reject the promise.

DONE.
