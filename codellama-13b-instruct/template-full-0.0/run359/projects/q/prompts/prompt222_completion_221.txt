  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not defined in the original code, and the `defer.prototype` property is not accessible.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not defined in the original code, and the `defer.prototype.promise` property is not accessible.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.prototype.promise.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer` function is not defined in the original code, and the `defer.prototype.promise.promiseDispatch` property is not accessible.

DONE.
