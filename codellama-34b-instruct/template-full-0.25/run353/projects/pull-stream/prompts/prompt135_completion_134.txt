  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function without passing any arguments, while this new code fragment passes the `err` argument to the `cb` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, err)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment passes two arguments to the `cb` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(err, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `cb` function with a single argument, while this new code fragment passes two arguments to the `cb` function in a different order.

DONE.
