Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the arguments array, causing the first argument to be omitted when invoking the method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the starting index for the arguments array, causing the first argument to be included and potentially altering the method's expected input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it evaluates to `3`, which would cause the method to receive an incorrect number of arguments, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors during execution.

DONE.
