  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude of the destination point would be calculated using the latitude of the starting point, rather than the latitude of the destination point.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude of the destination point would be calculated using the longitude of the starting point, rather than the longitude of the destination point.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
λ2
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude of the destination point would be calculated using the longitude of the starting point, rather than the longitude of the destination point.

DONE.
