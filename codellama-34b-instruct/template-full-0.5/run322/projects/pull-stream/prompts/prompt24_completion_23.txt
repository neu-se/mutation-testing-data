  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use the second argument instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use a different value for the first argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref[1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the function to use a different value for the first argument.

DONE.
