  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, !data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the value of `data`, which would cause the `mapper` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property of `data` is being accessed, which would cause the `mapper` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, data[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` array is being accessed at index 0, which would cause the `mapper` function to be called with a different argument than the original code.

DONE.
