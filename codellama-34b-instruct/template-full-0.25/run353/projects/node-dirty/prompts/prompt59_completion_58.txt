  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(new Error('Dummy error'));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called with an error, which would trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would not emit any errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called with a null value, which would not trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would emit an error if the `close` method was called with an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.close(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `close` method to be called with an undefined value, which would not trigger the `error` event to be emitted, whereas the original code would emit an error if the `close` method was called with an error.
