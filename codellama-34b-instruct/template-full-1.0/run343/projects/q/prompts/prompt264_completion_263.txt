  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because if the promise is rejected, the `become` method would be called with a rejected promise, which would change the behavior of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw Error
```
This would result in different behavior because if an error is thrown, the `become` method would not be called, and the promise would be rejected with that error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>
```
This would result in different behavior because if a new promise is created and returned, the `become` method would be called with that promise, which would change the behavior of the code.

DONE.
