  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.toString()` would return the string representation of the object, whereas `obj` would return the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.valueOf()` would return the primitive value of the object, whereas `obj` would return the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')
```
This would result in different behavior because `obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')` would return a boolean indicating whether the object has a `toString` property, whereas `obj` would return the object itself.

DONE.
