  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[value, key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments is reversed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value argument is incremented by 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value argument is multiplied by 2.

DONE.
