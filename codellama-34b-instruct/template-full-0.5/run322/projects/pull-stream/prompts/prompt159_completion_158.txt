  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original value, while the modified code fragment returns the original value plus one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original value, while the modified code fragment returns the original value plus one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the original value, while the modified code fragment returns the original value minus one.

DONE.
