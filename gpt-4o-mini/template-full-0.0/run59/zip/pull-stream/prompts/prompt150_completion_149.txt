Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now execute the `abortCb` function when `abort` is falsy (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, `0`, `false`), which is the opposite of the original logic that executes it when `abort` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort === false
```
This would result in different behavior because it will only call `abortCb` when `abort` is explicitly `false`, ignoring other falsy values like `null` or `undefined`, which would not trigger the abort callback in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because it will now execute the `abortCb` function when `abort` is anything other than `true`, which could lead to unintended executions of the callback when `abort` is `false`, `null`, or any other value.

DONE.
