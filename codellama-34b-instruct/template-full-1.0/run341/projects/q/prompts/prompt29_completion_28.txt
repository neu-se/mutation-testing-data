  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the loop would continue as long as the `laterQueue.length` is truthy, but in this version, it would only continue if the queue is not empty, which would cause the loop to terminate early if the queue becomes empty during execution of the loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the loop would continue as long as the `laterQueue.length` is truthy, but in this version, it would only continue if the queue is empty, which would cause the loop to execute only if the queue was empty to begin with.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
laterQueue.splice(0, 1).length
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the loop would continue as long as the `laterQueue
