  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens = [];
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is null, while this replacement always sets `tokens` to an empty array, which would cause the loop to execute even if the `tokens` array is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is null, while this replacement checks if the `tokens` array is empty. If the `tokens` array is null, this replacement would throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!tokens.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is null, while this replacement checks if the `tokens` array is empty or null. If the `tokens` array is null, this replacement would return false, while the original
