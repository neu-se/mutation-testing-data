  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the sine of the sum of the imaginary part and 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calculates the sine of the imaginary part of the complex number, while the new code fragment calculates the sine of twice the imaginary part.

DONE.
