  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b > x || x > b
```
This is the original code fragment, which is correct.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b > x && x > b
```
This is a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment. It will always evaluate to `false`, even if `x` is between `-b` and `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b > x || x < b
```
This is a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment. It will always evaluate to `true`, even if `x` is not between `-b` and `b`.

DONE.
