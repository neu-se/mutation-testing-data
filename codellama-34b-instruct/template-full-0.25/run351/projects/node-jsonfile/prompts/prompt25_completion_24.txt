  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `content` variable, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the `content` variable to lowercase, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
content.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `content` variable into an array of individual characters, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
