  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "call" is a different method than "apply" and would not pass the same arguments to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"bind"
```
This would result in different behavior because "bind" is a different method than "apply" and would not pass the same arguments to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"apply" + "call"
```
This would result in different behavior because "apply" and "call" are different methods and would not pass the same arguments to the function.

DONE.
