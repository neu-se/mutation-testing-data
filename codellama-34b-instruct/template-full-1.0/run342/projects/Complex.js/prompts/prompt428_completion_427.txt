  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `&&` has higher precedence than `||` and will return `0` even if `places` is `null` or `undefined`, while `||` would return the right-hand side operand, which is `0` in this case.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places & 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `&` is the bitwise AND operator and will always return `0` regardless of the value of `places`, while `||` would return the right-hand side operand if `places` is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places++
```
This would result in different behavior because `++` is the increment operator and will increase the value of `places` by 1, while `||` would return the right-hand side operand if `places` is falsy.
