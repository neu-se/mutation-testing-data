  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sinh` function is different from `cosh` and would produce a different result for the computation of `d`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a different function than `cosh` and would produce a different result for the computation of `d`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var d = Math.cos(a) + Math.sin(b);
```
This would result in different behavior because `d` is being computed with the sum of `Math.cos(a)` and `Math.sin(b)` instead of `cosh(b)` which is a different operation.

DONE
