  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys in the object, while `Object.values` returns an array of values in the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries.map(([k, v]) => v)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs in the object, and then `map` is used to extract the values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys.reduce((memo, k) => memo[k] = b[k], {})
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` is used to extract the keys from the object, and then `reduce` is used to create a new object with the same keys and the values from the `b` object.

DONE.
