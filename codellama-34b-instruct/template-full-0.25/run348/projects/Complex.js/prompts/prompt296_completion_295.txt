  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and `a + 1` would add 1 to the value of `a`, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and `b` is a different variable, which could change the result of the calculation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a variable, and `a * b` would multiply the value of `a` by the value of `b`, which could change the result of the calculation.

DONE.
