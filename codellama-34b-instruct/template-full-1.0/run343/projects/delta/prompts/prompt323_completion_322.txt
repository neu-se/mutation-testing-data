  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset calculation for the slice would be incorrect, leading to a different resulting slice.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset calculation for the slice would be incorrect, leading to a different resulting slice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the offset calculation for the slice would be incorrect, leading to a different resulting slice.

DONE.
