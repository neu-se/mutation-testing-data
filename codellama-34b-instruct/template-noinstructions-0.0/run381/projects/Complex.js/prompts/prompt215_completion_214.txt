  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.hypot()` function, which calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides. In contrast, `a + b` simply adds the two values together.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.hypot()` function, which calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides. In contrast, `a - b` simply subtracts the two values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.hypot()` function, which calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides. In contrast, `a * b`
