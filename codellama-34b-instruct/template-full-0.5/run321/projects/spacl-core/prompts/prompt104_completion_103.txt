  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which was `this.get(name)`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which was `this.get(name)`. The `true` argument would cause the `get` method to return a different value if the key is not found.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.get(name, function(key, value) { return value; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code, which was `this.get(name)`. The function argument would cause the `get` method to return a different value based on the key and value.

DONE.
