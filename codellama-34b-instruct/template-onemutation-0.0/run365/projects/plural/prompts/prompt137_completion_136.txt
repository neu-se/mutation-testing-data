  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rule[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `rule[0]` is a regular expression, and `rule[1]` is a string. In the original code, `rule[0]` is used to test the word against the regular expression, and `rule[1]` is used as the replacement string. By using `rule[0]` as the replacement string, the code would be using the regular expression as the replacement string, which would likely result in unexpected behavior.

DONE.
