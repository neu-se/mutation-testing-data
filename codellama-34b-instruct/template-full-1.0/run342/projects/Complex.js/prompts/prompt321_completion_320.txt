  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the sin function has a different output than the cos function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because the acos function has a different output than the cos function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the cos function multiplied by 2 would have a different output than the cos function.

DONE.
