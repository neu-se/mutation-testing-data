  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `a` to be `null` or `undefined`, while this code only checks for `a` to be not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `a` to be not an object, while this code checks for `a` to be an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for `a` to be not an object or `null`, while this code only checks for `a` to be `null`.

DONE.
