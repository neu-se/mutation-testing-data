  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with a value of `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(false)` would call the callback function with a value of `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with a value of `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would call the callback function with a value of `null` and a value of `array[i++]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `cb` would call the callback function with a value of `true`, while the new code fragment `cb(null, array[i++])` would call the callback function with
