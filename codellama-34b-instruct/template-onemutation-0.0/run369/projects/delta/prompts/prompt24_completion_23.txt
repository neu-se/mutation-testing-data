  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diff` function to always return `undefined`, regardless of the input. The original code fragment `b[key]` correctly references the value of the `key` property in the `b` object, while `a[key]` would reference the value of the `key` property in the `a` object, which may not exist or have a different value.

DONE.
