 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise might be resolved with a null value, whereas the original code resolves with the result value from the fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(true);
```
This would result in different behavior because the returned promise might be resolved with a boolean value, whereas the original code resolves with the result value from the fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve(function() {});
