  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb in verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be iterating over the enumerable properties of the `verbs` object, rather than the contents of the `verbs` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs))
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be iterating over the values of the `verbs` object, rather than the contents of the `verbs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let i = 0; i < verbs.length; i++)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be iterating over the elements of the `verbs` array using a traditional `for` loop, rather than using the `for...of` loop with iterable objects.

DONE.
