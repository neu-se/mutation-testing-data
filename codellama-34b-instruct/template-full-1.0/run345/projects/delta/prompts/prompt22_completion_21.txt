  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isEqual(a[key], b[key])
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!isEqual` operator to check for inequality, while this code fragment uses the `!=` operator to check for inequality. This could cause bugs in code that relies on the `!isEqual` operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!isEqual` operator to check for inequality, while this code fragment uses the `!=` operator to check for inequality. This could cause bugs in code that relies on the `!isEqual` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == b[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `!isEqual` operator to check for inequality, while this code fragment uses the `==` operator to check for equality. This could
