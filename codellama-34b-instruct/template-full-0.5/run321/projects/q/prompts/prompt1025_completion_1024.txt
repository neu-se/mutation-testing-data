  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `Q`, and therefore does not have the same methods and properties as `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value that is not an instance of `Q`, and therefore does not have the same methods and properties as `Q`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an empty object that does not have the same methods and properties as `Q`.

DONE.
