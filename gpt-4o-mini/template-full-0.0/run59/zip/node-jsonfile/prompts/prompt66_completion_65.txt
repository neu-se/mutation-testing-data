Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFEFF\s*/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would also remove any whitespace characters following the BOM, which is not the intended behavior of the original code that only targets the BOM itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\uFFFE/
```
This would result in different behavior because it targets a different Unicode character (the BOM for UTF-16), which would not be present in typical UTF-8 encoded content, thus failing to remove the actual BOM for UTF-8.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\ufeff/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match the BOM character anywhere in the string, not just at the beginning, potentially removing it from unintended locations in the content.

DONE.
