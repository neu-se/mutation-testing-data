  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Q` promise is resolved with the value of `result.value`, whereas in this option, the promise is rejected with the same value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value);
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Q` promise is resolved with the value of `result.value`, whereas in this option, the promise is resolved with the value of `result.value` wrapped in a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(result.value).then(function () {
    throw new Error("Test error");
});
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `Q` promise is resolved with the value of `result.value`, whereas in this option, the promise is resolved with the value of `result.value` and
