  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an 'es' to the end of words that end in 'x', 'ch', or 's', while this new code fragment would add an 's' to the end of words that end in 'x', 'ch', or 's'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$/i, function(w) { return w + 'es' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would add an 'es' to the end of words that end in 'x', 'ch', or 's', while this new code fragment would add an 'es' to the end of words that end in 'x', 'ch', or 's'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/x$|ch$|s$
