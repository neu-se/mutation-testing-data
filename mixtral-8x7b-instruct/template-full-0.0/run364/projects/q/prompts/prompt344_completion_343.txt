 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `_fulfilled` function would return `null` instead of the original promise's resolved value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Promise(function () {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new, unresolved promise instead of passing through the original promise's resolved value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new, resolved promise with a value of `undefined` instead of passing through the original promise's resolved value.

DONE.
