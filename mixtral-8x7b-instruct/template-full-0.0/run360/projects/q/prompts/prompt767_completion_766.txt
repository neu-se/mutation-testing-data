 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { throw new Error('Buggy replacement'); }
```
This would result in different behavior because a thrown error would prevent the promise from being resolved or rejected properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to treat the second argument as an onFulfilled handler instead of an options object, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () { return undefined; }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `when` function to treat the returned promise as resolved with a value of `undefined`, which might not be the expected behavior in the context of the surrounding code.

DONE.
