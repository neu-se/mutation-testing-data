Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
filename + '.tmp'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `openSync` method would attempt to open a file with a different name, potentially leading to a file not found error or unexpected behavior if the file exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + filename
```
This would result in different behavior because the `openSync` method would attempt to open a file in the current working directory, potentially leading to a file not found error or unexpected behavior if the file does not exist in the current directory.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.getResolvedLink(filename).getNode().getPath()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `openSync` method would attempt to open a file using the resolved path of the link, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the link is a symbolic link or if the file does not exist at the resolved path.

DONE.
