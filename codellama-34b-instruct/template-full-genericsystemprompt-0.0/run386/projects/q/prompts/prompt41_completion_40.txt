  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush()` is a function that is already defined in the code, and calling it again would cause an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(1)` is a function call with a different argument than the original `flush()`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush(undefined)` is a function call with a different argument than the original `flush()`, which could cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
