  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the logarithm to be taken of a different number, which would change the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the logarithm to be taken of a different number, which would change the result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the logarithm to be taken of a different number, which would change the result.

DONE.
