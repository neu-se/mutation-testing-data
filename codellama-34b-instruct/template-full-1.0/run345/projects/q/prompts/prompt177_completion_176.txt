  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
*stackLine.indexOf("/module.js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value in the string. In this case, if the code fragment is changed to `stackLine.indexOf("/module.js:") !== -1`, the function will no longer check if the string contains the substring "/module.js:".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.includes(".js:") !== -1 ||
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes` checks if the string contains a specific substring, whereas `indexOf` checks if the string contains a specific character. In this case, if the code fragment is changed to `stackLine.includes(".js:") !== -1`, the function will no longer check if the string contains the substring ".js:".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.startsWith("module.js:") ||
```
This would
