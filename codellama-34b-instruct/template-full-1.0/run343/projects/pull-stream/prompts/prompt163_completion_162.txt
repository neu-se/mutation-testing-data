  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 array && !array.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the array is falsy, while this code checks if the array is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 array.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the array is falsy, while this code checks if the array has a length of 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 !Array.isArray(array)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the array is a falsy value, while this code checks if the array is not an array.

DONE.
