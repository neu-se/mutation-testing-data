  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["fin"]
```
This would result in different behavior because `fin` is not a valid method of the `Q` object, and would cause an error to be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"].bind(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` would return a new function that is bound to the `null` context, which would cause the `finally` method to be called on a different object than the one intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object)["finally"].call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` would call the `finally` method on the `null` context, which would cause the method to be called on a different object than the one intended.

DONE.
