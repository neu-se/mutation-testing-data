  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is defined in the scope of the function, while `null` is a constant value that is not defined in the scope of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is defined in the scope of the function, while `undefined` is a constant value that is not defined in the scope of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is defined in the scope of the function, while `false` is a constant value that is not defined in the scope of the function.

DONE.
