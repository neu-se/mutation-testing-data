  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flush()
```
This would result in different behavior because `flush` is a function that is not defined in the provided code snippet, so it would cause a `ReferenceError`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(flush, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that schedules a function to be executed after a certain amount of time, so it would cause the `flush` function to be executed after a delay of 0 milliseconds, which is different from the original behavior of executing the `flush` function immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout(function() { flush(); }, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flush` function to be executed in a separate event loop, which is different from the original behavior of executing the `flush` function immediately.

DONE.
