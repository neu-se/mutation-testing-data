  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] * places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is being used instead of the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the division operator is used instead of multiplication.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] / places
```
This would result in different behavior because the imaginary part of the complex number is being used instead of the real part, and the division operator is used instead of multiplication.

DONE.
