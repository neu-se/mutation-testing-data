  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called with a string argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the test to fail if the `coordinates` property is not defined on the `point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called with a string argument, which is not the same as the original code fragment. This could cause the test to fail if the `type` property is not defined on the `point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point.hasOwnProperty('coordinates') && point.hasOwnProperty('type')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method is called with a string argument, which is not the same as the original
