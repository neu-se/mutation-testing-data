  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.push(baseOp);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the baseOp to the inverted delta, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.retain(baseOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the length of the baseOp, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inverted.delete(baseOp.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the length of the baseOp, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
