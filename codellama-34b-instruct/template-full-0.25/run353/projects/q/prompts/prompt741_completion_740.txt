  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(rejection);
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, and the `any` function would not be able to handle it correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, and the `any` function would not be able to handle it correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(new Error("Q can't get fulfillment value from any promise, all promises were rejected. Last error message: " + rejection.message));
```
This would result in different behavior because the rejection reason would be different, and the `any` function would not be able to handle it correctly.

DONE.
