  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the length property of the `args` array, while this replacement code fragment is accessing the length property of the `name` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the `name` property of the `this` object, while this replacement code fragment is accessing the `name` property of the `object` parameter.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is accessing the length property of the `args` array, while this replacement code fragment is accessing the length property of the `args` array plus one.

DONE.
