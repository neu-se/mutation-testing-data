  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, while `none` is not a valid method and would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, while `some` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in an array have resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `all` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array have resolved, while `any` is a method that returns a promise that resolves when any of the promises in an array have resolved.

DONE.
