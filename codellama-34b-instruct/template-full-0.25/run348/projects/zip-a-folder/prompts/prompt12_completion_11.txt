  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read and write permissions, while this new code fragment only checks for write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.X_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read and write permissions, while this new code fragment only checks for execute permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.F_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks for read and write permissions, while this new code fragment only checks for file existence.

DONE.
