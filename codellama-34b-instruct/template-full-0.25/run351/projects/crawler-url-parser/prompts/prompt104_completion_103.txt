  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.indexOf(text) > -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value, whereas `includes` returns a boolean indicating whether the value is present in the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.split(text).length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `split` returns an array of substrings, and the length of the array is greater than 1 if the specified value is present in the string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tmpUrl.text.match(text) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array of matches, and the array is not null if the specified value is present in the string.

DONE.
