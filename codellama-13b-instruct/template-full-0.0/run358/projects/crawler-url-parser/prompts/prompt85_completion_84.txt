  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href = href.replace(/;.*$/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove any semicolons and everything after them from the `href` string. This could potentially cause the `href` string to be modified in unexpected ways, leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href = href.replace(/;/g,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove any semicolons from the `href` string. This could potentially cause the `href` string to be modified in unexpected ways, leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href = href.replace(/;/,"");
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method is used to remove any semicolons from the `href` string. This could potentially cause the `href` string to be modified in unexpected ways, leading to different behavior.
