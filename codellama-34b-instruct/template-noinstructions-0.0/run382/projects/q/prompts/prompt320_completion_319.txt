  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op](promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function directly instead of using the `apply` method, which could cause the function to be called with the wrong `this` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].call(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with the correct `this` value, but it would not pass the `args` array as an argument to the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
descriptor[op].apply(promise, args)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the function with the correct `this` value and pass the `args` array as an argument to the function.

DONE.
