  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
attributes[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the attribute with the given key, rather than the attribute object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(attributes)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the attribute with the given key, rather than the attribute object itself, but it would do so by iterating over the values of the attributes object rather than the keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(attributes)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the key of the attribute with the given key, rather than the attribute object itself.

DONE.
