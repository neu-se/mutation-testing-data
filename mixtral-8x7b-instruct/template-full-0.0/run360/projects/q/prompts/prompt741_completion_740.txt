 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred promise would be resolved immediately, instead of waiting for all other promises to settle.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.reject(new Error("Forced rejection"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred promise would be rejected immediately, regardless of the other promises' states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.reject(promises[0])
```
This would result in different behavior because the deferred promise would be rejected with the first promise from the input array, instead of waiting for all promises to settle.

DONE.
