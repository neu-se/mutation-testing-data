  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would be called on the integer `0`, rather than the `Delta` object, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would be called on the `null` object, rather than the `Delta` object, which would likely throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter` method would be called on an empty object, rather than the `Delta` object, which would likely not produce any meaningful output.

DONE.
