Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(θ)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from using the sine of the bearing angle to using the cosine, which would lead to incorrect results in the destination point calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ + 90)
```
This would result in different behavior because it effectively shifts the angle by 90 degrees, which would alter the direction of the calculated destination point, leading to an incorrect location.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin(θ) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it scales the sine value by a factor of 2, which would incorrectly amplify the effect of the bearing on the destination point, resulting in an inaccurate calculation of the new coordinates.

DONE.
