 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Function("deferred", "return deferred")()
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new object instead of using the `defer` function, which may not have the same methods or properties as the original `defer` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an empty object instead of a `defer` object, which may not have the same methods or properties as the original `defer` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function () {
  return {
    promise: undefined,
    resolve: function () {},
    fulfill: function () {},
    reject: function () {},
    notify: function () {}
  };
}
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates an object with the same method names as the `defer` object, but the methods do not have the same behavior as the original `defer` function.
