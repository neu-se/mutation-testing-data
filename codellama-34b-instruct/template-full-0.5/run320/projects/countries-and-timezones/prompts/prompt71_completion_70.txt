  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the function to return a different result, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the function to return a different result, potentially causing the tests to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name) - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the function to return a different result, potentially causing the tests to fail.

DONE.
