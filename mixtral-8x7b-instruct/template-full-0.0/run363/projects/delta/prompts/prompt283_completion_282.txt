 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
''.indexOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return -1, as it's trying to find the index of an empty string in the `thisOp.insert` string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
123.indexOf
