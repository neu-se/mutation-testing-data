 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would behave differently when called with `null` thisp.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
5
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would attempt to call the `value` as a function with the provided arguments, which would result in a TypeError if `value` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method of the returned promise would attempt to call the `value` as a function with the provided arguments, which would result in a TypeError if `value` is not a function.

DONE.
