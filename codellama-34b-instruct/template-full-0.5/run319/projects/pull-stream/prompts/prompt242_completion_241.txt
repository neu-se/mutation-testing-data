  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment where `data` is passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment where `data` is passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end, "foo"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string `"foo"` would be passed as the second argument to the `cb` function, which is not the same as the original code fragment where `data` is passed.

DONE.
