  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with the wrong argument, leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with a different argument, leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be called with a different argument, leading to incorrect results.

DONE.
