  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the value `0` when the dirty connection is instantiated, indicating that there are no keys in the database. Replacing it with `1` would cause the event to be emitted with the value `1`, which would indicate that there is one key in the database, even if there are no keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'load'` event with the value `0` when the dirty connection is instantiated, indicating that there are no keys in the database. Replacing it with `-1` would cause the event to be emitted with the value `-1`, which would indicate that there is one key in the database that is not present in the database, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', Math.
