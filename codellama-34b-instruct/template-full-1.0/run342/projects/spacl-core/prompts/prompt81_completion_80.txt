  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.split('.')[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.split('.')` would return an array of strings, but `path` is a string, so `path.split('.')[0]` would return a single string. This would cause the `matches` method to fail if the path contains a dot, as it would not match the expected format.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a string, so the `matches` method would throw an error when trying to access the `split` method of `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a string, so the `matches` method would throw an error when trying to access the `split` method of `undefined`.

DONE.
