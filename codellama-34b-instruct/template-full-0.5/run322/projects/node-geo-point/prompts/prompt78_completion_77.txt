  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rad2deg
```
This would result in different behavior because `rad2deg` is the inverse of `deg2rad` and would convert radians to degrees, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.PI` is a constant representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, whereas `deg2rad` is a function that converts degrees to radians.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` is a function that calculates the sine of a value, whereas `deg2rad` converts degrees to radians.

DONE.
