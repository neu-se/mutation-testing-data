Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[m]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the lower bound of the `quantileSelect` function from the current left index `l` to the middle index `m`, potentially altering the sorting order of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
indices[r]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the lower bound of the `quantileSelect` function from the current left index `l` to the right index `r`, which could lead to incorrect partial sorting of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it fixes the lower bound of the `quantileSelect` function to always start from the beginning of the array, ignoring the current left index `l` and potentially changing the overall sorting process.

DONE.
