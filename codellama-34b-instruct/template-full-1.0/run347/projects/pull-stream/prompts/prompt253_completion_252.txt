  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nextStream()
```
This would result in different behavior because `nextStream()` is not the same as `nextChunk()`, and it would cause the code to enter the `nextStream()` function without actually streaming the data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read(null, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `_read(null, cb)` is not the same as `_read(null, function(err, data) { ... })`, and it would cause the code to make a synchronous read instead of an asynchronous one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because `read(true, cb)` is not the same as `read(null, cb)`, and it would cause the code to read the data in a different way, potentially causing errors or bugs.
