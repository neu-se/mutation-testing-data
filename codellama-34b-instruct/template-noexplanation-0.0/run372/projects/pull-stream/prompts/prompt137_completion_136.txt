  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle this change.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This change will also cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle this change.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end * 2
```
This change will cause the function to return a different value than the original code, which may cause the tests to fail if they are not robust enough to handle this change.

DONE.
