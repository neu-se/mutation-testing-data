  The PLACEHOLDER in the code is used to invoke a function that is passed as an argument to the `flatten` function. The current code fragment is:
```
<PLACEHOLDER>()
```
Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1+1()
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `1+1` evaluates to `2`, which is not a function and cannot be invoked.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''()
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty string is not a function and cannot be invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null()
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and cannot be invoked.

DONE.
