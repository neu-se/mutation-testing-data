 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
`./${globPart}`
```
This would result in different behavior because it would prepend `./` to the `globPart`, which might not be desired and could lead to unexpected results when using globs.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'./' + globPart
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate `./` and `globPart` with a string concatenation operation, which might not be desired and could lead to unexpected results when using globs.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
path.join('.', globPart)
