  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp, value, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the wrong `this` value, leading to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, value, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the wrong `this` value, leading to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
self, value, index, self
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with the wrong `this` value, leading to unexpected results.

DONE.
