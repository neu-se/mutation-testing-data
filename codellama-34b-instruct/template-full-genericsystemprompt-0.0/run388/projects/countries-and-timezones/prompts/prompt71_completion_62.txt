  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name + "foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `name` parameter is modified, which would cause the `buildTimezone` function to return a different timezone object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, true)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an additional `true` argument, which would cause it to return a different timezone object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildTimezone(data, name, false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function would be called with an additional `false` argument, which would cause it to return a different timezone object.

DONE.
