  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and the `nfapply` method would not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and the `nfapply` method would not be called with the correct arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because an empty array is not a valid argument for the `nfapply` method, and it would throw an error.

DONE.
