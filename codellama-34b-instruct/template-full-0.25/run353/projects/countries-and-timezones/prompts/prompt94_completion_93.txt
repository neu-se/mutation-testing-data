  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId + 1, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, options + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different set of timezones than the ones intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
countryId, { deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deprecated` property of the `options` parameter would be set to `true`, which could cause the function to return a different set of timezones than the ones intended.

DONE.
