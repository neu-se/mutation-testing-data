  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.split('/').slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment splits the `spec` string on `/` and returns all elements after the first one, while the new code fragment splits the `spec` string on `/` and returns all elements except the first one.

DONE.
