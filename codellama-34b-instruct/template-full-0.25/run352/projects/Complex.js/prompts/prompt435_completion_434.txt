  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by zero, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-10
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by a negative number, which would result in a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would divide by a non-integer number, which would result in a different outcome.

DONE.
