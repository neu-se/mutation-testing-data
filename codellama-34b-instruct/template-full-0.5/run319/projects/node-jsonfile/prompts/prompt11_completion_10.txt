  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `data` variable is a string, and adding 1 to it would result in a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `data` string to uppercase, which could change the meaning of the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.split('').reverse().join('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split()`, `reverse()`, and `join()` methods would reverse the order of the characters in the `data` string, which could change the meaning of the JSON data.

DONE.
