  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'y' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last character of the word and adds 'y' to the end, but this code fragment would simply add 'y' to the end without removing any characters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() + 'IES' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last character of the word and adds 'ies' to the end, but this code fragment would uppercase the entire word and add 'IES' to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.slice(0, -2) + 'ies' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment removes the last character of the word and adds 'ies' to the end, but this code fragment would remove the last two characters of the word and add
