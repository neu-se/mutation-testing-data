  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.lastIndexOf("\n") + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start searching for the last occurrence of the newline character in the stack trace, instead of the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.split("\n").length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would count the number of lines in the stack trace, instead of finding the index of the first newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
e.stack.indexOf("\n", e.stack.indexOf("\n") + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the index of the second newline character in the stack trace, instead of the first one.

DONE.
