  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key] = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the object, potentially causing the `hasOwnProperty` check to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key] = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the object, potentially causing the `hasOwnProperty` check to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[key] = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would modify the object, potentially causing the `hasOwnProperty` check to fail.

DONE.
