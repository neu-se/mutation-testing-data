  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i--)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` by 1, while this new code fragment decrements `i` by 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, max)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` by 1, while this new code fragment always returns the value of `max`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, i + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment increments `i` by 1, while this new code fragment increments `i` by 2.

DONE.
