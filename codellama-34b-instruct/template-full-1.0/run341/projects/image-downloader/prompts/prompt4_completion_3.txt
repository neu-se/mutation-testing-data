  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options
```
This would result in different behavior because `options` is an object and negating it will always return `false`, whereas `!options.dest` checks whether the `dest` property of the `options` object is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!!options.dest
```
This would result in different behavior because `!!` is the not-not operator, which is used to convert a value to its boolean equivalent. In this case, it would invert the value of `options.dest` twice, which could change the behavior of the code if `options.dest` was originally falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Boolean(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Boolean()` is a function that takes a value and returns its boolean equivalent. In this case, it would convert `options.dest` to a boolean, which could change the behavior of the code if `options.dest` was originally a
