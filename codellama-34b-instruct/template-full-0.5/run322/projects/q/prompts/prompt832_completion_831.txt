  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called, and the promise would be resolved instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would result in different behavior because an error would be thrown, and the promise would be rejected instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
void 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `rejected` callback would not be called, and the promise would be resolved with an undefined value instead.

DONE.
