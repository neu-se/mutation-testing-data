  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with only one argument, instead of two.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with three arguments, instead of two.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the function would be called with no arguments, instead of two.

DONE.
