  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of the values of the object's own enumerable string-keyed properties, while `Object.assign` returns a new object with the specified source object's own enumerable string-keyed properties copied to it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of [key, value] pairs for each enumerable own property in the source object, while `Object.assign` returns a new object with the specified source object's own enumerable string-keyed properties copied to it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(timezones).reduce((prev, curr) => { prev[curr] = 1; return prev }, {})
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new object with the same keys as the `timezones`
