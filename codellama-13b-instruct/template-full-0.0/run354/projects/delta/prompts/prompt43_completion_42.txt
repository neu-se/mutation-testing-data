  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant is now set to the number 1, which is not a valid character code. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `embedType` property of the `a` and `b` objects, since they are now numbers instead of objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER` constant is now set to `undefined`, which is not a valid character code. This would cause the `getEmbedTypeAndData` function to throw an error when it tries to access the `embedType` property of the `a` and `b` objects, since they are now `undefined` instead of objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `NULL_CHARACTER`
