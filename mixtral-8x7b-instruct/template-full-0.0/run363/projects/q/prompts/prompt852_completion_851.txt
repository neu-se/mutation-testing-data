 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error("Timed out after " + (ms - 10) + " ms")
```
This would result in different behavior because the timeout error message would have an incorrect timeout duration.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the error object would be replaced with an empty object, which would not contain the correct error information.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() { throw error }
```
This would result in different behavior because the error would be thrown immediately instead of being returned as a rejected promise.

DONE.
