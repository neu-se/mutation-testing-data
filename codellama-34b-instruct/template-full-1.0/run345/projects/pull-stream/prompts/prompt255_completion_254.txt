  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `_read` to `null`, even if the current stream has not been exhausted.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_read = stream
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always set `_read` to `stream`, even if the current stream has been exhausted.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always call the callback function, even if the current stream has been exhausted.

DONE.
