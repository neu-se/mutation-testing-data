  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the string would always be 0, causing the loop to never execute.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time than it should, potentially causing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time than it should, potentially causing the code to miss some important logic.

DONE.
