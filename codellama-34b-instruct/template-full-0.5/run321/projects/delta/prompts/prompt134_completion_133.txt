  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { insert: lastOp.insert + newOp.insert };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the `newOp.insert` value into the `lastOp.insert` value, rather than the `newOp.retain` value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { retain: lastOp.retain + newOp.retain };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the `newOp.retain` value, rather than the `newOp.insert` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[index - 1] = { delete: lastOp.delete + newOp.delete };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the `newOp.delete` value, rather than the `newOp.insert` value.

DONE.
