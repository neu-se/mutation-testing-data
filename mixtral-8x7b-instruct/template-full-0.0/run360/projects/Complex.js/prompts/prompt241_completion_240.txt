 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.pow(Math.E, a)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.pow(Math.E, a)` calculates the power of e raised to the power of a, while the original `Math.exp(a)` calculates the exponential function of a.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * 2.71828
