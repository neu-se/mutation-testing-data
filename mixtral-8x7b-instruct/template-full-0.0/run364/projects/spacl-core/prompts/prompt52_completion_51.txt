 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.push('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an empty string to the `parts` array, which is not the same as pushing the `part` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
parts.unshift(part)
```
This would result in different behavior because it inserts the `part` variable at the beginning of the `parts` array instead of pushing it to the end.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
props.push(part.slice(1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it pushes the `part` variable to the `props` array instead of the `parts` array.

DONE.
