  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any
```
This would result in different behavior because `any` is a method that returns `true` if any element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `all` is a method that returns `true` if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
some
```
This would result in different behavior because `some` is a method that returns `true` if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `all` is a method that returns `true` if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
none
```
This would result in different behavior because `none` is a method that returns `true` if none of the elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function, whereas `all` is a method that returns `true` if all elements in the array pass the test implemented
