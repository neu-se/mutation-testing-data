  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the variable `verb` is a string, while `i` is a number. This would cause the loop to iterate over the indices of the `verbs` array instead of the verbs themselves.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb in verbs;
```
This would result in different behavior because `in` is a keyword that checks if a property exists in an object. Using it in this context would cause the loop to iterate over the properties of the `verbs` object, which is a different behavior than what was intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const verb !== 'undefined';
```
This would result in different behavior because `!==` is a comparison operator that checks if the values of two operands are different. Using it in this context would cause the loop to iterate over the verbs that are defined, rather than all the verbs.

DONE.
