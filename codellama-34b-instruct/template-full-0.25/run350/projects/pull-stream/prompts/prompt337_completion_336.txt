  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.foo
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop.foo` is a different property than `prop`, and may not be a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` is a different value than `prop`, and may not be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return prop }
```
This would result in different behavior because the new function returns a different value than the original `prop` function.

DONE.
