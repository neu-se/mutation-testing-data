  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c > '-'
```
This would result in different behavior because c > '-' will always be false since c is a single character and cannot be greater than a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c === '+'
```
This would result in different behavior because c === '+' would only be true if c is a single character and equal to '+', which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c !== 'I'
```
This would result in different behavior because c !== 'I' would be true if c is not 'I', which means it would allow for incorrect calculations when the c is actually 'I', which is used to represent an imaginary number in the original code.

DONE.
