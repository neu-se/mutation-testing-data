 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the number of operations in the Delta object, instead of slicing the other Delta object based on the current index and length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the first operation in the Delta object, instead of slicing the other Delta object based on the current index and length.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a random number instead of slicing the other Delta object based on the current index and length.

DONE.
