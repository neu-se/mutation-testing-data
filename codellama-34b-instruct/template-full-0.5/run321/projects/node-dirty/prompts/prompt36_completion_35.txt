  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [val, key];
```
This would result in different behavior because it swaps the key and value in the `Map` object, which could cause the `set` method to overwrite the wrong key-value pair.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, val + 1];
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the value by 1, which could cause the `set` method to store the wrong value in the `Map` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const [key, val] = [key, undefined];
```
This would result in different behavior because it sets the value to `undefined`, which could cause the `set` method to delete the wrong key-value pair from the `Map` object.

DONE.
