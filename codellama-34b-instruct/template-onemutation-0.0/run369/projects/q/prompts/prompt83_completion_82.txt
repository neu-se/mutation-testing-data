  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flushing
```
This would result in different behavior because `flushing` is always truthy, so the `if` statement would always be executed, even if `flushing` is not actually true. This would cause the `nextTick` function to be called repeatedly, leading to an infinite loop.
