  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false`, even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has higher precedence than the `if` statement, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `false` if `abort` is `true`, even if the `cb` function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has higher precedence than the `if` statement, so the `if` statement would evaluate to `true` if `abort` is `false`, even if the `cb` function is not called.

DONE.
