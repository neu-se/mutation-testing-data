Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'object' && a !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the function to proceed with a non-object or null value for `a`, potentially leading to unexpected errors later in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof a === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error when `a` is undefined, which is a different condition than checking for non-object types, thus potentially allowing other non-object values to pass through without error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only throw an error if `a` is an array, allowing other non-object types (like strings or numbers) to be accepted, which could lead to incorrect handling of the input.

DONE.
