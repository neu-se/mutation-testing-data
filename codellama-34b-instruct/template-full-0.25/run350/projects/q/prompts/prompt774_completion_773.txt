  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.slice(1)` would return a new array containing all elements of `promises` except the first one, whereas `promises` would return the original array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.concat(["new promise"])
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.concat(["new promise"])` would return a new array containing all elements of `promises` followed by the string "new promise", whereas `promises` would return the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.filter(function(promise) { return promise.isFulfilled(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because `promises.filter(function(promise) { return promise.isFulfilled(); })` would return a new array containing only the fulfilled promises in `promises`, whereas `promises` would return
