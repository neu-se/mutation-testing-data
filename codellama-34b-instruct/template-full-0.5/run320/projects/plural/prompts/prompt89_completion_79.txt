  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'peoples'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "people" is now misspelled as "peoples," which would cause the pluralization function to return an incorrect value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'humans'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "person" is now replaced with "human," which would cause the pluralization function to return an incorrect value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'person', 'individuals'
```
This would result in different behavior because the word "person" is now replaced with "individual," which would cause the pluralization function to return an incorrect value.

DONE.
