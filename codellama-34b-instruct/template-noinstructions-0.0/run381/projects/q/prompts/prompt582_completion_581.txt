  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function, which is not a valid method for a function. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", "error")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function with an additional argument, which is not a valid argument for the `bind` method. This would cause an error to be thrown, which would result in the promise being rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", "error", "message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `bind` method is being called on the `continuer` function
