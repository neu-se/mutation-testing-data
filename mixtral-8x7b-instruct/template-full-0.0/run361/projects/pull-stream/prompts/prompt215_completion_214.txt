 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(err, cb)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly calls the callback `cb` with the error, instead of propagating the error through the `next` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because it immediately calls the callback `cb` with the next data, without waiting for the mapper function to process it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
next(err)
```
This would result in different behavior because it calls the callback `cb` with only one argument, the error, while the original code fragment passes two arguments, the error and the data.

DONE.
