  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be incremented by 1, which would change the resulting GeoPoint object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the longitude value would be decremented by 1, which would change the resulting GeoPoint object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the latitude value would be multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting GeoPoint object.

DONE.
