  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy
```
This would result in different behavior because `busy` will always evaluate to `true` when `busy` is truthy, whereas the original code only continues when `!busy` (i.e., `busy` is falsy).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!aborted
```
This would result in different behavior because `!aborted` will always evaluate to `true` when `aborted` is falsy, whereas the original code only continues when `!aborted` (i.e., `aborted` is truthy).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort
```
This would result in different behavior because `abort` will always evaluate to `true` when `abort` is truthy, whereas the original code only continues when `!abort` (i.e., `abort` is falsy).

DONE.
