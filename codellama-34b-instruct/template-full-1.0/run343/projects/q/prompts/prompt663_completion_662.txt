  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"patch" [name, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the method being dispatched would be "patch" rather than "post".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 2)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument list would be offset by one, potentially accessing the wrong variables or causing a type error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, array_slice(arguments, 0, arguments.length - 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the argument list would be truncated by one element, potentially omitting a required argument.

DONE.
