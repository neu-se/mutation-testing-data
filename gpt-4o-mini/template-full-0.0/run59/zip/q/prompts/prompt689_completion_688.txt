Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"call"
```
This would result in different behavior because the method name "call" suggests invoking a function directly rather than applying arguments to it, which could lead to incorrect handling of the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"execute"
```
This would result in different behavior because "execute" is not a standard method name in this context, which could cause the function to fail or behave unexpectedly since it does not match the expected "apply" method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"invoke"
```
This would result in different behavior because "invoke" implies a different method of calling the function, potentially leading to a mismatch in how arguments are handled compared to the original "apply" method.

DONE.
