  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the decrement operator `--` would cause the counter to count down instead of up.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i *= 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication operator `*` would cause the counter to count by 2s instead of 1s.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the assignment operator `=` would cause the counter to always start at 0 instead of starting at the value of `i`.

DONE.
