  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Something went wrong'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a specific message, while the new code emits a generic error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(buffer));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error with a specific message, while the new code emits an error with the contents of the buffer, which could be anything.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('drain');
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an error, while the new code emits a 'drain' event, which could cause the program to continue running even if there is an error.

DONE.
