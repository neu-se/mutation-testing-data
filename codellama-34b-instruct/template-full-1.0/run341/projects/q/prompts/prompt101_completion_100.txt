  Sure, here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER in the provided code with a buggy code fragment that would produce different behavior:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with `this` set to the global object (in non-strict mode), and then try to access the first element of the return value, which would likely throw an error if the return value is not an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind(null)()[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback` function with `this` set to `null`, and then try to access the first element of the return value, which would likely throw an error if the return value is not an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null, [][0])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `callback
