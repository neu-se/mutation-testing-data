  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\r\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would have a different representation of a line break.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would have a different representation of a tab character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the string would be empty.

DONE.
