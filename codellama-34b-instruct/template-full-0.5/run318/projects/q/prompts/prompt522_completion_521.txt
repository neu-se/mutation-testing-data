  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because null is a falsy value, and it would not trigger the rejection case in the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because undefined is a falsy value, and it would not trigger the rejection case in the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("rejection")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new Error object, which would trigger the rejection case in the code.

DONE.
