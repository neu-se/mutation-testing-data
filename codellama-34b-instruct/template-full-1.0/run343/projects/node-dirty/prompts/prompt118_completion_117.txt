  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'read_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_load` method to emit the event `'read_close'` instead of `'close'`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_load` method to emit no event instead of `'close'`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_load` method to emit the event `'error'` instead of `'close'`, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application.

DONE.
