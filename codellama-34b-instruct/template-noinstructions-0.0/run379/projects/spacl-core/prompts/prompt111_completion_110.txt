  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.keys()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
verbs.values()
```
This would result in different behavior because `verbs.values()` returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(verbs)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(verbs)` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, whereas `verbs` returns the object itself.

DONE.
