  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire `ops` array, rather than just the lines that contain the newline character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire `ops` array, minus the last element, rather than just the lines that contain the newline character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `eachLine` method to iterate over the entire `ops` array, plus the last element, rather than just the lines that contain the newline character.

DONE.
