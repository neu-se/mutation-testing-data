  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a single `insert` operation, rather than a `Delta` object with a single `insert` operation followed by a `retain` operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a single `insert` operation followed by a `retain` operation, but the `retain` operation would have a length of 1, rather than the length of the `insert` operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `transform` method to return a `Delta` object with a single `insert` operation followed by a `retain` operation, but the `retain` operation would
