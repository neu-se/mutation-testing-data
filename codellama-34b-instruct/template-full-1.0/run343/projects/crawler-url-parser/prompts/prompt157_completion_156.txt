  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/).length">"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the matched group with its length instead of its contents, which would cause the function to return a different value for the link type.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>(/((\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$)).length"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern than the original code, which would lead to different behavior when evaluating the link type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"<PLACEHOLDER>(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/).length">)"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a different pattern than the original code and also has missing or extra parentheses, which would cause a syntax error.

DONE.
