  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.regex.test(path)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test()` method of the `Matcher` class returns a boolean indicating whether the matcher matches the given string, whereas the `match()` method returns an array of matches.

DONE.
