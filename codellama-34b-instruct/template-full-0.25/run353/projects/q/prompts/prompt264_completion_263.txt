  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolve` is a function that returns a resolved promise, whereas `fulfill` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
notify
```
This would result in different behavior because `notify` is a function that sends a notification to the promise's progress listeners, whereas `fulfill` is a function that fulfills the promise.

DONE.
