 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly uses the `fs` module's `writeFile` method instead of using the `universalify` function to make it work in both Node.js and browser environments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => fs.writeFile
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an arrow function to return the `fs.writeFile` method, which would not have the same behavior as the original `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses `bind` to create a new function with a specific `this` value, which might not behave the same as the original `universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile)`.

DONE.
