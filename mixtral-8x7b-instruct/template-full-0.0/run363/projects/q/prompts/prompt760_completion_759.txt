 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[].map.bind(promises)
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the native `Array.prototype.map` instead of the `Q.array_map` function, which may not handle promises correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.all(promises.map(p => Q(p)))
```
This would result in different behavior because it wraps every promise in a new promise using `Q`, which may cause issues with promise chaining or error handling.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
promises.slice(0).map(p => Q(p))
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a shallow copy of the `promises` array and then maps over it, which may cause issues with mutation or index-based operations in the original code.

DONE.
