  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PLACEHOLDER = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reverse()` method on an array, which reverses the order of the elements in the array. The new code does not modify the array at all, so the behavior of the program would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PLACEHOLDER = 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reverse()` method on an array, which reverses the order of the elements in the array. The new code would not reverse the order of the elements in the array, so the behavior of the program would be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const PLACEHOLDER = 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `reverse()` method on an array, which reverses the order of the elements in the array. The new code would reverse the order of the elements
