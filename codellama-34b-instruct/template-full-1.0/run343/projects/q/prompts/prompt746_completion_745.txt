  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onRejected
```
This would result in different behavior because when a promise is rejected, the `onRejected` function would be called instead of `onProgress`, and the resulting promise would be rejected instead of pending.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onFulfilled
```
This would result in different behavior because when a promise is fulfilled, the `onFulfilled` function would be called instead of `onProgress`, and the resulting promise would be fulfilled with the returned value instead of pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so the promise would be left pending and the `onProgress` function would not be called.

DONE.
