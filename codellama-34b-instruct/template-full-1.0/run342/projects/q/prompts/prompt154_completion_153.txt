  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "<!-- Our friends at Hackbass #Testing Generator Consortium recommend avoiding whitespace in error messages. -->\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment includes an HTML comment that would not be present in the original code, which could cause the error message to be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR.toUpperCase() + "\n"
```
This would result in different behavior because the new code fragment uses the uppercase version of the `STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR` constant, which could cause the error message to be different.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR.substring(0, STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR.length - 1) +
