  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key-value pair from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets the value for a key in the map. If `delete` is used instead of `set`, the key-value pair would be removed from the map, which could cause the `get` method to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all key-value pairs from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets the value for a key in the map. If `clear` is used instead of `set`, the map would be emptied, which could cause the `get` method to return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, undefined)
