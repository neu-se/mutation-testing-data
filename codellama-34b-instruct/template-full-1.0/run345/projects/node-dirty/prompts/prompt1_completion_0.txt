  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would override the `_load` method with an empty function, causing the code to skip the loading of the dirty database file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this.destroy(); };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the Dirty instance to be destroyed immediately after it is created, effectively cancelling any further operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._load = () => { this._writeStream = null; };
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `_writeStream` property to be set to `null`, which would prevent any writes from being persisted to the dirty database file.

DONE.
