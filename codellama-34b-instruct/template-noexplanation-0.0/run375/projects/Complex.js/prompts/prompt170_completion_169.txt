  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `z` variable instead of `this`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a['isZero']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `a` variable instead of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b['isZero']
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it uses the `b` variable instead of `this`.

DONE.
