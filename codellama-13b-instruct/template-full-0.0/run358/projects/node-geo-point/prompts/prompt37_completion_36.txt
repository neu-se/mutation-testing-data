  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point1Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point1Rad` variable is not defined in the code, and therefore the `cos` function would throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point2Rad
```
This would result in different behavior because the `point2Rad` variable is not defined in the code, and therefore the `cos` function would throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Math.PI` constant is used instead of the `point1Rad` and `point2Rad` variables, which would cause the `cos` function to return a different value.

DONE.
