  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.pop
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.pop` would remove the last element of the `ref` array, whereas `ref.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.shift` would remove the first element of the `ref` array, whereas `ref.unshift` would add an element to the beginning of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ref.splice(0, 0, <new element>)
```
This would result in different behavior because `ref.splice` would add a new element to the beginning of the `ref` array, whereas `ref.unshift` would add an element to the end of the array.

DONE.
