 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\..+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that starts with '/index.' followed by one or more characters, instead of matching only strings that end with '/index.[a-z]+'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[a-z]*/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches any string that starts with '/index.' followed by zero or more lowercase letters, instead of matching only strings that end with '/index.[a-z]+'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/\/index\.[A-Z]+$/, '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches only strings that end with '/index.[A-Z]+', instead of matching strings that end with '/index.[a-z]+'.

DONE.
