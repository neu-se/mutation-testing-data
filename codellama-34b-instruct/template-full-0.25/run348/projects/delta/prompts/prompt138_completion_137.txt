  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be satisfied if the peeked length is less than `firstLeft`, whereas the original condition requires the peeked length to be less than or equal to `firstLeft`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would be satisfied if the peeked length is greater than or equal to `firstLeft`, whereas the original condition requires the peeked length to be less than or equal to `firstLeft`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
