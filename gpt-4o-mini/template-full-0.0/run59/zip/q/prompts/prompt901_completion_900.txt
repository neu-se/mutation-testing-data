Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of a function will cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called with `null`, which may lead to a runtime error when trying to invoke the callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `undefined` instead of a valid function will also cause the `makeNodeResolver` method to be called with `undefined`, potentially resulting in a runtime error when the callback is expected to be invoked.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() { throw new Error("Custom error"); }
```
This would result in different behavior because replacing the placeholder with a function that throws an error will cause the promise to reject immediately with a "Custom error" instead of resolving or rejecting based on the original promise's outcome.

DONE.
