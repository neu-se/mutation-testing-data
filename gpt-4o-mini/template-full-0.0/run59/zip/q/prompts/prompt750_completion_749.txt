Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would trigger the rejection logic even when there are still pending promises, leading to a premature rejection of the overall promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only reject the promise if there is exactly one pending promise left, potentially allowing other fulfilled promises to be ignored if more than one promise is pending.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pendingCount !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise if there is any pending promise, regardless of how many promises are fulfilled, which is not the intended logic of waiting for all promises to settle.

DONE.
