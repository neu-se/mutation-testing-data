  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof otherOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `otherOp` is a number, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `otherOp` is a number or a string. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `otherOp` is a number, while the buggy code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `otherOp` is not null. This could potentially cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the `retain` property of `otherOp` is
