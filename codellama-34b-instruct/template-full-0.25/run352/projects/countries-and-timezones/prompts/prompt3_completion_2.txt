  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return `null` instead of an object, causing the `buildCountry` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `id` property of `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return `undefined` instead of an object, causing the `buildCountry` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `id` property of `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `getTimezonesMap` function would return an empty object instead of an object with the expected properties, causing the `buildCountry` function to throw a `TypeError` when trying to access the `id` property of an empty object.

DONE.
