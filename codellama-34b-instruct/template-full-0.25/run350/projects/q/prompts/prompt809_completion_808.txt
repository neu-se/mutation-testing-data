  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` is a function, so the condition would always be false, even if `callback` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply !== callback
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` is a function, so the condition would always be true, even if `callback` is not a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply === "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because `callback.apply` is a function, so the condition would always be true, even if `callback` is not a function.

DONE.
