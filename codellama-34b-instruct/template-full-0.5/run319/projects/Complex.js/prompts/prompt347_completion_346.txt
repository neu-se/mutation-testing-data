  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` have different values at different points in the complex plane, leading to different results for the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.tan` and `Math.sin` have different values at different points in the complex plane, leading to different results for the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.acos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.acos` and `Math.sin` have different values at different points in the complex plane, leading to different results for the `sinh` and `cosh` functions.

DONE.
