  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs =
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs.push` statement would be missing, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array would be mutated, causing the callback to be invoked with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello world"
```
This would result in different behavior because a string would be pushed onto the `nodeArgs` array, causing the callback to be invoked with a different type of argument.

DONE.
