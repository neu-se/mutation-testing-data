  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned the value `undefined`, while the modified code fragment would return the value `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned the value `undefined`, while the modified code fragment would return the value `42`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would have returned the value `undefined`, while the modified code fragment would return an empty array.

DONE.
