 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that always resolves to an empty array, instead of continuing the promise chain based on the yielded value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that always resolves to the value `42`, instead of continuing the promise chain based on the yielded value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a promise that always resolves to the `Q` object itself, instead of continuing the promise chain based on the yielded value.

DONE.
