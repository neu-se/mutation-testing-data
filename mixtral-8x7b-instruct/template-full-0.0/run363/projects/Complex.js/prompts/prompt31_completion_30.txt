 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the sign of the input `b`, which can affect the result of the `logHypot` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1 / b
```
This would result in different behavior because it calculates the reciprocal of `b`, which is not the same as the absolute value of `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it generates a random number instead of the absolute value of `b`.

DONE.
