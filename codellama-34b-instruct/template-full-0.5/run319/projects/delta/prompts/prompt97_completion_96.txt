  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always push the newOp to the end of the ops array, instead of inserting it at the correct position based on the attributes and length of the previous op.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always insert the newOp at the end of the ops array, instead of inserting it at the correct position based on the attributes and length of the previous op.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would randomly insert the newOp at a different position in the ops array each time, instead of inserting it at the correct position based on the attributes and length of the previous op.

DONE.
