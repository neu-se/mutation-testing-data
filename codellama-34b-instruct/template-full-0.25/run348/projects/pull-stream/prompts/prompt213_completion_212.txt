  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is set to an error object in the `if(abort)` block, while `null` is a constant that represents the absence of any value. If the `aborted` variable is not set, the `if(aborted)` block will not be executed, and the `map` function will not be called with the `abort` argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a constant that represents the absence of any value, while `aborted` is a variable that may or may not be set to an error object. If the `aborted` variable is not set, the `if(aborted)` block will not be executed, and the `map` function will not be called with the `abort` argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error()
```
This would
