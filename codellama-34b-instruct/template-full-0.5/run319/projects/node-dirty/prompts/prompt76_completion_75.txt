  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `1`, indicating that there is one key in the database, even if the database is empty.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `-1`, indicating that there is one key in the database, even if the database is empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a value of `null`, indicating that there are no keys in the database, even if the database is not empty.

DONE.
