  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment emits an error with a different message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Invalid row data'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment emits an error with a different message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error('Corrupted row data'));
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment emits an error with a specific message, while the new code fragment emits an error with a different message.

DONE.
