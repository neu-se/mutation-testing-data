  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands[2]
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands` is an array of two elements, and `operands[2]` would return `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
operands + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `operands` is an array, and adding 1 to an array would return a new array with one more element than the original array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners` is an array of functions that are called with progress updates, and `progressListeners.length` would return the number of progress listeners instead of the expected value.

DONE.
