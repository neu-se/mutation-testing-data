  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atReport` variable is used to keep track of the index of the reported unhandled rejection in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, and adding 1 to it would cause the reported unhandled rejection to be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atReport` variable is used to keep track of the index of the reported unhandled rejection in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array, and subtracting 1 from it would cause the reported unhandled rejection to be processed twice.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
atReport * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atReport` variable is used to keep track of the index of the reported unhandled rejection in the `reportedUnhandledRejections` array,
