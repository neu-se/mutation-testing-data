  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("get", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns a promise for the value of the property with the given key, while the new code fragment returns a promise for the value of the property with the given key, but only if the property exists.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("set", [key, value]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment sets the value of the property with the given key, while the new code fragment sets the value of the property with the given key, but only if the property exists.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("delete", [key]);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment deletes the property with the given key, while the new code fragment deletes the property with the given key, but only if the property exists.

DONE.
