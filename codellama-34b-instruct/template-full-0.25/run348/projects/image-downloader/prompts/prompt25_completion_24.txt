  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
__filename
```
This would result in different behavior because `__filename` returns the path of the current file, while `__dirname` returns the path of the current directory.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.dirname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.dirname()` returns the directory name of the path, while `__dirname` returns the directory name of the current file.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.basename(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because `path.basename()` returns the base name of the path, while `__dirname` returns the directory name of the current file.

DONE.
