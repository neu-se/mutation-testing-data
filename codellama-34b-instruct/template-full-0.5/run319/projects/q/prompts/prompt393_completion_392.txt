  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` creates a new rejected promise, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and would create a new pending promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.resolve` creates a new fulfilled promise, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and would create a new pending promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.all
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.all` takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when all of the promises in the array have resolved, whereas `Q` is a promise constructor and would create a new pending promise.

DONE.
