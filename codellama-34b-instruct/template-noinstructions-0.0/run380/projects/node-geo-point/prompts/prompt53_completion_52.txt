  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ + π
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ π` term would shift the bearing calculation by 180 degrees, which would cause the resulting bearing to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Δλ - π
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- π` term would shift the bearing calculation by -180 degrees, which would cause the resulting bearing to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * π - Δλ
```
This would result in different behavior because the `2 * π - Δλ` term would calculate the bearing as the difference between the two longitudes, which would be incorrect.

DONE.
