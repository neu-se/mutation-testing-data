Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the imaginary part is not equal to zero, which would incorrectly indicate that the complex number is not zero when it actually is.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real part is equal to one, which is unrelated to whether the complex number is zero, leading to incorrect results for zero complex numbers.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] + this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the sum of the real and imaginary parts is zero, which does not accurately determine if the complex number is zero, as both parts need to be zero independently.

DONE.
