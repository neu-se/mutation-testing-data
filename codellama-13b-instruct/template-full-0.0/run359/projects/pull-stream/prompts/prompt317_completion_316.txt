  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only call the callback function with the error argument set to `true` if the `ended` variable is `true`, but this code fragment would always call the callback function with the error argument set to `null` and the data argument set to `data`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(ended)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment would only call the callback function with the error argument set to `true` if the `ended` variable is `true`, but this code fragment would always call the callback function with the error argument set to `ended`.
