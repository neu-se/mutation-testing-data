  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' + 1
```
This change will cause the `fromObject` method to return a `GeoPoint` object with a longitude value that is one degree greater than the original longitude value. This change will not affect the behavior of the `fromGeoJSON` method, as it only uses the `coordinates` property of the `Point` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'longitude' - 1
```
This change will cause the `fromObject` method to return a `GeoPoint` object with a longitude value that is one degree less than the original longitude value. This change will not affect the behavior of the `fromGeoJSON` method, as it only uses the `coordinates` property of the `Point` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'latitude'
```
This change will cause the `fromObject` method to return a `GeoPoint` object with a latitude value that is equal to the
