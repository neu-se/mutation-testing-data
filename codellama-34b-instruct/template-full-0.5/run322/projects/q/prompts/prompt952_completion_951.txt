  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp.arguments
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp.arguments` is not a valid expression and would result in a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp[arguments]
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp[arguments]` would try to access a property on `thisp` with the name of the `arguments` object, which is not a valid property name and would result in a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisp[arguments[0]]
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisp[arguments[0]]` would try to access a property on `thisp` with the name of the first argument passed to the function, which may not be a valid property name and would result in a syntax error.

DONE.
