  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'number'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not the same as the `delete` property, and the code is checking for the presence of the `delete` property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.insert === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` property is not the same as the `delete` property, and the code is checking for the presence of the `delete` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof nextOp.retain === 'object' && nextOp.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `retain` property is not the same as the `delete` property, and the code is checking for the presence of the `delete` property.

DONE.
