  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, if we replace it with `index > 0`, it will check if the index is positive, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, if we replace it with `index === 0`, it will check if the index is equal to 0, which may cause the code to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the index is less than 0, which means it is checking if the index is negative. However, if we replace it with `index
