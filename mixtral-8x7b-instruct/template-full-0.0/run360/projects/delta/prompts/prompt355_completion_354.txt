 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `transform` method to accept `undefined` values, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
arg !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `transform` method to accept `null` values, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
typeof arg === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only allow objects to be passed to the `transform` method, whereas the original code allows both numbers and objects.

DONE.
