  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid file name, and it will cause an error to be thrown by the `fs.readFileSync` method, which will make the test fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because `''` is an empty string, and it will cause an error to be thrown by the `JSON.parse` method, which will make the test fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a valid file name, and it will cause an error to be thrown by the `fs.readFileSync` method, which will make the test fail.

DONE.
