  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to `x + 1` instead of `x`, which would change the output of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to `x * 2` instead of `x`, which would change the output of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x / 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function would be applied to `x / 2` instead of `x`, which would change the output of the function.

DONE.
