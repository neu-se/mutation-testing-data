  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(hours)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `hours` variable to `getNumStr` instead of `min`, which would cause the function to return a different string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(min)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `min` variable to `getNumStr` instead of `hours`, which would cause the function to return a different string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
getNumStr(hours + min)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the sum of `hours` and `min` to `getNumStr`, which would cause the function to return a different string.

DONE.
