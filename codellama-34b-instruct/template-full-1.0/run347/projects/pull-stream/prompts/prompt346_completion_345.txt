  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.execute
```
This would result in different behavior because `execute` is not a valid function in the `key` object. The original code uses `exec`, which is a valid function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.test
```
This would result in different behavior because `test` is not a valid function in the `key` object. The original code uses `exec`, which is a valid function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is not a valid function in the `key` object. The original code uses `exec`, which is a valid function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the pattern matches the string or not.

DONE.
