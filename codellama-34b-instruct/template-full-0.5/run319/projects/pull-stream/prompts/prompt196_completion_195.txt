  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!abort
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the `abort` variable, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` even if `abort` is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would evaluate to `true` only if both `abort` and `true` are truthy, which would never be the case if `abort` is `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to `false` only if both `abort` and `false` are falsy, which would never be the case if `abort` is `true`.

DONE.
