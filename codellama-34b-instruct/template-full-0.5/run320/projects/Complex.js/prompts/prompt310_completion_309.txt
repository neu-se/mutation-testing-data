  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would always return the same value, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a different value depending on the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would return a different value depending on the input.

DONE.
