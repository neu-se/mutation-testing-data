  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `reject` would cause the promise to be rejected, whereas `dispatch` would cause it to be fulfilled.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("reject")
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of the `reject` method, whereas `reject` would cause it to be rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).dispatch("resolve")
```
This would result in different behavior because `dispatch` would cause the promise to be fulfilled with the value of the `resolve` method, whereas `resolve` would cause it to be fulfilled with the value of the `object` parameter.

DONE.
