  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, potentially skipping the end callback.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with a different argument, potentially calling the end callback multiple times.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
end && false
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `once` function to be called with `false` instead of `end`, potentially skipping the end callback.

DONE.
