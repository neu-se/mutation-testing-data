  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to calculate the offset, while `0` would always return 0 as the offset, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to calculate the offset, while `-length` would return the negative of the length, resulting in incorrect behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `length` is used to calculate the offset, while `length + 1` would return the length plus 1, resulting in incorrect behavior.

DONE.
