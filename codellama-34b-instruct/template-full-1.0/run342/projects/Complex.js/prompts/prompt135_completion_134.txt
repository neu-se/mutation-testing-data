  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() || !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either `this` or `z` is not infinite, whereas the original code would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if both `this` and `z` are infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isInfinite']() && !z['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return `Complex['INFINITY']` if both `this` and `z` are not infinite, whereas the original code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if either `this` or `z` is infinite.
