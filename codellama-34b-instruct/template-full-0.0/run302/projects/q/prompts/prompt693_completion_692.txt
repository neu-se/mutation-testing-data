  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first two arguments to the `dispatch` method, instead of all the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first argument and pass all the remaining arguments to the `dispatch` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the first three arguments to the `dispatch` method, instead of all the arguments.

DONE.
