Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` instead of `options` would cause the `getCountry` function to not receive any options, potentially leading to unexpected results when accessing properties like `deprecated` in the `deliverCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ deprecated: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because providing an options object with `deprecated: true` would change the behavior of the `deliverCountry` function, causing it to return `country.allTimezones` instead of `country.timezones`, which may not be the intended behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ invalidOption: 'test' }
```
This would result in different behavior because passing an options object with an unexpected property (`invalidOption`) would not affect the logic in `deliverCountry`, but it could lead to confusion or errors if the function is later modified to check for specific options, potentially breaking the expected functionality.

DONE.
