  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(ends.resolve);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` promise would be resolved immediately with the value of `ends.resolve`, rather than being resolved later with the value of `ends.promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(ends.promise.get("head"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` promise would be resolved with the value of `ends.promise.get("head")`, rather than being resolved with the value of `ends.promise`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var closed = Q.defer(ends.promise.get("tail"));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `closed` promise would be resolved with the value of `ends.promise.get("tail")`, rather than being resolved with the value of `ends.promise`.

DONE.
