  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put"
```
This would result in different behavior because "put" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the function would send a PUT request instead of a POST request.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because "get" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the function would send a GET request instead of a POST request.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because "delete" is a different HTTP method than "post", and the function would send a DELETE request instead of a POST request.

DONE.
