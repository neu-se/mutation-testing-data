  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `s` is not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `s` is not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof s !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `s` is an object, while the new code fragment checks if `s` is not an object.

DONE.
