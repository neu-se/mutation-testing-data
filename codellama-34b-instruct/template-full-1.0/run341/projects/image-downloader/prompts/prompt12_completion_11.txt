  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the string starting from the second character of `pathname`, whereas the original code fragment would return the entire `pathname`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the uppercase version of `pathname`, whereas the original code fragment would return the original string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pathname.split('/').pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the last part of `pathname` after splitting it by `/`, whereas the original code fragment would return the entire `pathname`.

DONE.
