  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions && {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the expression would be evaluated as `(archiverOptions && {}) || {}`, which would always return an empty object `{}` if `archiverOptions` is truthy, regardless of its value. In contrast, the original code fragment `archiverOptions || {}` would return `archiverOptions` if it is truthy, or an empty object `{}` if it is falsy.
