  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the minimum of the two lengths, while this code calculates the sum.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() - otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the minimum of the two lengths, while this code calculates the difference.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() - thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code calculates the minimum of the two lengths, while this code calculates the difference in the opposite direction.

DONE.
