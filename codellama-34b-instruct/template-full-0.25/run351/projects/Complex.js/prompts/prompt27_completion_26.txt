  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this modified code fragment would throw a TypeError.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this modified code fragment would throw a TypeError.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'Invalid Param' / 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws a SyntaxError, while this modified code fragment would throw a TypeError.

DONE.
