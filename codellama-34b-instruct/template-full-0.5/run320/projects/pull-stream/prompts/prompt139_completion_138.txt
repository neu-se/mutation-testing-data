  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value used to indicate the absence of any defined value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!end
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `end` is a boolean value, while `!end` is the negation of that boolean value.

DONE.
