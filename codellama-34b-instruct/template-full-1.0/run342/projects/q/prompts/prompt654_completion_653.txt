  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply(object, array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because `fapply` is a deprecated alias for the `apply` method in Q.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).apply(void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `apply` method on the `Q` function, which is not the same as using `dispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.dispatch(object, "apply", array_slice(arguments, 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the `dispatch` method on the `Q` function with a different operation name, which could affect the outcome of the operation.

DONE.
