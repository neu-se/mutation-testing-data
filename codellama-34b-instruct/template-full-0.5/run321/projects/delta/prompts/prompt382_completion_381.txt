  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next()` returns the next operation in the `other` iterator, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a value to be passed to the `next()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter.next()` returns the next operation in the `this` iterator, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a value to be passed to the `next()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a valid value to be passed to the `next()` method, whereas `<PLACEHOLDER>` is a placeholder for a value to be passed to the `next()` method.

DONE.
