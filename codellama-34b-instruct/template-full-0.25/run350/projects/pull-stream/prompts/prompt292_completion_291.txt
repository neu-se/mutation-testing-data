  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return `false` for all items, even if they are unique.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return `false` for all items, even if they are unique.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
field, !field
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nonUnique` function would return `false` for all items, even if they are unique.

DONE.
