  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `ctx`, is an object with a specific meaning in the context of the rule's implementation, whereas `null` is a null value that would not provide the same meaning.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `ctx`, is an object with a specific meaning in the context of the rule's implementation, whereas `undefined` is a value that would not provide the same meaning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment, `ctx`, is an object with a specific meaning in the context of the rule's implementation, whereas `1` is a number that would not provide the same meaning.

DONE.
