  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would cause the `data` variable to be incremented by 1, which would change the output of the `console.log` statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator would cause the `data` variable to be decremented by 1, which would change the output of the `console.log` statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would cause the `data` variable to be multiplied by 2, which would change the output of the `console.log` statement.

DONE.
