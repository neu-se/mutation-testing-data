  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
addRule(/[^aeiou]y$/i, function(w) { return w.substr(0, w.length - 1) + 'ies' })
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression has been modified to only match words that end with a consonant followed by "y", rather than words that end with "y" or "quy". This would cause the function to return the incorrect plural form for words that end with "quy".
