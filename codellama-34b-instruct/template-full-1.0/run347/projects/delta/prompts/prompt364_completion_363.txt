  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekNext())
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekNext` checks if there is a next operation, whereas `peekType` checks the type of the next operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekNext(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekNext` is not a function, and `<PLACEHOLDER>` is not a valid argument for `peekType`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
if (otherIter.peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>))
```
This would result in different behavior because `peekType(<PLACEHOLDER>)` checks if the next operation has the same type as `<PLACEHOLDER>`, whereas `peekType()` checks the type of the next operation.

DONE.
