  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).inspect.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(object).inspect` is a function, and `Q(object).inspect.call(null)` is a function call that returns the result of calling the `inspect` function with `null` as the `this` value. In the original code, the `inspect` function is called with `object` as the `this` value, which is likely to produce different results.
