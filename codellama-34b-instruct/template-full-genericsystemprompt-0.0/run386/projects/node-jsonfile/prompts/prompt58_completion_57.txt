  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL + EOL
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra newline character at the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the newline character at the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
EOL.repeat(2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add two newline characters at the end of the string, which is not the intended behavior of the original code.

DONE.
