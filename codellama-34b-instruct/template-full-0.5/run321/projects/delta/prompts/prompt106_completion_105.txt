  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => { return index % 2 === 0; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would only return true for even-indexed operations, whereas the original predicate function would return true for all operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => { return index > 0 && op.attributes != null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would only return true for operations with non-null attributes, whereas the original predicate function would return true for all operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(op: Op, index: number) => { return op.insert != null && op.attributes == null; }
```
This would result in different behavior because the predicate function would only return true for insert operations with null attributes, whereas the original predicate function would return true for all operations.

DONE.
