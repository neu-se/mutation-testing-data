  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `stringify` is a depth limit, and passing a value of 1 would cause the function to only stringify the top-level properties of the object, rather than recursively stringifying all nested properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `stringify` is a depth limit, and passing a value of 0 would cause the function to stringify the entire object, including all nested properties, rather than just the top-level properties.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, Infinity)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument to `stringify` is a depth limit, and passing a value of Infinity would cause the function to stringify the entire object, including all nested properties, rather than just the top-level
