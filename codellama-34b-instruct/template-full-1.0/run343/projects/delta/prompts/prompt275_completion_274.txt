  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.seek
```
This would result in different behavior because `seek` is a function that moves the iterator to a specific position in the delta, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation without moving the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `next` moves the iterator to the next position in the delta, whereas `peekType` returns the type of the next operation without moving the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the next operation in the `other` delta, rather than the main delta.

DONE.
