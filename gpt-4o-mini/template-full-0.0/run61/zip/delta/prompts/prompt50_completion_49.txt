Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b[embedType]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to access the property of `b` using the `embedType` variable, which could lead to an undefined value if `embedType` does not match any property in `b`, causing the error message to be misleading.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would incorrectly check the second key of object `b`, which may not exist, leading to a potential error or incorrect behavior when the objects have fewer than two keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)[0] + '1'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would concatenate '1' to the `embedType`, causing the comparison to always fail, resulting in an error message indicating that the embed types do not match, even when they are the same.

DONE.
