 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'xeno', 'xenos'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original rule was for a specific string, while this new rule uses a regular expression that can match other words not intended by the original rule.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/memo$/i, function(w) { return w + 's' }
