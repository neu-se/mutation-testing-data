  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new `defer` object, but this replacement code fragment calls the `defer` function without assigning the resulting promise to a variable, which would result in an `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer.promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new `defer` object, but this replacement code fragment returns the `promise` property of the `defer` function, which would result in an `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning` error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code creates a new `defer` object, but this replacement code fragment creates a new `defer` object using the `Q` library, which could potentially result in different behavior if the `Q` library is handling promises differently
