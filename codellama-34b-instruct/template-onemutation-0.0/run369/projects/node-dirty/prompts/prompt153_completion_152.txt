  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.cork();
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cork` method is called twice, which would cause the write stream to be corked twice, and the `uncork` method would only be called once, leading to a mismatch in the number of corks and uncorks.

DONE.
