  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'write_close'` event when the write stream is closed, while the mutated code would emit a `'write_error'` event instead, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'write_close'` event when the write stream is closed, while the mutated code would emit a `'write_drain'` event instead, which could cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting this behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write_end'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits a `'write_close'` event when the write stream is closed, while the mutated code would emit a `'write_end'` event instead, which could cause the test suite to
