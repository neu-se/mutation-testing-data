  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete(key);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the key from the map instead of setting a new value for it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val + 1);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to `val + 1` instead of just `val`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, Math.random());
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the key to a random number instead of just `val`.

DONE.
