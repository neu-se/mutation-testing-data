  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it as a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so the code would throw a `TypeError` when trying to call it as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the empty function would not have the same behavior as the original `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` function, which would affect the behavior of the surrounding code.

DONE.
