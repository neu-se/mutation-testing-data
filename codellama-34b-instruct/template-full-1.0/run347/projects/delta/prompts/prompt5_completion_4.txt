  Sure, I can help you with that!

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the length of the `keepNull` array instead of its value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull.includes(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `keepNull` array includes `undefined` instead of checking if it's falsey.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull.indexOf(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would find the index of `undefined` in the `keepNull` array instead of checking if it's falsey.

DONE.
