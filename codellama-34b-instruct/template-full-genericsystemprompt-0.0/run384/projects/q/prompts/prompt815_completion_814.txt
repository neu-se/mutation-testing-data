  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Buggy code");
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error instead of returning a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.reject(reason);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reject the promise instead of returning a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Q.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would resolve the promise instead of returning a promise.

DONE.
