  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, so if the `src` is a glob, it would be treated as a directory instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) && src.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would only evaluate to true if `src` is a glob and has a length greater than 0.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src) || src.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would evaluate to true if `src` is a glob or has a length of 0.

DONE.
