 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/nuclei|syllabi|foci|fungi|cacti/i, function(w) { return w + 'i' }
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches the plural forms instead of the singular forms, and the function adds an extra 'i' to the end of the word instead of replacing the last two letters with 'i'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
/nucleus|syllabus|focus|fungus|cactus/g, function(w) { return w.replace(/(us|i)$/, 'i') }
