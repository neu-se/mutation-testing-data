  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would include the first argument in the slice, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first argument from the slice, which is not what the original code intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_slice(arguments, 3)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would exclude the first two arguments from the slice, which is not what the original code intended.

DONE.
