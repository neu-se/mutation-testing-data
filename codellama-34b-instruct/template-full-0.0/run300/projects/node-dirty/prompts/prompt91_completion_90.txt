  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'warning'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would trigger a different event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'info'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would trigger a different event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'debug'
```
This would result in different behavior because the event name is different, and the `emit` method would trigger a different event.

DONE.
