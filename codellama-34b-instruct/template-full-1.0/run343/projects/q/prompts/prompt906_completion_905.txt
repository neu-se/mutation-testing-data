  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for the presence of an argument, whereas this change checks for the absence of an argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof callback !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a truthy value, whereas this change checks for a value that is a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(callback)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks for a truthy value, whereas this change checks for a value that is an array.

DONE.
