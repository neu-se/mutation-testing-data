  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `firstLeft` is the number of characters left to be processed in the current operation. Using `peekLength()` instead of `firstLeft` would cause the loop to iterate more times than necessary, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength() > firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `peekLength()` method returns the length of the next operation in the iterator, while `firstLeft` is the number of characters left to be processed in the current operation. Using `peekLength()` instead of `firstLeft` would cause the loop to iterate more times than necessary, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior
