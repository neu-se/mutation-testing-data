  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.reject` would reject the promise, whereas `deferred.notify` would notify progress.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.resolve` would resolve the promise, whereas `deferred.notify` would notify progress.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.progress
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.progress` would notify progress, whereas `deferred.notify` would notify progress.

DONE.
