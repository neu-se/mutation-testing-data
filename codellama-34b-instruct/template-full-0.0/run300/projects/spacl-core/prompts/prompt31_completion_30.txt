  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\` character to match the end of the string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\w+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\w+` character class to match one or more word characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\W+'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `$` character to match the end of the string, while the new code fragment uses the `\W+` character class to match one or more non-word characters.

DONE.
