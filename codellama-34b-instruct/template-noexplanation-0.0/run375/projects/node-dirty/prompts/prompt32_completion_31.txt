  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key + 1
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key, which may not be immediately apparent in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key - 1
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key, which may not be immediately apparent in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key * 2
```
This change will cause the `set` method to store the value at the wrong key, which may not be immediately apparent in the test suite.

DONE.
