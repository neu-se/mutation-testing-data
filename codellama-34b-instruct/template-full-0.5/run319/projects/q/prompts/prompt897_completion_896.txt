  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a function as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver`, which is used as the callback for the Node function. By passing `null` instead, the callback function is not passed, which could cause issues if the Node function expects a callback to be passed.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code passes a function as the first argument to `makeNodeResolver`, which is used as the callback for the Node function. By passing an empty function instead, the callback function is not passed, which could cause issues if the Node function expects a callback to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
        deferred.reject(err);
    } else {
