  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function expects a string argument, but here it is passed an undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the code to enter the `else` block when the input is not a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is a string, so `src[0]` would return the first character of the string, which may not be a glob pattern.

DONE.
