Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
point === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it only checks if `point` is strictly equal to `null`, which would pass for any non-null object, thus not catching cases where `point` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof point === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `point` is a string instead of an object, which would incorrectly allow string inputs to pass through without throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(point)
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `point` is an array, which would incorrectly allow array inputs to pass through without throwing an error, even though the function expects an object.

DONE.
