  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i < this.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the last element of the array, which may cause the `indexOf` function to return incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i > this.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to never run, which means that the `indexOf` function would always return -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i += 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the loop to skip every other element of the array, which may cause the `indexOf` function to return incorrect results.

DONE.
