 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Object.create
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.create` creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties, while `Object.assign` copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. In this case, the behavior of the `getAllCountries` function would change, as it would return an object with a prototype of the first country object instead of a plain object containing all country objects.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
spread operator (...)
```
This would result in different behavior because the spread operator expands an iterable object into individual elements, while `Object.assign` copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. In this case, the behavior of the `getAllCountries` function would change, as it would return an array of country objects instead of an object containing country objects with their respective ids as keys.
