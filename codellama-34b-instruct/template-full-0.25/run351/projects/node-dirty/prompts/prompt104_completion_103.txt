  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a method that removes a key and its value from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the map.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.clear
```
This would result in different behavior because `clear` is a method that removes all key-value pairs from the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the map.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.add
```
This would result in different behavior because `add` is a method that adds a key and its value to the map, whereas `set` is a method that sets a key and its value in the map.

DONE.
