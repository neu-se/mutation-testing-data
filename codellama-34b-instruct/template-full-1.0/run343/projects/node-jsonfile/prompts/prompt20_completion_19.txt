  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding
```
This would result in different behavior because the `encoding` property is not always present in the `options` object, and accessing it would throw an error in such cases.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"encoding"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the string "encoding" instead of the intended encoding value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.encoding || "utf8"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would default to the "utf8" encoding instead of the intended encoding value, which could lead to incorrect parsing of the JSON file.

DONE.
