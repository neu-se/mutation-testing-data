  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/g, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag is added, which makes the regular expression match all occurrences of `a` in the string, instead of just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression is now case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase `a` characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/a/i, 'e'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag is added, which makes the regular expression case-insensitive, so it would match both uppercase and lowercase `a` characters.

DONE.
