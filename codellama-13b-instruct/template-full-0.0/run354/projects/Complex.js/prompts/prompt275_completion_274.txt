  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is used to calculate the sine of the complex number, while the `cos` function is used to calculate the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is used to calculate the sine of the complex number, while the `tan` function is used to calculate the tangent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function is used to calculate the sine of the complex number, while the `sinh` function is used to calculate the hyperbolic sine.

DONE.
