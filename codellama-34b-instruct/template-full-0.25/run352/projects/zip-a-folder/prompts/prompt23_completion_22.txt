  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.file` is a method that creates a new file entry in the archive, whereas `archiver` is a constructor function that creates a new archiver instance.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.directory
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.directory` is a method that creates a new directory entry in the archive, whereas `archiver` is a constructor function that creates a new archiver instance.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiver.finalize
```
This would result in different behavior because `archiver.finalize` is a method that finalizes the archive, whereas `archiver` is a constructor function that creates a new archiver instance.

DONE.
