  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w != 'dwarf' && w != 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for all words, which would cause all of the plural forms to be appended with "es".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w !== 'dwarf' || w !== 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return true for all words except "dwarf" and "roof", which would cause all of the plural forms to be appended with "es" except for those two words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w === 'dwarf' || w === 'roof'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only return true for the words "dwarf" and "roof", which would cause only those two plural forms to be appended with "es".

DONE.
