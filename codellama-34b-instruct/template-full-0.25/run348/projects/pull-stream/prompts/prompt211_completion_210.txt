This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `aborted` is a variable that is defined in the function, and it is used to indicate that the operation has been aborted. Replacing it with `null` would cause the function to behave differently, as it would not be able to detect the abortion of the operation.

```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a boolean value that indicates that the operation has not been aborted. Replacing `aborted` with `false` would cause the function to behave differently, as it would not be
