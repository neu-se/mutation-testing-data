  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a value to `makeNodeResolver`, which is used as the `this` value for the function. In contrast, passing `null` would cause the function to be called with a `this` value of `null`, which could potentially break the function's behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a value to `makeNodeResolver`, which is used as the `this` value for the function. In contrast, passing `undefined` would cause the function to be called with a `this` value of `undefined`, which could potentially break the function's behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes a value to `makeNodeResolver`, which
