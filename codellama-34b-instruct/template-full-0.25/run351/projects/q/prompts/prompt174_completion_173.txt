  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be incremented by 1, which would cause the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be decremented by 1, which would cause the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number would be doubled, which would cause the stack trace to point to the wrong line.

DONE.
