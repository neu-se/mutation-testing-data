  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function, but this would return the value 42.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function, but this would return null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a function, but this would return true.

DONE.
