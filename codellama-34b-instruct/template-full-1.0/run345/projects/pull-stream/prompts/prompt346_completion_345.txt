  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `key.match` will return an array of matches, while `key.exec` returns a single match.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the value of the `key` parameter with the first character removed, while the original code fragment would return the value of the `key` parameter as is.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
key.map(function(x) { return x.toUpperCase(); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of strings, where each string is the uppercase version of the original string.

DONE.
