  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close()
```
This code fragment is the same as the original code fragment, and it will have the same behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close(true)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it will call the `close` method with an additional argument `true`. This may cause the `close` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain', () => this.close(false)
```
This code fragment is similar to the original code fragment, but it will call the `close` method with an additional argument `false`. This may cause the `close` method to behave differently, depending on how it is implemented.

DONE.
