  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Delta.ops.unshift(other.ops[0])

This would result in different behavior because it would prepend the first operation from the other Delta to the ops array of the current Delta, regardless of whether it is supposed to be deleted or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
retDelta.push({ insert: `This is a test!` });

This would result in different behavior because it would insert a new operation into the retDelta rather than performing the intended deletion.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
Delta.ops.push(newOp);

This would result in different behavior because it would append the newOp to the ops array of the current Delta, instead of performing the intended deletion.

DONE.
