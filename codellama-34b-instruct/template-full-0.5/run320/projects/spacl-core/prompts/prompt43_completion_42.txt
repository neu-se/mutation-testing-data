  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(true)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flatten` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flatten` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
flatten(min < 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `flatten` function to be called with a different argument, which could potentially change the behavior of the function.

DONE.
