  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q.resolve("some value")```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the same value "some value" instead of the original callback's value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```null```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause a null reference error when the null value is used as a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```this```
This would result in different behavior because it would refer to the global object instead of the original callback's object.

DONE.
