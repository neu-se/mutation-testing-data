  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$(this).text().trim();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `text()` method, which returns the text content of the element, while the new code fragment uses the `text` property, which returns the text content of the element, including any child elements.

DONE.
