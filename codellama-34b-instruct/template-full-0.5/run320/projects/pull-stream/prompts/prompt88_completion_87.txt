  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because `!prop` is the logical negation of `prop`, which means that the test will pass if `prop` is falsy, and fail if `prop` is truthy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop + 1` is a different value than `prop`, which means that the test will pass if `prop` is not equal to the expected value, and fail if `prop` is equal to the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because `prop * 2` is a different value than `prop`, which means that the test will pass if `prop` is not equal to the expected value, and fail if `prop` is equal to the expected value.

DONE.
