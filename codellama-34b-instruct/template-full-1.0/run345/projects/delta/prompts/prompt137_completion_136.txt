  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to run indefinitely if firstOther was null, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to run indefinitely if firstOther.retain was null, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof firstOther.retain === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the while loop to run indefinitely if firstOther.retain was a string, potentially leading to an infinite loop.

DONE.
