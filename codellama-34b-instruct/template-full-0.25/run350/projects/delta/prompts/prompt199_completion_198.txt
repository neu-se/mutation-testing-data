  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice(1)` would return a new array with the first element removed, whereas `rest` returns the remaining elements of the array as a new array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because `pop()` would remove and return the last element of the array, whereas `rest` returns the remaining elements of the array as a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.rest.shift()
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift()` would remove and return the first element of the array, whereas `rest` returns the remaining elements of the array as a new array.

DONE.
