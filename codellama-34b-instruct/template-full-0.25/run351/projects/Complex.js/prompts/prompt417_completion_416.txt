  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite()` checks if the complex number is infinite, while `isZero()` checks if it is zero.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!this['isZero']()
```
This would result in different behavior because `!` negates the result of `isZero()`, so the code would return `Complex['INFINITY']` if the complex number is not zero, rather than if it is zero.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['re'] === 0 && this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the real and imaginary parts of the complex number are both zero, rather than checking if the complex number itself is zero.

DONE.
