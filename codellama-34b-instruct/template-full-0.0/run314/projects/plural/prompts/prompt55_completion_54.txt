  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(regex, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement, while this new code fragment uses the `replace` method with a string replacement and a regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement, while this new code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a regular expression replacement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.replace(/ves$/, 'ves')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a string replacement, while this new code fragment uses the `replace` method with a regular expression and a regular expression replacement.

DONE.
