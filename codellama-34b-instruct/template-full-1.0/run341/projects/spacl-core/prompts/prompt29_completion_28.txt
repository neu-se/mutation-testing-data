  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.reverse()` would return a reversed version of the `parts` array, whereas `parts.reduce()` would return a single value obtained by combining the elements of the `parts` array using the given combine function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.length
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.length` would return the length of the `parts` array, whereas `parts.reduce()` would return a single value obtained by combining the elements of the `parts` array using the given combine function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parts.slice()
```
This would result in different behavior because `parts.slice()` would return a copy of the `parts` array, whereas `parts.reduce()` would return a single value obtained by combining the elements of the `parts` array using the given combine function.

DONE.
