  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the method called on the object from `post` to `get`, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value or error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [nodeArgs, name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the order of the arguments passed to the `post` method, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value or error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add an extra argument to the `post` method call, which could potentially cause the function to return a different value or error.

DONE.
