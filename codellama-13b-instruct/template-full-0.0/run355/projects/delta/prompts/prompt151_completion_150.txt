  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition of 1 to the result of the subtraction would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a non-zero argument, which would result in the `otherOp` being pushed onto the `ops` array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction of 1 from the result of the subtraction would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be called with a zero argument, which would result in the `otherOp` not being pushed onto the `ops` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain - firstLeft * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the multiplication of 2 by the result of the subtraction would cause the `otherIter.next()` method to be
