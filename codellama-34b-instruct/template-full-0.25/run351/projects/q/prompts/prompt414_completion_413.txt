  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `a` property of the `object` instead of the `object` itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the first element of the `object` instead of the `object` itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would access the `b` property of the `object` instead of the `object` itself.

DONE.
