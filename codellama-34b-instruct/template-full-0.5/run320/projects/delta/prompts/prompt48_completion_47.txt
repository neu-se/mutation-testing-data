  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to the first key in `b`, even if `b` has multiple keys.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!embedType || embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to the first key in `b`, even if `b` has multiple keys.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
embedType !== Object.keys(b)[0] && embedType !== Object.keys(b)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true` when `embedType` is not equal to the first or second key in `b`, even if `b` has multiple keys.

DONE.
