  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 <PLACEHOLDER> = this.ops.length - 1;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the last op in the array, rather than the op at the current index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 <PLACEHOLDER> = this.ops.length;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always choose the next op in the array, rather than the op at the current index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 <PLACEHOLDER> = Math.floor(Math.random() * this.ops.length);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would choose a random op in the array, rather than the op at the current index.

DONE.
