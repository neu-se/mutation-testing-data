  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing the variable `a` by itself, which would always result in 1, regardless of the value of `b`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing the variable `b` by a different value, which could result in a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would be dividing the sum of `a` and `b` by `a`, which could result in a different result.

DONE.
