  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to 1, rather than when `b` is equal to -1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when `b` is not equal to -1, rather than when `b` is equal to -1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `b` is equal to 0, rather than when `b` is equal to -1.

DONE.
