  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor === Object
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if `s` is an object, but not necessarily a plain object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && typeof s.valueOf() === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the value of `s` is an object, but not necessarily a plain object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s && s.constructor.name === 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the constructor of `s` is the `Object` constructor, but not necessarily a plain object.

DONE.
