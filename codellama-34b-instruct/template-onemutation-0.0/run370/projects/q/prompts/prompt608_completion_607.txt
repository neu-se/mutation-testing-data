  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the arguments to the `promiseDispatch` method without the first argument, which is the `deferred.resolve` function. This would cause the promise to never be resolved and the `dispatch` method to never return a value.
