  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.toUpperCase() }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the word in all uppercase letters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.split('').reverse().join('') }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the word with its letters reversed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w.length }
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the word unchanged, while this new code fragment returns the length of the word.

DONE.
