  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected + true>
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `<rejected + true>` would evaluate to a falsy value, even if `rejected` is truthy, making the ternary operator return the value of `this` instead of the expected behavior of accepting the rejection reason.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected + ''>
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `<rejected + ''>` would concatenate the string `'rejected'` with an empty string, making the ternary operator always return the value of `this`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<rejected ? 1 : 0>
```
This would result in different behavior because the expression `<rejected ? 1 : 0>` would always return the value `1`, making the ternary operator never accept the rejection reason.

DONE.
