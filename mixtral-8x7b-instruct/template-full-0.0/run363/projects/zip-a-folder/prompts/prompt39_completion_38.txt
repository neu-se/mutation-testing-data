 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
'./'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to zip the current directory instead of using the provided `src` path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause an error when checking if `src` is a glob, potentially skipping the globbing process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
() => src
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a function that always returns `src` instead of the actual `src` value. This could lead to unexpected results when processing globs or directory paths.

DONE.
