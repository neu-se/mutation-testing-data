  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject` would immediately reject the promise, whereas `Q` would return a promise that would be fulfilled with the value `Q`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` would not have a `then` method, and would therefore cause an error when `then` is called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would not have a `then` method, and would therefore cause an error when `then` is called on it.

DONE.
