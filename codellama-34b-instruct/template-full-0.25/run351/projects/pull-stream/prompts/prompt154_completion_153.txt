  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort()
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort` is a function, and calling it would execute the function, whereas the original code fragment `onAbort` simply refers to the function without executing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.call(this)` would execute the `onAbort` function with `this` set to the current context, whereas the original code fragment `onAbort` simply refers to the function without executing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
onAbort.apply(this, arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `onAbort.apply(this, arguments)` would execute the `onAbort` function with `this` set to the current context and the `arguments` object set to the current arguments, whereas the original code fragment `onAbort` simply refers to the function
