  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a non-numeric value that would not be truthy, so it would not emit the "unhandledRejection" event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Infinity
```
This would result in different behavior because `Infinity` is a numeric value that would be truthy, so it would emit the "unhandledRejection" event.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, so it would not emit the "unhandledRejection" event.

DONE.
