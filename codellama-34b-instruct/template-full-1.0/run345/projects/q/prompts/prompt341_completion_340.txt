  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 Q.defer();
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` returns a new deferred object, which might not have the same state as the one used in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(null)` returns a new deferred object with a null value, which is not the same as the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer(defer);
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer(defer)` returns a new deferred object with the same value as the original `defer` object, which is not the same as the original code.

DONE.
