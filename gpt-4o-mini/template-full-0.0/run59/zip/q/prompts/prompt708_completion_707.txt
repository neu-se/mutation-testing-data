Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it only accesses the first argument of the `arguments` object instead of creating an array from all the arguments passed to the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.from(arguments)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.from` creates a new array from the `arguments` object, which may not behave the same way as `array_slice` if the original intent was to slice the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
arguments.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the number of arguments passed to the function instead of the actual arguments themselves, which would lead to incorrect handling of the function's parameters.

DONE.
