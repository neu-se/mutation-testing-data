  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cell'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "cell", which is "cellos", while the new code fragment would return the singular form "cell".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "cello", which is "cellos", while the new code fragment would return the singular form "cello".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'cello's'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the plural form of "cello", which is "cellos", while the new code fragment would return the plural form "cello's".

DONE.
