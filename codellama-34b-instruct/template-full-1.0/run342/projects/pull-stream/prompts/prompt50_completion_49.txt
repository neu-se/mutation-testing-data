  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source()
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source()` would always return a function, while the original code fragment would have evaluated to `true` if `s` is a function and `false` if it's not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.sink
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.sink` would always return a function, while the original code fragment would have evaluated to `true` if `s` is a function and `false` if it's not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
s.source === s
```
This would result in different behavior because `s.source === s` would always return `false`, while the original code fragment would have evaluated to `true` if `s` is a function and `false` if it's not.

DONE.
