  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).then
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is used to handle errors, while the `then` method is used to handle successful resolution of the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).catch
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is used to handle errors, while the `catch` method is used to handle errors and successful resolution of the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.fapply(nodeArgs).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fail` method is used to handle errors, while the `finally` method is used to handle both successful resolution of the promise and errors.

DONE.
