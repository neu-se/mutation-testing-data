  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a different variable than `b`, and it may not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `b + 1` is a different value than `b`, and it may not be a valid key for the `Object.keys()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)[1]
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys(a)[1]` is a different key than `Object.keys(b)[0]`, and it may not be a valid key for the `a` object.

DONE.
