  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'toTile' method would be called on null instead of the 'GeoPoint' instance, which would cause an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'toTile' method would be called on undefined instead of the 'GeoPoint' instance, which would cause an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'toTile' method would be called on an empty object instead of the 'GeoPoint' instance, which would cause an error.

DONE.
