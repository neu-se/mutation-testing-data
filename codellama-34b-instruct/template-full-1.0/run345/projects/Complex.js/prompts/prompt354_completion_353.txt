  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different variable and would return a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different expression and would return a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it is a different expression and would return a different value.

DONE.
