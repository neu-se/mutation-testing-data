  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value + 1;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise plus 1, rather than the original promise itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function (value) {
    return value * 2;
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new promise that is resolved with the value of the original promise multiplied by 2, rather than the original promise itself.

DONE.
