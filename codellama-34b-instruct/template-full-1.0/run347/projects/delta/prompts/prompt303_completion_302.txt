  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the `other` delta's operations and return the next one, instead of returning the current operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.prev()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would iterate through the `other` delta's operations in reverse and return the previous one, instead of returning the current operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.peek()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the current operation without iterating through the `other` delta's operations, causing the code to behave differently.

DONE.
