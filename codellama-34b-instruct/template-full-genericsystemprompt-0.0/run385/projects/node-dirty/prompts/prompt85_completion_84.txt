  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of lines, while this code would split the buffer into an array of strings using the newline character as the separator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of lines, while this code would split the buffer into an array of single characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buffer.split(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the `split` method to split the buffer into an array of lines, while this code would split the buffer into an array of strings using the null character as the separator.

DONE.
