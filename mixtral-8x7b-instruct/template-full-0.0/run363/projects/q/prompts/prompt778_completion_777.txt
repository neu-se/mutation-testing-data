 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
  return promise;
}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `inspect` method is not called, and the promise object itself will be returned instead. This could cause issues if the consumer of the `allSettled` method expects an object with the `state`, `reason`, and `value` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
  return Q.resolve();
}
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function regardless() {
  return Q.reject();
}
```
This would result in different behavior because a rejected promise is always returned, even if the original promise is resolved. This could cause issues if the
