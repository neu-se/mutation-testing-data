 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` is expected to be a function, and replacing it with `null` would cause an error when it is invoked in `nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver())`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
deferred.resolve
