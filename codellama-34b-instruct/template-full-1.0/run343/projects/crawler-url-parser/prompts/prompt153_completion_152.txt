  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path == pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because `==` is used for equality comparison, while `===~` is used for identity comparison and type coercion.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.match(/(\/[^\/]*)[\/]?$/, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` is used for pattern matching, while `replace` is used for replacing substrings.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.slice(0, pageurl_path.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because `slice` is used for extracting a substring, while `replace` is used for replacing substrings.

DONE.
