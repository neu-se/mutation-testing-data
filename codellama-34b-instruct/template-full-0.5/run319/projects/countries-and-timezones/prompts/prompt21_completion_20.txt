  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` checks if a number is finite, while `Number.isInteger` checks if a number is an integer. In the context of the original code, this would cause the `dstOffset` calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` checks if a number is NaN (not a number), while `Number.isInteger` checks if a number is an integer. In the context of the original code, this would cause the `dstOffset` calculation to produce incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isSafeInteger
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isSafeInteger` checks if a number is a safe integer (an integer that can be exactly represented as a double), while `Number.isInteger` checks if a number is an
