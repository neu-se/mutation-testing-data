  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex matches words that end with "o" and are preceded by a vowel, while the new regex matches words that end with "o" and are preceded by a consonant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex is case-insensitive, while the new regex is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiouy]o$/g
```
This would result in different behavior because the original regex only replaces the first occurrence of "o" with "es", while the new regex replaces all occurrences of "o" with "es".

DONE.
