  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(rule[1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the second element in the `rule` array, rather than the type of the first element as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(w.substr(0, w.length - 1))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the substring of `w` from the first character to the last character minus one, rather than the type of `w` as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
type(w.substr(0, w.length - 2))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the type of the substring of `w` from the first character to the last character minus two, rather than the type of `w` as in the original code.

DONE.
