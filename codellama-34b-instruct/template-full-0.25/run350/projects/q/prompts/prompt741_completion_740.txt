This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.reject` method is called with the `rejection` object, which is not the same as the original code where `deferred.reject` is called with the `err` object.

```
deferred.notify({ index: index, value: progress });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `deferred.notify` method is called with an object containing the `index` and `value` properties, which is not the same as the original code where `de
