  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.call()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would result in a reference error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value.inspect.apply()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was missing the parentheses, which would result in a reference error.

DONE.
