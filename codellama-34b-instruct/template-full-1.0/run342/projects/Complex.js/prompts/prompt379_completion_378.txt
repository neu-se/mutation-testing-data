  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` computes the sine of a number, whereas `Math.cos` computes the cosine.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` expects a single argument, but `Math.sin(b)` would produce a different result because `b` is a variable that may have a different value than the original `a` variable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.sin(a + b)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.sin` computes the sine of a number, but `a + b` may produce a different result than the original `a` variable.

DONE.
