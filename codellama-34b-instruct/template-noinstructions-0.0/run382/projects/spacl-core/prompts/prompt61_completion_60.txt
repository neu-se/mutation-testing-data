  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment only matches a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a forward slash, followed by a forward slash, whereas the original code fragment only matches a forward slash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^/]+/g
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match any character except for a forward slash, followed by a forward slash, and the `g` flag would make it match all occurrences in the string, whereas the original code fragment only matches the first occurrence.

DONE.
