  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", errback);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `errback` function would be called with the wrong number of arguments, causing an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", errback, args);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be passed as an additional argument to the `errback` function, causing it to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continuer.bind(continuer, "throw", errback, args.slice(1));
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced to remove the first element, causing the `errback` function to be called with the wrong arguments, causing it to throw an error.

DONE.
