 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it always accesses the same element instead of incrementing the index after accessing the element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = i + 1; array[i]
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses an assignment operator instead of the postfix increment operator, which may lead to different behavior when dealing with side effects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the next element instead of the current one, causing the function to skip elements and eventually accessing an undefined element.

DONE.
