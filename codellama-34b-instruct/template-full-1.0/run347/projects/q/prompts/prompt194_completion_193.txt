  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the line of code to return `undefined` instead of the expected `Number`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the line of code to return `NaN` instead of the expected `Number`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the line of code to return the string "number" instead of the expected `Number`.

DONE.
