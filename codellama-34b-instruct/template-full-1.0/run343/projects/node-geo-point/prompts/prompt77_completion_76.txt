  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 bearing + 180;
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated bearing would be offset by 180 degrees, which would cause the destination point to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated bearing would always be zero, regardless of the actual bearing between the two points.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
 bearing * 2;
```
This would result in different behavior because the calculated bearing would be doubled, which would cause the destination point to be double the actual distance and angle away from the starting point.

DONE.
