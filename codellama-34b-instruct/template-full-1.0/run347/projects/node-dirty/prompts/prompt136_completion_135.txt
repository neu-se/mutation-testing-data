  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: this._data.get(key), val: undefined}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `val` would be `undefined` instead of the expected value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: this._data.get(key), val: null}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `val` would be `null` instead of the expected value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{key: this._data.get(key), val: Math.random()}
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `val` would be a random number instead of the expected value.

DONE.
