  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFileSync)
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the synchronous `writeFileSync` method instead of the asynchronous `writeFile` method. This could potentially cause issues if the function is called with a large file or if the file system is slow.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs))
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `writeFile` method of the `fs` module instead of the `universalify.fromCallback` method. This could potentially cause issues if the `fs` module is not available or if the `writeFile` method is not implemented correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
universalify.fromCallback(fs.writeFile.bind(fs, file))
```
This change will cause the `writeFile` function to use the `writeFile` method
