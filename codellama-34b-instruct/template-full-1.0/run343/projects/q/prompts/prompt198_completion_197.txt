  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!fileNameAndLineNumber[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the first element of the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array is falsy, rather than checking if the array itself is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` array has a length of zero, rather than checking if the array itself is falsy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(fileNameAndLineNumber) && fileNameAndLineNumber.length === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `fileNameAndLineNumber` variable is an array, and if it is an array, it would check if the array has a length of zero.

DONE.
