  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to accumulate the result of the reducer function, while the new code fragment `0` would always return 0 as the result, regardless of the input.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to accumulate the result of the reducer function, while the new code fragment `null` would always return null as the result, regardless of the input.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `acc` is used to accumulate the result of the reducer function, while the new code fragment `undefined` would always return undefined as the result, regardless of the input.

DONE.
