  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` refers to the `Object` prototype, while `1` is a different object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` always returns the name of the object, while `Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)` returns a random number between 0 and 9.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `obj` always returns a string, while `Number.NaN` is not a valid string and would result in an error.

DONE.
