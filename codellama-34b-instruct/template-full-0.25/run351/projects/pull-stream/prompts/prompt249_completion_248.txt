  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` signal to be a truthy value, but `null` is a falsy value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` signal to be a truthy value, but `undefined` is a falsy value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects the `abort` signal to be a truthy value, but `true` is a truthy value.

DONE.
