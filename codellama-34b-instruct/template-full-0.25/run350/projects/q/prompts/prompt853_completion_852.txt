  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearInterval
```
This would result in different behavior because `clearInterval` is a different function than `clearTimeout`, and would not clear the timeout set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
setTimeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `setTimeout` is a function that sets a timeout, rather than clearing one. It would create a new timeout, which would not have the desired effect of clearing the existing timeout.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clearTimeout(timeoutId + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would clear a different timeout than the one set by the `setTimeout` function in the original code. The `timeoutId` variable is incremented by 1, which would cause the wrong timeout to be cleared.

DONE.
