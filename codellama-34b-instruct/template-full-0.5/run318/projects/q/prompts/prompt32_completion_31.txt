  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
noop
```
This would result in different behavior because `noop` is a function that does nothing, so it would not execute the task.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function, so it would not execute the task.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Testing mutation")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would throw an error, causing the task to not be executed.

DONE.
