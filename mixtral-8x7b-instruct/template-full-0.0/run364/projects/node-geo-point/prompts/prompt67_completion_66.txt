 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `atan2` function expects two arguments, and providing a constant value instead of the `y` variable would result in incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(φ1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it directly replaces the `y` variable with a more complex expression, which would change the result of the `atan2` function and ultimately the calculated bearing.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.sin(θ) * Math.sin(δ) * Math.cos(φ1) * Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it introduces randomness to the calculation by multiplying the expression with `Math.random()`. This would lead to unpredictable results and inconsistent behavior in the `calculateBearing` method.
