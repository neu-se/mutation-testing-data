 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push(null as any);
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds `null` to the `delta.ops` array, which is not an `Op` object. The original code fragment adds an `Op` object to the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
delta.push({} as Op);
