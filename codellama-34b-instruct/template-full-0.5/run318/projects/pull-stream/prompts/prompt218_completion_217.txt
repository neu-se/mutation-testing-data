  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, cb
```
This would result in different behavior because the `err` variable is being replaced with `null`, which would cause the `map` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
err, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is being replaced with `null`, which would cause the `map` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cb` variable is being replaced with `null`, which would cause the `map` function to be called with a different set of arguments.

DONE.
