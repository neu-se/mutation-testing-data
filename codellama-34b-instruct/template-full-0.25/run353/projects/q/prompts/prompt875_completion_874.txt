  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.reject(error);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to reject the promise with the error. In contrast, the modified code fragment would immediately reject the promise with the error, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.resolve(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()` to create a callback function that is passed to `setTimeout`, which is then used to resolve the promise with the value. In contrast, the modified code fragment would immediately resolve the promise with the value, without waiting for the timeout to expire.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.notify(value);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses `deferred.makeNodeResolver()`
