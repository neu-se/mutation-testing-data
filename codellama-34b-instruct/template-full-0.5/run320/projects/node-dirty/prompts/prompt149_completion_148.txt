  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, so the loop would iterate over the elements in reverse order.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array, starting from the second element (index 1). So the loop would iterate over the elements starting from the second element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const cb of cbs.filter(cb => cb !== null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. In this case, the function checks if the element is not null, so the loop would iterate over the elements that are not null.

DONE.
