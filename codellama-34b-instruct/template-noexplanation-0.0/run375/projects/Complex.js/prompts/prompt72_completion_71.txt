  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is empty, which is the opposite of the original code fragment that checks if `tokens` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length > 0
```
This code fragment checks if the `tokens` array is not empty, which is the opposite of the original code fragment that checks if `tokens` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens.length === 1
```
This code fragment checks if the `tokens` array has only one element, which is different from the original code fragment that checks if `tokens` is null.

DONE.
