  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`null`
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a falsy value, and `mapper` is expected to be a function. If `null` is passed to `mapper`, it will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`undefined`
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a falsy value, and `mapper` is expected to be a function. If `undefined` is passed to `mapper`, it will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
`0`
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` is a truthy value, and `mapper` is expected to be a function. If `0` is passed to `mapper`, it will not throw an error, but it will produce a different result than passing `data`.

DONE.
