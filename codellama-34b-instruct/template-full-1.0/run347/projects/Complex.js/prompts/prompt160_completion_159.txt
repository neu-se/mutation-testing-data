  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` checks if the number is not a number, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isZero']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isZero` checks if the number is zero, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Complex['NAN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `Complex['NAN']` is a constant representing NaN, while `isInfinite` checks if the number is infinite.

DONE.
