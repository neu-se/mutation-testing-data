  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isFinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this new code fragment checks if the real part is finite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isNaN']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this new code fragment checks if the real part is not a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return this['isInfinite']();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the imaginary part is zero, while this new code fragment checks if the real part is infinite.

DONE.
