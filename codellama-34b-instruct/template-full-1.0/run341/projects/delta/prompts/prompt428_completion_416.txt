  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain !== 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for both equality and type, whereas the original code only checks for equality. If `op.retain` is an object, it will not be recognized as such with this new code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for both equality and type, whereas the original code only checks for equality. If `op.retain` is null, it will not be recognized as such with this new code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof op.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `typeof` operator checks for both equality and type, whereas the original code only checks for equality. If `op.retain` is a function, it will not be recognized as such with this new code.

DONE
