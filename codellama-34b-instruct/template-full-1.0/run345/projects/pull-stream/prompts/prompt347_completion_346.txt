  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not the same as `data`, and the function would return a different value if `key` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not the same as `data`, and the function would return a different value if `key` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Object()
```
This would result in different behavior because `new Object()` is not the same as `data`, and the function would return a different value if `key` is an object.

DONE.
