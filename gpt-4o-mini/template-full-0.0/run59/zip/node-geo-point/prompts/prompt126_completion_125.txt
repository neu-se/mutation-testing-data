Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return a GeoPoint at the coordinates (0, 0) instead of the current instance's latitude and longitude.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude + this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a single number that is the sum of the latitude and longitude, rather than a GeoPoint object representing the current coordinates.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.latitude * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a GeoPoint with the latitude doubled, which does not accurately represent the original point's location.

DONE.
