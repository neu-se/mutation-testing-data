  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to attempt to parse the next token as a float, which could result in an error if the next token is not a valid number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use the next token as the imaginary part of the complex number, rather than attempting to parse it as a float.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i + 1] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to use twice the value of the next token as the imaginary part of the complex number.

DONE.
