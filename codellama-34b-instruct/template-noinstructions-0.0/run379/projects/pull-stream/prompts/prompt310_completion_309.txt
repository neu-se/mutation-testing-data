  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!test
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the result of the `test` function, causing the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `false` regardless of the value of `test`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test || true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would cause the `if` statement to always evaluate to `true` regardless of the value of `test`.

DONE.
