  Mutation testing involves introducing changes or "mutations" into the code to see if the tests can detect the changes. The goal is to identify areas of the code that are not adequately tested.

Here are three options for replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different behavior than the original code fragment:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read()
```
This would result in infinite recursion because `read` is called repeatedly without passing any arguments, so the while loop will never exit.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op(data)
```
This would result in a different execution path because `op` is a function that takes `data` as an argument, but it is not called in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
read(true, done)
```
This would result in a different execution path because `read` is called with `true` and `done` as arguments, instead of `null` and `done` as
