Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always increase the number of decimal places to which the complex number is rounded, potentially leading to less precision than intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would double the number of decimal places, which could lead to unexpected rounding results, especially for values that are already close to a rounding boundary.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
places && 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would evaluate `places` in a way that could lead to `0` being used regardless of the intended number of places, effectively flooring the complex number to an integer value without any decimal precision.

DONE.
