  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOpData
```
This would result in different behavior because `opData` and `baseOpData` are both objects, but they are not the same object. Modifying `opData` would not modify `baseOpData`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisOp.retain` is a number, whereas `opData` and `baseOpData` are objects.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
const otherOp = new Op(otherIter.next());
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherOp` is a new object that represents the next operation in the other iterator's sequence.

DONE.
