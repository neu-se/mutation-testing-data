  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && !op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the operation of the original code fragment, causing the `invert` method to retain the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && op.attributes.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply the `invert` method to operations with at least one attribute, which could cause certain operations to be retained that should not be.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.retain && typeof op.attributes === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only apply the `invert` method to operations without attributes, which could cause certain operations to be retained that should not be.

DONE.
