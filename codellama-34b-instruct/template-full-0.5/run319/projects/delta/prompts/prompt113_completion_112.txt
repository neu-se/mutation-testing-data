  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((accum, curr) => accum + curr.retain, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all `retain` properties in the `ops` array, instead of the expected `reduce` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((accum, curr) => accum + curr.insert, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all `insert` properties in the `ops` array, instead of the expected `reduce` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.reduce((accum, curr) => accum + curr.delete, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the sum of all `delete` properties in the `ops` array, instead of the expected `reduce` method.

DONE.
