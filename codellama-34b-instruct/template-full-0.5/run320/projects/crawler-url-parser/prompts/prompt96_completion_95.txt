  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr + "dummy"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is concatenated with the string "dummy", which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.replace("http", "https")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is replaced with a modified version of itself, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
href, baseUrlStr.split("/")[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `baseUrlStr` variable is split on the "/" character and only the first element is used, which would cause the `parse` function to return a different URL object.

DONE.
