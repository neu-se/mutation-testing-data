Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.match
```
This would result in different behavior because `match` returns an array containing the matched strings if the string matches the regular expression, or `null` if it does not, whereas `split` splits the string into an array of substrings based on the regular expression.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.replace
```
This would result in different behavior because `replace` returns a new string with the replacement made, rather than an array of substrings, which would cause the subsequent code to fail when trying to access elements of the result as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value.search
```
This would result in different behavior because `search` returns the index of the first match of the regular expression in the string, or -1 if no match is found, which is a single number rather than an array of substrings, and would cause the subsequent code to fail when trying to access elements of the result as an array.

DONE.
