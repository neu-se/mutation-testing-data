  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cosh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cosh` function has a different output than the `sinh` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tanh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `tanh` function has a different output than the `sinh` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
asinh
```
This would result in different behavior because the `asinh` function has a different output than the `sinh` function.

DONE.
