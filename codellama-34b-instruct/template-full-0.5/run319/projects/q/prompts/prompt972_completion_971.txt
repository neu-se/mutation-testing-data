  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be reversed before being passed to the `name` method, which could potentially cause unexpected results if the method relies on the order of the arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be sliced from the second element onwards, which could potentially cause unexpected results if the method relies on the first element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name, args.concat([1, 2, 3])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `args` array would be concatenated with the `[1, 2, 3]` array, which could potentially cause unexpected results if the method relies on the length or content of the `args` array.

DONE.
