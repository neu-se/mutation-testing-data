  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
await
```
This would result in different behavior because `await` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and using it as a standalone statement would cause a syntax error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
continue
```
This would result in different behavior because `continue` is also a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and using it as a standalone statement would cause a syntax error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error('Placeholder')
```
This would result in different behavior because `throw` would cause an error to be thrown, which would interrupt the control flow of the program, whereas the original code fragment does not throw an error.

DONE.
