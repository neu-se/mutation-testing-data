  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1, 1, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only run the same code when the first two arguments are both truthy. In the original code fragment, it would run the code regardless of the first two arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressed, progressed, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `progressed` variable as the callback for all three hooks, instead of passing a different callback for each hook as in the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, null, progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because it would force the callback to `progressed` for all three hooks, and not allow for any conditional execution as in the original code fragment.

DONE.
