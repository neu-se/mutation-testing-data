  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.slice
```
This would result in different behavior because `substr` and `slice` are different methods of the `String` object, and they have different parameters and behavior. `substr` takes two parameters, `start` and `stop`, and returns the characters from the start position to the stop position. `slice` takes two parameters, `begin` and `end`, and returns the characters from the start position to the end position.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the original string. The `substr` method without the negative second argument would return the entire string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.substr(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different substring of the original string. The `substr` method with a positive second argument would return the substring starting from the second character.

DONE.
