Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl_path.startsWith(linkurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because `startsWith` checks if `pageurl_path` begins with `linkurl_path`, which is a stricter condition than checking if `linkurl_path` is anywhere within `pageurl_path`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.includes(pageurl_path)
```
This would result in different behavior because it reverses the logic, checking if `linkurl_path` contains `pageurl_path`, which is not the same as checking if `pageurl_path` contains `linkurl_path`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path === pageurl_path
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for exact equality between `linkurl_path` and `pageurl_path`, rather than checking for a substring relationship, which could lead to different outcomes in the logic flow.

DONE.
