  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.reverse()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reverse()` method reverses the order of the elements in the array, which could potentially change the outcome of the `query()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.slice(0, -1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice()` method returns a new array with the same elements as the original array, but with the last element removed. This could potentially change the outcome of the `query()` method if the last rule is important for the policy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...rules.splice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `splice()` method removes the first element of the array and returns it as a new array. This could potentially change the outcome of the `query()` method if the first rule is important for the policy.

DONE.
