 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `a` object's keys instead of the `b` object's keys in the `reduce` function, potentially filtering out keys that should have been included in the result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(<PLACEHOLDER>).length
