  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with a `null` value, which would likely throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with an `undefined` value, which would likely cause the function to return `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
''
```
This would result in different behavior because the `test` function would be called with an empty string value, which would likely cause the function to return `true`.

DONE.
