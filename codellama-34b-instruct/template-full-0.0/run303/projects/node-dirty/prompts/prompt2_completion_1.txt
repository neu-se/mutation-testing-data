  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `val` in the `_data` map, but it would not update the `_queue` map, which is used to keep track of the order in which the data was written to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._queue.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `val` in the `_queue` map, but it would not update the `_data` map, which is used to store the actual data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._data.set(key, val);
this._queue.set(key, val);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of `key` to `val` in both the `_data` and `_queue` maps, which would cause the data
