This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of arguments passed to the `apply` method, which could cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of arguments passed to the `apply` method, which could cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the number of arguments passed to the `apply` method, which could cause the method to fail or produce unexpected results.

DONE.
