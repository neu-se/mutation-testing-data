  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.promiseDispatch
```
This would result in different behavior because `promiseDispatch` is a different method than `dispatch`, and it may have different behavior or functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `bind` creates a new function that is bound to a specific context, which may affect the behavior of `dispatch`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` invokes a function immediately, which may affect the behavior of `dispatch`.

DONE.
