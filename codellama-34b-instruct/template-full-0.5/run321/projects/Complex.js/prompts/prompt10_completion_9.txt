  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*x
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, whereas `x*x` would simply square the value of `x`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x/Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, whereas `x/Math.PI` would divide `x` by the mathematical constant pi.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x*Math.PI
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `Math.exp` function, which returns the exponential value of a number, whereas `x*Math.PI` would multiply `x` by the mathematical constant pi.

DONE.
