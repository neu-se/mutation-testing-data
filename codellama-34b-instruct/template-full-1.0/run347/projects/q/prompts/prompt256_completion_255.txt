  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolvedPromise === promise
```
This would result in different behavior because `resolvedPromise` is a promise that may or may not be resolved, while `promise` is a promise that is guaranteed to be resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `progressListeners` is an array of functions that are called when the promise makes progress, while `resolvedPromise` is a resolved promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.isPending()
```
This would result in different behavior because `isPending()` returns `true` if the promise is still pending, while `resolvedPromise` is a resolved promise.

DONE.
