  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Q.defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which creates a new deferred object with the provided value as the resolved value. By replacing it with `Q.defer(null)`, the resolved value will be `null` instead of the original value, which may cause the `put` method to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.defer(undefined);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `Q.defer(<PLACEHOLDER>)`, which creates a new deferred object with the provided value as the resolved value. By replacing it with `Q.defer(undefined)`, the resolved value will be `undefined` instead of the original value, which may cause the `put` method to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var next = Q.
