  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
buildCountry(data, id)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return the wrong country object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return `null` instead of a country object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `getCountry` function to return `undefined` instead of a country object.

DONE.
