  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
x
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `x` instead of `y`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of `hypot`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `z` instead of `y`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of `hypot`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1000
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the value of `1000` instead of `y`, which could lead to a different result in the calculation of `hypot`.

DONE.
