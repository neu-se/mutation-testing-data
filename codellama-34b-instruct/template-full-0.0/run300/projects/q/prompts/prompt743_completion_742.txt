  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onRejected, onFulfilled)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected).then(onFulfilled, onRejected)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved twice and then rejected twice, which could lead to unexpected results.

DONE.
