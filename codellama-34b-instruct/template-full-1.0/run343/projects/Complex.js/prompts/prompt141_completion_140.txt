  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isFinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` returns `true` for any finite number, while `isInfinite` returns `true` only for positive and negative infinity.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNaN']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNaN` returns `true` for any value that is not a number, while `isInfinite` returns `true` only for positive and negative infinity.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isNegative']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isNegative` returns `true` only for negative numbers, while `isInfinite` returns `true` for both positive and negative infinity.

DONE.
