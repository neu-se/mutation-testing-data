 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` variable would be set to `null` instead of the resolved value of the promise. This could cause issues downstream if other parts of the codebase are not equipped to handle `null` values.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` variable would be set to `true` instead of the resolved value of the promise. This could cause issues downstream if other parts of the codebase are not equipped to handle boolean values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
messages
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nearerValue` variable would be set to the `messages` array instead of the resolved value of the promise. This could cause issues downstream if other parts of the codebase are not equipped to handle arrays.

DONE.
