 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(new Error("Initial rejection"))
```
This would result in different behavior because the queue would be rejected immediately upon creation, making it unusable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method would not be able to add any values to the queue, as the `ends` promise would be immediately resolved with an empty object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer().promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the `put` method would not be able to add any values to the queue, as the `ends` promise would be immediately resolved with an empty object.

DONE.
