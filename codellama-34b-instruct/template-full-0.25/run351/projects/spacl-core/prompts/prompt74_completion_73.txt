  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res === true
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is `false`, while this new code fragment checks if the result is `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
res !== false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is `false`, while this new code fragment checks if the result is not `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!res
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the result is `false`, while this new code fragment checks if the result is not `true`.

DONE.
