  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the state is "rejected", while this replacement checks if the state is "fulfilled".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state !== "pending"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the state is "rejected", while this replacement checks if the state is not "pending".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
inspected.state === "fulfilled" || inspected.state === "rejected"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the state is "rejected", while this replacement checks if the state is "fulfilled" or "rejected".

DONE.
