 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
b === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat empty objects and null values differently than the original code. The original code checks if `b` is not an object, while this modification checks if `b` is exactly null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof b !== 'object' && b !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would explicitly check for null values, which the original code does not. This might cause the function to behave differently if `b` is null.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
typeof b !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would treat strings as objects, while the original code does not. This might cause the function to behave differently if `b` is a string.

By introducing these changes, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in catching unexpected behavior due to changes in the comparison of `b` with other
