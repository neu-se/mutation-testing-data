  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[1], strings[0], cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the second string to the first string, rather than the first string to the second string, which could result in different differences being detected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0], strings[1], cursor + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to start comparing the strings at the second character, rather than the first character, which could result in different differences being detected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
strings[0].slice(1), strings[1].slice(1), cursor
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the diff function to compare the second string to the first string, starting from the second character, rather than the first character, which could result in different differences being detected.

DONE.
