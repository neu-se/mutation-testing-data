  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length > opLength - offset
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a greater than or equal to operator, while the new code fragment uses a greater than operator. This means that the new code fragment will return a different result when the length is equal to the operation length minus the offset.

DONE.
