  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.name
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.name` property is a string, while the original code fragment `policy` is a `Policy` object. This could cause issues if the `Policy` class has a `name` property that is not a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.query(path, verb, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.query` method is called with the same arguments as the original code fragment, but with a different context. This could cause issues if the `Policy` class has a `query` method that is not idempotent.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
policy.matches(path, ctx)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `policy.matches` method is called with the same arguments as the original code fragment, but with a different context. This could cause issues if the `Policy` class has a `matches` method that is
