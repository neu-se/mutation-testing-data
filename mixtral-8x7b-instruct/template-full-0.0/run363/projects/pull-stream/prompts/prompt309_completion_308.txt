 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) === true
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the data passes the test instead of failing it, potentially causing the function to continue iterating when it should have stopped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
test(data) !== false
