  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `StopIteration` exception is caught and a rejected promise is returned with the `exception.value` as the reason. In this modified code, the `StopIteration` exception is not caught, and the `exception.value` is passed to `Q.reject` as the reason for the rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(exception.value)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, the `StopIteration` exception is caught and a resolved promise is returned with the `exception.value` as the value. In this modified code, the `StopIteration` exception is not caught, and the `exception.value` is passed to `Q.resolve` as the value for the resolution.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.throw(exception.value)
```
This would result
