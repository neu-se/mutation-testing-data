  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.values()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the values of the `urlMap` object, rather than the keys as in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap.keys()) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the keys of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values as in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (let currentUrl of urlMap) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...of` loop would iterate over the entries of the `urlMap` object, rather than the values as in the original code.

DONE.
