  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { throw new Error("Intentional error"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with an error, whereas the original code would resolve the promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.reject("Intentional rejection"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be rejected with a rejection reason, whereas the original code would resolve the promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.then(function() { return Q.defer().promise; });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the promise to be resolved with a new, unrelated promise, whereas the original code would resolve the promise with the original value.

DONE.
