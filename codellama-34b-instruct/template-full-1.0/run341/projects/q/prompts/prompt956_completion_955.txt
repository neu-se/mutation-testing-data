  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeNodeResolver` expects an array, not null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[42]
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeNodeResolver` expects an array containing the same number of elements as the `nodeArgs` array, not a fixed array like `[42]`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because the function `makeNodeResolver` expects the parameters to be in a specific order, not with null inserted as an extra parameter.

DONE.
