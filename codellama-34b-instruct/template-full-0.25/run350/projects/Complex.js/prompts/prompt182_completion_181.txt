  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the new code checks if `z` is equal to 0.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the new code checks if `z` is equal to 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['isZero'](NaN)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if `z` is zero, while the new code checks if `z` is equal to `NaN`.

DONE.
