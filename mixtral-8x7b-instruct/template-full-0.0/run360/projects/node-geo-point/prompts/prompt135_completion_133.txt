 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, while `toFixed` rounds to a specified number of decimal places.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
input.toString
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString` converts the number to a string, while `toFixed` converts the number to a string after rounding it to a specified number of decimal places.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer, while `toFixed` rounds to a specified number of decimal places.

DONE.
