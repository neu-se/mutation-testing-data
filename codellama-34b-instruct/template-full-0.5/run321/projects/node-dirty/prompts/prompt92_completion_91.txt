  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('Empty lines never appear in a healthy database')
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different, and the code would still throw an error.

DONE.
