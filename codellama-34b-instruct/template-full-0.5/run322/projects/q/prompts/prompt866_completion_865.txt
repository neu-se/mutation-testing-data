  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(1)` is a function call with a single argument, whereas `defer` is a function call with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(null)` is a function call with a single argument, whereas `defer` is a function call with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
defer(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because `defer(undefined)` is a function call with a single argument, whereas `defer` is a function call with no arguments.

DONE.
