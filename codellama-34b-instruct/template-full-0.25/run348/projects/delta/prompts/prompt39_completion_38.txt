  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invert the logic of the original code fragment, causing the `transform` function to return `b` when `a[key]` is defined, rather than when it is undefined.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] == undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use a loose equality comparison instead of a strict equality comparison, which could cause the `transform` function to return `b` when `a[key]` is `null` or `undefined`, rather than when it is strictly equal to `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a[key] === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `a[key]` is `null` instead of `undefined`, which could cause the `transform` function to return `b` when `a[key]` is `null`, rather than when it is `undefined`.
