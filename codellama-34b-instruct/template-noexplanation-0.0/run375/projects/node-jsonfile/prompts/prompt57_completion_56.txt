  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r/g
```
This will cause the `replace` method to only match carriage return characters (`\r`), rather than newline characters (`\n`). This may cause the `stringify` function to produce different output than expected, and could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\r\n/g
```
This will cause the `replace` method to match both carriage return and newline characters (`\r\n`), rather than just newline characters. This may also cause the `stringify` function to produce different output than expected, and could potentially reveal a bug in the test suite.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[\r\n]+/g
```
This will cause the `replace` method to match one or more carriage return or newline characters (`\r\n`), rather than just newline characters. This may also cause the `stringify` function to produce different output than expected, and could potentially reveal a bug in the
