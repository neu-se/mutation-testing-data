  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.replace('localhost', '127.0.0.1')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^localhost\:\/\/` in the `if` statement would not match the new value of `pageurl`, which contains the string `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`. Therefore, the variable `currentUrlStr` would not be set to `pageurl.replace(/^(?!http:\/\/)/,\'http://\')`, and the `else` block would execute instead.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
pageurl.replace('http://', 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^http:\/\//` in the `if` statement would not match the new value of `pageurl`, which contains the string `https://` instead of `http://`. Therefore, the variable `currentUrlStr` would not be set to `pageurl.replace(/^(?!http:\/\/)/
