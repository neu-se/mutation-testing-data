  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the attributes of the current operation, rather than the attributes of both operations, to the `invert` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the attributes of the base operation, rather than the attributes of both operations, to the `invert` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a null value to the `invert` method, which would likely cause an error.

DONE.
