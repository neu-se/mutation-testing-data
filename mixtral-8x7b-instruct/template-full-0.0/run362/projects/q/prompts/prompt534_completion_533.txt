 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `spread` function is now a regular function instead of the `rejected` variable, which could cause the `spread` function to behave differently depending on how it utilizes this argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `spread` function is now `null`, which might cause issues if the `spread` function assumes the second argument to be a function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of `spread` function is now `this`, which might cause issues if the `spread` function assumes the second argument to be a function. Additionally, the behavior might change depending on the context where the `spread` function is called.

DONE.
