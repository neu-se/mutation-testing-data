  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...cos(2*Δλ)...
```
This would result in different behavior because the cosine function has a different range and output for inputs outside of the interval (-π,π].

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...sin(2*Δλ)...
```
This would result in different behavior because the sine function has a different range and output for inputs outside of the interval (-π,π].

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
...tan(2*Δλ)...
```
This would result in different behavior because the tangent function has a different range and output for inputs outside of the interval (-π/2,π/2].

DONE.
