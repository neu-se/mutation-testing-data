  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezonesMap` would not be evaluated as a truthy value, even if it is defined and has a value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezonesMap.size > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because `timezonesMap.size` would not be evaluated as a truthy value, even if `timezonesMap` has elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Array.isArray(timezonesMap)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Array.isArray` would return `false` even if `timezonesMap` is an array.

DONE.
