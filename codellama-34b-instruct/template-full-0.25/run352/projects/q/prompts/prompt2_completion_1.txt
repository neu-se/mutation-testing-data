  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"console.log"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the replaced code fragment is a string literal.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the replaced code fragment is a string literal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"null"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is a function call, while the replaced code fragment is a string literal.

DONE.
