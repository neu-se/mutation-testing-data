  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but `null` is being passed instead. This would cause the function to throw an error, which would be caught by the promise's error handler and result in a rejected promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function() {})
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but an empty function is being passed instead. This would cause the function to return a resolved promise with a value of `undefined`, which would not match the behavior of the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred.makeNodeResolver(function(err) { throw err; })
```
This would result in different behavior because the `makeNodeResolver` function expects a function as its argument, but a function that throws an error is being
