  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isInfinite']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isInfinite` is always `false` for a zero complex number, while `isZero` is `true` for a zero complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['isReal']
```
This would result in different behavior because `isReal` is always `true` for a complex number with non-zero imaginary part, while `isZero` is `false` for such a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['im'] === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the imaginary part is zero, while `isZero` checks if the real part is zero.

DONE.
