  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the transformed index would be one less than the original index. This could cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a different value than it would if the original code was used, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the transformed index would be one greater than the original index. This could cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a different value than it would if the original code was used, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
opLength * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the transformed index would be twice the original index. This could cause the `otherIter.next()` method to return a different value than it would if the original code was used, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

DONE.
