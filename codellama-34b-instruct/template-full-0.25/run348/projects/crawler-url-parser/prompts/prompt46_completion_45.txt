  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse` returns an object with the parsed URL components, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve` resolves a relative URL against a base URL, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl))
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse(URL.resolve(parsedBaseUrl, parsedUrl))` would return an object with the parsed URL components of the resolved URL, while `URL.format` returns a formatted URL string.

DONE.
