  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, value * 2]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `key` property would be increased by a factor of 2, whereas the original code sets it to `value`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, "new value"]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `key` property would be set to the string "new value", whereas the original code sets it to `value`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"set", [key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `key` property would be set to `undefined`, whereas the original code sets it to `value`.

DONE.
