  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer` is a function that checks if a value is a buffer, while `Buffer.isBuffer.toString()` is a string representation of the function, which would always return `true` when used as a condition.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer.call(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer.call(null)` would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `content`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Buffer.isBuffer.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `Buffer.isBuffer.apply(null)` would always return `false`, regardless of the value of `content`.

DONE.
