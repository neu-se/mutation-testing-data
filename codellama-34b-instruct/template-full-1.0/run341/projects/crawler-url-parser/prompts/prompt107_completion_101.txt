  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if the URL is in the map, and a null value would be evaluated as false in a conditional statement.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment compares the URLs as strings, and an empty string would be different from any non-empty string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses a specific URL string, while using Math.random() would generate a random URL each time the code is executed.

DONE.
