 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bactrium', 'bacteria'
```
This would result in different behavior because the first string no longer matches the original pattern, and the test for that pattern would not be exercised.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacterium', 'bacterias'
```
This would result in different behavior because the second string is now incorrect, and the test for the 'bacterium' to 'bacteria' conversion would not be exercised.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'bacterium', function(w) { return w + 'a' }
