 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
Math.round
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds the input to the nearest integer instead of using a specified number of decimal places. This could lead to loss of precision and incorrect results when adjusting the geopoint's precision.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(input: any) => input.toFixed(precision)
```
This would result in different behavior because the arrow function does not explicitly convert the input to a number before calling `toFixed`. This could lead to unexpected behavior when the input is a string or another non-number type.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
(input: number) => parseFloat(input.toPrecision(precision))
```
This would result in different behavior because `toPrecision` returns a string with a specified number of significant digits, not decimal places. This could lead to incorrect results when adjusting the geop
