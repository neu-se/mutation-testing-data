  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.slice(0, -1)}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the slice method is used to remove the last character of the buffer, which would cause the error message to be different from the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.toUpperCase()}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the toUpperCase method is used to convert the buffer to uppercase, which would cause the error message to be different from the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer.split('').reverse().join('')}`)
```
This would result in different behavior because the split, reverse, and join methods are used to reverse the order of the characters in the buffer, which would cause the error message to be different from the original
