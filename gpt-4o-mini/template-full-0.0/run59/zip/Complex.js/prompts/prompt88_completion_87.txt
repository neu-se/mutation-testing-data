Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
tokens[i - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it refers to the previous token instead of the next one, potentially leading to incorrect parsing of the imaginary part of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1] + '0')
```
This would result in different behavior because it appends a '0' to the next token, which could change its value (e.g., turning '2' into '20'), leading to incorrect calculations of the imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parseFloat(tokens[i + 1]) + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds 1 to the parsed value of the next token, which would incorrectly increase the imaginary part by 1, altering the intended value.

DONE.
