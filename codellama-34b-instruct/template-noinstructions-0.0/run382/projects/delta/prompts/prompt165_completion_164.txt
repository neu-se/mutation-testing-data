  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over the `other` delta's operations instead of the `this` delta's operations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over the lengths of the `this` delta's operations instead of the operations themselves.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `diffResult.forEach` loop to iterate over the lengths of the `other` delta's operations instead of the operations themselves.

DONE.
