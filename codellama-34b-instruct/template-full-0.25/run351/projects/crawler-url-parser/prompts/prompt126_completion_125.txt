  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass the `baseUrlStr` argument to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to use the `baseUrlStr` as the base URL for parsing the URL, rather than using the default base URL.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass `null` as the base URL for parsing the URL, which would cause the function to use the default base URL.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
parse(url, baseUrlStr.replace(/^\/\//, 'http://'))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass a modified version of the `baseUrlStr` argument to the `parse` function, which would cause the function to use a different base URL for parsing the URL.

DONE.
