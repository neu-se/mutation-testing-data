  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
""
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `embedBaseUrl` variable undefined, which would cause the `baseUrl` variable to be assigned the value of `URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)` instead of `URL.parse(embedBaseUrlStr, true, true)`.  

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `embedBaseUrl` variable a number, which would cause an error when the `URL.format()` method is called on it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would make the `embedBaseUrl` variable undefined, which would cause the `baseUrl` variable to be assigned the value of `URL.parse(currentUrlStr, true, true)` instead of `URL.parse(embedBaseUrlStr, true, true)`. 

* DONE.
