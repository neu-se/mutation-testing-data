  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next operation if it is not a delete operation, which would cause the loop to skip over any delete operations in the iterator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() || iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would consider the next operation even if it is a delete operation, which would cause the loop to include delete operations in the iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
iter.hasNext() && iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only consider the next operation if it is an insert operation, which would cause the loop to skip over any non-insert operations in the iterator.

DONE.
