  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `src` argument is not a glob, and `false` when it is a glob.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.call(null, src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `call` method is used to call the `isGlob` function with a different `this` value, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob.apply(null, [src])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is used to call the `isGlob` function with a different `this` value and a different set of arguments, which could potentially cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
