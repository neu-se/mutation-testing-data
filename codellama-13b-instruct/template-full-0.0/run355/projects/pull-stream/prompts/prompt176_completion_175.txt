  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire array, while this code fragment returns only the first element of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array[array.length - 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire array, while this code fragment returns only the last element of the array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array.slice(0, 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire array, while this code fragment returns a new array containing only the first element of the original array.

DONE.
