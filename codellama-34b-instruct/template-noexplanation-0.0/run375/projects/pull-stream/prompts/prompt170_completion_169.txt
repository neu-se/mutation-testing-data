  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This change will cause the function to always return `false` instead of the expected value from the `array`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i++])
```
This change will cause the function to return the same value for each iteration, instead of the expected value from the `array`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, array[i--])
```
This change will cause the function to return the same value for each iteration, but in reverse order, instead of the expected value from the `array`.

DONE.
