  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `object` is `null`, whereas the original code just checks if `object` is a promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `object` is a string, whereas the original code just checks if `object` is a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object === Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `object` is a promise that has already been resolved, whereas the original code just checks if `object` is a promise.

DONE.
