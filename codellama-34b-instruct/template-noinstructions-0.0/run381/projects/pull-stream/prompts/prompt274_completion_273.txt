  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only emits a single value, whereas `null` is a null value that does not have a `read` method and would cause an error if called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only emits a single value, whereas `undefined` is a value that does not have a `read` method and would cause an error if called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function() {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `once` is a function that returns a new stream that only emits a single value, whereas the new function would return a new stream that emits no values.

DONE.
