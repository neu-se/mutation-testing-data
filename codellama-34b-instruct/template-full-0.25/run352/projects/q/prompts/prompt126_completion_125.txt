  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for `null`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for `object`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for `undefined`, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for `object`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `object_hasOwnProperty` function would return `false` for an empty object, whereas the original code fragment would return `true` for `object`.

DONE.
