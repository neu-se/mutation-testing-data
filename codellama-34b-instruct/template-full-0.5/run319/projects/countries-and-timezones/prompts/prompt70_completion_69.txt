  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(null);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function with a `null` argument, which would likely cause an error or unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name]);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function with a different argument than the original code, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
memoizeTimezone(timezones[name], { deprecated: true });
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `memoizeTimezone` function with a different set of arguments than the original code, which would likely cause the function to behave differently.

DONE.
