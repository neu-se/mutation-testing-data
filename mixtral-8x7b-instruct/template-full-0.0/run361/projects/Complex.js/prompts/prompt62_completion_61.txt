 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `1` is a constant, whereas `a['phi']` is a property access on the object `a`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 and 1, whereas `a['phi']` is a property access on the object `a`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b
```
This would result in different behavior because `b` is a different variable than `a`, whereas `a['phi']` is a property access on the object `a`.

DONE.
