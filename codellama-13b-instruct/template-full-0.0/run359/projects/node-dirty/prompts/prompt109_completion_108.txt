  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a new Error object, which would cause the program to crash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit('error', new Error(`Corrupted row at the end of the db: ${buffer}`));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would emit an error event with a new Error object, which would cause the program to crash.
