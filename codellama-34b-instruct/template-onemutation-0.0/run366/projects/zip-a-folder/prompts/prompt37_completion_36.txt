  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the result of the `isGlob` function, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `src` is not a glob, and `false` when it is a glob. This would cause the `zipArchive.glob(globPart)` method to be called when it should not be, and vice versa.

DONE.
