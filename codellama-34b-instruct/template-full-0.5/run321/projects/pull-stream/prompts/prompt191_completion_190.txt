  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!prop
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would invert the truthiness of the `prop` variable, potentially causing the `map` function to receive a different value than expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would add 1 to the value of `prop`, potentially causing the `map` function to receive a different value than expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
prop.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the value of `prop` to uppercase, potentially causing the `map` function to receive a different value than expected.

DONE.
