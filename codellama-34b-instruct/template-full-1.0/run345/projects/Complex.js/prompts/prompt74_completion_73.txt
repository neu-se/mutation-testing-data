  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '' : '-') + c);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `minus % 2 ? '-' : ''` condition would always evaluate to an empty string, effectively removing the negation operator.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + c);
```
This would result in different behavior because the  `minus % 2 ? '-' : ''` condition would always evaluate to a negation operator, effectively adding the negation operator to the imaginary part instead of the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['re'] += parseFloat((minus % 2 ? '-' : '') + (tokens[i + 1] === 'i' ? '1' : c));
```
This would result in different behavior because the  `tokens[i + 1] === 'i'`
