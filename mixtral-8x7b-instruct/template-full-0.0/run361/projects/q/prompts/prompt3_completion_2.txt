 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the bootstrap function would receive a `null` value instead of an object, causing the CommonJS, RequireJS, and SES paths to not initialize Q properly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the bootstrap function would receive a number value instead of an object, causing the CommonJS, RequireJS, and SES paths to not initialize Q properly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the bootstrap function would receive an empty object instead of a function, causing the CommonJS, RequireJS, and SES paths to not initialize Q properly.

These changes would expose potential issues in the test suite by causing the tests to not initialize Q correctly, which would likely cause the tests to fail or produce incorrect results. DONE.
