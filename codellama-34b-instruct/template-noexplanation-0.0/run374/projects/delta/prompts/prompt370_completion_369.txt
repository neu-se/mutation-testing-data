  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This will cause the `transform` method to delete the current operation instead of retaining it, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, {})
```
This will cause the `transform` method to retain the current operation with an empty attribute map, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(length, { foo: 'bar' })
```
This will cause the `transform` method to retain the current operation with an attribute map containing a single attribute `foo` with value `bar`, which will result in a different behavior than the original code.

DONE.
