  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null;
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `fallback` is a function that is called with the `promise` object as its context, but in this version, `fallback` is not called and the `promise` object is not used.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `fallback` is called with the `promise` object as its context, but in this version, `promise` is not called and the `promise` object is not used.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.makePromise();
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `fallback` is called with the `promise` object as its context, but in this version, `Q.makePromise` is called with no arguments and no context.

DONE.
