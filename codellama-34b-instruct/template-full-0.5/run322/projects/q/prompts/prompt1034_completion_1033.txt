  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number used in the stack trace would be off by one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number used in the stack trace would be double the actual line number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
captureLine - 10
```
This would result in different behavior because the line number used in the stack trace would be 10 less than the actual line number.

DONE.
