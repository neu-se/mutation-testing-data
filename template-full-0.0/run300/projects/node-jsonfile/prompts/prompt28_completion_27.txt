  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!shouldThrow
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator negates the value of `shouldThrow`, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the negated value would be `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`, and the error would not be thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow === false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`, the expression would evaluate to `false`, and vice versa. This would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `false` when it should be `true`, and the error would not be thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
shouldThrow !== true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so if `shouldThrow` is `true`,
