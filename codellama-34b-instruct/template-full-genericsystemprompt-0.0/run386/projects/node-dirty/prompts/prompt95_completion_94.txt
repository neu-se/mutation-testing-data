  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing a JSON string, while the new code fragment is converting the string to uppercase before parsing it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.split('')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing a JSON string, while the new code fragment is splitting the string into an array of characters before parsing it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rowStr.replace('key', 'value')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is parsing a JSON string, while the new code fragment is replacing the string 'key' with 'value' before parsing it.

DONE.
