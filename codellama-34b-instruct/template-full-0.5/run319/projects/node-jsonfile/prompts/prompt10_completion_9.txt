  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver || null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `options.reviver` as the second argument to `JSON.parse`, while the new code uses `null` as the second argument. This could cause the JSON parsing to behave differently, especially if the reviver function is important for the correct parsing of the JSON data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options.reviver && null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses `options.reviver` as the second argument to `JSON.parse`, while the new code uses `null` as the second argument only if `options.reviver` is truthy. This could cause the JSON parsing to behave differently, especially if the reviver function is important for the correct parsing of the JSON data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse(data, options
