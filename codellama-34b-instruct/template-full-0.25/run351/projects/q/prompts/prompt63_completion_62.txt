  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and does not have a `flush` method, so the `requestTick` function would throw an error when trying to call `flush` on `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and does not have a `flush` method, so the `requestTick` function would throw an error when trying to call `flush` on `undefined`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because `{}` is an object and does not have a `flush` method, so the `requestTick` function would throw an error when trying to call `flush` on `{}`.

DONE.
