  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `null` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. The `cb` function is expected to be called with an error object as the first argument if there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with `undefined` as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. The `cb` function is expected to be called with an error object as the first argument if there is an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error('some error message')
```
This change will cause the `cb` function to be called with a new error object as the first argument, which is not the expected behavior. The `cb` function is expected to be called with an error object as the first argument if there is an error.

DONE.
