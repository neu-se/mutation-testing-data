  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part === pageurl_without_last_part
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use strict equality comparison instead of loose equality comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.includes(pageurl_without_last_part)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the `pageurl_without_last_part` is a substring of `linkurl_without_last_part` instead of checking if they are equal.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_without_last_part.indexOf(pageurl_without_last_part) === 0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if `pageurl_without_last_part` is the first substring of `linkurl_without_last_part` instead of checking if they are equal.

DONE.
