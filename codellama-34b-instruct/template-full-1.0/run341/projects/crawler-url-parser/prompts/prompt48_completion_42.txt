  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(absoluteUrl, true, parseQueryStringOptions)
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, `parseQueryStringOptions`, is an object that specifies options for parsing the query string. By passing in a different object, the behavior of the `URL.parse` method could be affected, leading to different results when compared to the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(absoluteUrl, true, { parseQueryString: false })
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, `parseQueryStringOptions`, is an object that specifies options for parsing the query string. By passing in a different object, the behavior of the `URL.parse` method could be affected, leading to different results when compared to the original code. In this case, the query string would not be parsed, leading to different results when the code is executed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse(absoluteUrl, true,
