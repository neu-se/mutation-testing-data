  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `+` operator to add the value of `c` to the value of `a`, while the modified code fragment uses the `+=` operator to add the value of `c` to the value of `a` and assign the result back to `a`. The `+=` operator is a shorthand for `a = a + c`, which is not the same as `a = c + a`.
