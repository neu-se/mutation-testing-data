  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.delete
```
This would result in different behavior because it would delete the current operation instead of pushing it to the delta.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would retain the current operation with a length of 0, effectively removing it from the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.insert('')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert an empty string instead of the current operation, which could change the behavior of the program.

DONE.
