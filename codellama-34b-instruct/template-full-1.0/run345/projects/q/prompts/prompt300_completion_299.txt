  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"hello"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `Q` variable, while the replacement code fragment is a string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `Q` variable, while the replacement code fragment is an empty array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was a reference to the `Q` variable, while the replacement code fragment is `undefined`.

DONE.
