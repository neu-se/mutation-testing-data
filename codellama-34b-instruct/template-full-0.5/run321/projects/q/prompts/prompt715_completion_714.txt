  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is not defined for objects in JavaScript, so it would return `undefined`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because `toString()` returns a string representation of the object, whereas the original code fragment returns the object itself.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first element of the object, whereas the original code fragment returns the object itself.

DONE.
