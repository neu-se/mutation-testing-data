  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.when()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.when()` is a function that returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in an array argument have resolved, or rejects if any of the promises in the array reject. This is different from the original code fragment `Q()`, which creates a new promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fapply()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fapply()` is a function that applies the given function, which must be a promise, to the given arguments. This is different from the original code fragment `Q()`, which creates a new promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.post()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.post()` is a function that invokes the given method in a future turn. This is different from the original code fragment `Q()`, which creates a new promise.

DONE.
