 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
b['key']
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always use the string 'key' as the key to access the value in object `b`, instead of using the dynamic key from the `key` variable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the value from object `b` with `null`, regardless of its original value. This change effectively masks the original value and may lead to incorrect behavior in the code that relies on the correct value from `b`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
(<any>b)[key]
```
This would result in different behavior because it bypasses TypeScript's type checking for the `b` object, allowing for potential type mismatches and unexpected behavior.

DONE.
