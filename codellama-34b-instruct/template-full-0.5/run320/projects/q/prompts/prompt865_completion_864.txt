  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `null` is a primitive value that does not have the same properties or methods.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `undefined` is a primitive value that does not have the same properties or methods.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
42
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects an object, but `42` is a number that does not have the same properties or methods.

DONE.
