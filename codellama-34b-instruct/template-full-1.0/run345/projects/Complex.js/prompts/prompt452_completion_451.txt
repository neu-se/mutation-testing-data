  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(z['im'] - this['im']) >= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is within a certain tolerance, while this replacement checks if it is outside of that tolerance, which changes the semantic meaning of the code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
z['im'] - this['im'] !== 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is within a certain tolerance, while this replacement checks if it is non-zero, which changes the semantic meaning of the code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.floor(z['im'] - this['im']) >= Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if the imaginary part is within a certain tolerance, while this replacement checks if it is greater than or equal to that tolerance after round
