  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(b) < Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if the imaginary part of the complex number is close to zero, rather than the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if the imaginary part of the complex number is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, rather than the real part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.abs(a) > Complex['EPSILON']
```
This would result in different behavior because this change would cause the `if` statement to only evaluate to `true` if the real part of the complex number is greater than `Complex['EPSILON']`, rather than the imaginary part.
