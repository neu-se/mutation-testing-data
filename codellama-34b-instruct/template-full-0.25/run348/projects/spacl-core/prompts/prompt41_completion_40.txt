  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a backslash instead of a forward slash.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a forward slash instead of a backslash.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\/'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match a backslash followed by a forward slash instead of a single forward slash.

DONE.
