  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a subtraction operation, while this replacement has an addition operation. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r * a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a subtraction operation, while this replacement has a multiplication operation. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r / a)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment has a subtraction operation, while this replacement has a division operation. This would cause the resulting value to be different, potentially leading to incorrect calculations.

DONE.
