  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.destroy()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `destroy` method on the read stream when the `close` event is emitted, while this modified code fragment calls `destroy` immediately after the read stream is created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.end()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only calls the `end` method on the read stream when the `close` event is emitted, while this modified code fragment calls `end` immediately after the read stream is created.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._readStream.pause()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not call the `pause` method on the read stream at all, while this modified code fragment calls `pause` immediately after the read stream is created.

DONE.
