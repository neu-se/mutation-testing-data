Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
url
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `normalizedUrl` which may have been modified before the `decodeURI(unescape(...))` call, whereas using `url` would pass the original, unmodified URL string to the `decodeURI(unescape(...))` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unescape(url)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code used `decodeURI` in addition to `unescape`, whereas this replacement would only use `unescape` and not `decodeURI`, potentially leading to different handling of URL-encoded characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because passing `null` to the `unescape` function would likely cause it to throw an error or return an incorrect result, whereas the original code passed a string (`normalizedUrl`) to the `unescape` function.

DONE.
