  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.cos
```
This would result in different behavior because `Math.cos` is a trigonometric function that returns the cosine of a given angle, while `Math.atan2` is a function that returns the arctangent of the ratio of two numbers.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i * Math.sin
```
This would result in different behavior because `i * Math.sin` is a multiplication of two constants, `i` and `Math.sin`, while `Math.atan2` is a function call to a different method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 / Math.tan
```
This would result in different behavior because `1 / Math.tan` is a division of two constants, `1` and `Math.tan`, while `Math.atan2` is a function call to a different method.

DONE.
