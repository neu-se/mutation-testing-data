  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `attributes` argument as `{}`, while this replacement passes it as `null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes || {}, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `attributes` argument as `{}`, while this replacement passes it as the result of `iter.next(1).attributes || {}`, which could be any value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
predicate(line, iter.next(1).attributes, i)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment passes the `attributes` argument as `{}`, while this replacement passes it as the result of `iter.next(1).attributes`, which could be any value.

DONE.
