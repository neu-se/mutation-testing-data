  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex + 1, baseIndex + length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the slice to start at the next index, rather than the current one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the slice to end at the previous index, rather than the current one.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex, baseIndex + length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the slice to end at the next index, rather than the current one.

DONE.
