  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() < 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would be negative, which is not a valid value for a line length.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would be zero, which would cause the predicate function to always return false and not execute the `predicate(line, {}, i)` line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.length() > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the line length would be greater than one, which would cause the predicate function to always return true and execute the `predicate(line, {}, i)` line.

DONE.
