  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
while (true) {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `while` loop would cause the function to run indefinitely, leading to a spurious positive test result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let url = new URL(currentUrlStr);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `URL` constructor would throw an exception for an invalid URL, leading to a spurious negative test result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return /[^a-z0-9\:\/\?\#\[\]\@\!\$\&\'\(\)\*\+\,\;\=\.\-\_\~\%]/i.test(str)
```
This would result in different behavior because the regex would match a different set of characters, leading to a spurious positive or negative test result depending on the input.

DONE.
