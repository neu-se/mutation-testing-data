  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because `a` is a variable that is not defined in the function, and using it would result in a reference error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"a"
```
This would result in different behavior because it would change the type of the expression from a number to a string.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value than the original code.

DONE.
