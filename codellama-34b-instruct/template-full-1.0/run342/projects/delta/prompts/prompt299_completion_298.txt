  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `line + 1` would increment the line number, whereas `line` would not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `line - 1` would decrement the line number, whereas `line` would not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `0` would not increment or decrement the line number, whereas `line + 1` or `line - 1` would.

DONE.
