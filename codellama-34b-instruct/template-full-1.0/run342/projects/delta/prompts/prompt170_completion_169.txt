  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(start - index)
```
This would result in different behavior, if the `start` parameter is greater than the `index` parameter, in the case of the left operand being "deleted" (since in the original code, the parameter in the `next` call is always `end - index`).

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(end - index)
```
This would result in different behavior because the operands are signaled as different (an inserted operand vs. a retained one), which could lead to conflicts when applying grammatical or syntactical rules.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next(index)
```
This would result in different behavior, if the `start` parameter is less than the `index` parameter, in the case of the left operand being "inserted" (since in the original code, the parameter in the `next` call is always `end - index`).
