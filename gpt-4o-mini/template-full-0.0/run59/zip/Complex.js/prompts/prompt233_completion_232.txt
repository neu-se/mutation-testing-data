Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the calculation from a scaled difference to a simple sum, which would affect the normalization of the imaginary part of the square root.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
3 * (r - a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it alters the scaling factor from 2 to 3, which would lead to a larger denominator and potentially incorrect results for the imaginary part of the square root.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * (r + a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the operation from subtraction to addition, which would incorrectly increase the denominator, affecting the calculation of the imaginary part of the square root.

DONE.
