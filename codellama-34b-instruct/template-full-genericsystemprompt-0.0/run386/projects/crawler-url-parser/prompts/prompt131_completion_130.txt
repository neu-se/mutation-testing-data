  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression `/^\/default\.[a-z]+$/` matches a different pattern than `/\index\.[a-z]+$/`, which could result in a different replacement string being returned.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
linkurl_path.replace(/\/index\.[a-z]+$/, '/').replace(/^\/default\.[a-z]+$/, '')

```
This would result
