  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(null)` would create a fulfilled promise with value `null`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a promise that is pending until `object` is resolved.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(undefined)` would create a fulfilled promise with value `undefined`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a promise that is pending until `object` is resolved.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q(0)` would create a fulfilled promise with value `0`, whereas `Q(object)` would create a promise that is pending until `object` is resolved.

DONE.
