  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `abs` property of the `Complex` object, which would be used in the `parse` function to determine the sign of the complex number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this['abs'] * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `abs` property of the `Complex` object, which would be used in the `parse` function to determine the sign of the complex number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a different value for the `abs` property of the `Complex` object, which would be used in the `parse` function to determine the sign of the complex number.

DONE.
