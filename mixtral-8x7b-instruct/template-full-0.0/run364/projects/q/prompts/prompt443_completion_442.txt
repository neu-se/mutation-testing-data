 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would receive `null` as the first argument instead of the actual error object. This could cause issues if the `process.emit` function relies on the error object to handle the unhandled rejection.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
{}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `process.emit` function call in the `trackRejection` function would receive an empty object as the first argument instead of the actual error object. This could cause issues if the `process.emit` function relies on the error object to handle the unhandled rejection.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
new Error('Dummy error')
