  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the size of the data, while this new code would emit an event with an empty object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(this._data.size)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the size of the data, while this new code would emit an event with the size of the data multiplied by 2.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.emit(this._data.size * 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code emits an event with the size of the data, while this new code would emit an event with the size of the data multiplied by 4.

DONE.
