  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'a'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `a` element is not the same as the `base` element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('b')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `b` element is not the same as the `base` element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
$('a').first()
```
This would result in different behavior because the first `a` element is not the same as the `base` element.

DONE.
