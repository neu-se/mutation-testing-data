  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof ReturnValue !== "string"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not a string, while the new code fragment checks if `ReturnValue` is not undefined. This change would cause the `isStopIteration` function to return `false` when `ReturnValue` is a string, which could lead to incorrect behavior in the program.

DONE.
