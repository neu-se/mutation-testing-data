  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, value]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two elements instead of just the key, which could cause the `delete` operation to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, undefined]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two elements, where the second element is `undefined`, which could cause the `delete` operation to fail or behave unexpectedly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[key, null]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass an array with two elements, where the second element is `null`, which could cause the `delete` operation to fail or behave unexpectedly.

DONE.
