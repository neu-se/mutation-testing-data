  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezone(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function instead of the `getCountry` function, which would return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getCountry(c, { deprecated: true })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getCountry` function with a different set of options, which would return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(c) => getTimezonesForCountry(c, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezonesForCountry` function instead of the `getCountry` function, which would return a different result.

DONE.
