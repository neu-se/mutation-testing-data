  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"promise", definition * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the function to return a different value, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail.

DONE.
