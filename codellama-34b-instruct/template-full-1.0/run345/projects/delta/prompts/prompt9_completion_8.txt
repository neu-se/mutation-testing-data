  Option 1:
```
for (const key in a) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of `a`, including inherited properties, whereas the original code only iterates over the own properties of `a`.

Option 2:
```
for (const key in b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of `b`, including inherited properties, whereas the original code only iterates over the own properties of `a`.

Option 3:
```
for (const key in a.b) {
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of `a.b`, including inherited properties, whereas the original code only iterates over the own properties of `a`.

DONE.
