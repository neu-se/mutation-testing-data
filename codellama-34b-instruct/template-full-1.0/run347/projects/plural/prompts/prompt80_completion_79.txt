  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goosese'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return a different output for the input "goose".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goosey'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return a different output for the input "goose".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'goouses'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the plural function to return a different output for the input "goose".

DONE.
