  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__minimumStackCounter__" + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would increment the value of `__minimumStackCounter__` by 1, which would cause the `stackCounter` to be greater than the value of `__minimumStackCounter__` in the `promise` object, and therefore the `if` condition would not be satisfied.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__minimumStackCounter__" - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would decrement the value of `__minimumStackCounter__` by 1, which would cause the `stackCounter` to be less than the value of `__minimumStackCounter__` in the `promise` object, and therefore the `if` condition would not be satisfied.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"__minimumStackCounter__" * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because
