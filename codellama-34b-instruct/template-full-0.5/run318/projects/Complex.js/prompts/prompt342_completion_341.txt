  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is an integer, while the new code fragment `a + 1` is a float. This could cause issues in the surrounding code, especially if it relies on the integer-ness of the value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a * b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single value, while the new code fragment `a * b` is the product of two values. This could cause issues in the surrounding code, especially if it relies on the value of `a` being a single value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `a` is a single value, while the new code fragment `a - b` is the difference of two values. This could cause issues in the surrounding code, especially if it relies on the value of
