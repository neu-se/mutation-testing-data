  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this replacement checks if `value` is null.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
value !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this replacement checks if `value` is not null and not undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `value` is not null, while this replacement checks if `value` is falsy.

DONE.
