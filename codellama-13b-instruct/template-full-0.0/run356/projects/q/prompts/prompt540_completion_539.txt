  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(void 0, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the `this` argument set to `void 0`, which is the same as `undefined`. This means that the `fulfilled` function will be called with the global object as its `this` value, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the `this` argument set to `value`, which is the value of the `value` variable. This means that the `fulfilled` function will be called with the `value` object as its `this` value, which may not be what the developer intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fulfilled.apply(null, array);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `apply` method is called with the
