  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, and `b + 1` would add 1 to the value of `b`, which could change the result of the comparison.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
c
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, and `c` is a different variable, which could have a different value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is a variable, and `this.b` would refer to a different variable, which could have a different value.

DONE.
