  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from 1 instead of 0, and the first iteration would be skipped.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = tokens.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last index of the array instead of the first, and the last iteration would be skipped.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var i = Math.floor(Math.random() * tokens.length)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from a random index of the array instead of the first, and the iterations would be in a random order.

DONE.
