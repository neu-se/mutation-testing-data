  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
deferred
```
This would result in different behavior because `deferred` is a Promise, and calling `then()` on it would return a new Promise that is resolved with the value of `deferred.promise`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.resolve()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.resolve()` returns a resolved Promise, and calling `then()` on it would return a new Promise that is resolved with the value of the resolved Promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Promise.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Promise.reject()` returns a rejected Promise, and calling `then()` on it would return a new Promise that is rejected with the value of the rejected Promise.

DONE.
