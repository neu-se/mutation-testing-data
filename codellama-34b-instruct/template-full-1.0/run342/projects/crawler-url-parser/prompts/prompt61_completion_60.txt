  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URl.serialize
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.serialize()` returns a string that represents the URL, while `URL.format()` returns a string that represents the URL in a canonical form.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.parse
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.parse()` returns an object that contains the components of the URL, while `URL.format()` returns a string that represents the URL in a canonical form.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
URL.resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because `URL.resolve()` returns a string that represents the resolved URL, while `URL.format()` returns a string that represents the URL in a canonical form.

DONE.
