  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisArg.unshift
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisArg` would not be an array, which is required by the `unshift` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a different method than `unshift`, which would not have the same effect on the arguments array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
varArgs.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `varArgs` is not defined in the scope of the `nbind` method, and would therefore produce an error.

DONE.
