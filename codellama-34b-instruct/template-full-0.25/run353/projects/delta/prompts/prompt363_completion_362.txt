  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.hasNext` is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the iterator has more elements, while `otherIter.hasNext()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is a boolean value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.peekLength` is a function that returns the length of the next element in the iterator, while `otherIter.peekLength()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because `otherIter.next` is a function that returns the next element in the iterator, while `otherIter.next()` is a function call that returns the result of the function, which is an object.
