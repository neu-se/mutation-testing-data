  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"http://" + baseUrlStr
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to parse a URL with a protocol, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("http://", "https://")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to parse a URL with a different protocol, which is not the case in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseUrlStr.replace("://", "://www.")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `URL.parse` function to parse a URL with a different hostname, which is not the case in the original code.

DONE.
