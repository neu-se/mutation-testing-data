  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only pass the first argument to the callback function, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments except the first one to the callback function, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat(["extra argument"])
```
This would result in different behavior because it would pass all the arguments and an extra argument to the callback function, instead of passing all the arguments as an array.

DONE.
