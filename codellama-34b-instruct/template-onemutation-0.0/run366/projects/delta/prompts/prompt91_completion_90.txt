  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof newOp.attributes === 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `newOp.attributes` is an object, but the replaced code fragment checks if it is a string. This could cause the `push` method to behave differently when it encounters an attribute that is not an object.

DONE.
