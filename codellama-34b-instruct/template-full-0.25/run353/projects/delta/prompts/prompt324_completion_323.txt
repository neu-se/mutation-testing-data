  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex - length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to decrease by `length`, which could lead to incorrect calculations and behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex * length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to be multiplied by `length`, which could lead to incorrect calculations and behavior in the surrounding code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseIndex / length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `baseIndex` to be divided by `length`, which could lead to incorrect calculations and behavior in the surrounding code.

DONE.
