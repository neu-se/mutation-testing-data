  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the logarithm of the hypotenuse is being calculated, but the code fragment is adding 1 to b before using it in the calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the logarithm of the hypotenuse is being calculated, but the code fragment is subtracting b from itself instead of adding it to b.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the logarithm of the hypotenuse is being calculated, but the code fragment is doubling b instead of adding it to itself.

DONE.
