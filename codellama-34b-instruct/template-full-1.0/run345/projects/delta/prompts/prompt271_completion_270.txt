  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.hasNext() === otherIter.hasNext()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if there are any operations left in either iterator, while the new code only checks if they are equal in number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() !== otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if there are any operations left in either iterator, while the new code checks if they have different lengths.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next().length !== otherIter.next().length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks if there are any operations left in either iterator, while the new code checks if the length of the next operation is different for each iterator.

DONE.
