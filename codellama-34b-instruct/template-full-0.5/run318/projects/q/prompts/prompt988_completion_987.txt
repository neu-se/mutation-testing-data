  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"put", [name, nodeArgs]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `post` method is replaced with `put`, which is a different HTTP method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs, 42]
```
This would result in different behavior because an extra argument is added to the `nodeArgs` array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post", [name, nodeArgs.concat(42)]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `nodeArgs` array is concatenated with the value `42`, which changes the arguments passed to the method.

DONE.
