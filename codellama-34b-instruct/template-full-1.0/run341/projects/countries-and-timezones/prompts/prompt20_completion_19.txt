  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone || timezone.aliasOf
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds an additional check for the existence of the `aliasOf` property in the `timezone` object, which was not present in the original code fragment. If the `timezone` object does not have this property, the function will return `null`, even if it has a valid `timezone` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
timezone !== null && !timezone.hasOwnProperty('aliasOf')
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks if the `timezone` object has the `aliasOf` property, and if it does not, it returns `null`. This is the opposite of the original code fragment, which returns `null` if the `timezone` object does not exist or if it does not have the `aliasOf` property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!timezone.getAlias()
```
This would result in
