  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `delete`, and it would retain the deleted content instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push
```
This would result in different behavior because `push` is a different method than `delete`, and it would add the deleted content to the delta instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `delete`, and it would insert the deleted content instead of deleting it.

DONE.
