  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isFinite
```
This would result in different behavior because `isFinite` checks whether a value is a finite number, while `isNaN` checks whether a value is not a number.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` is a static method of the `Number` object that checks whether a value is not a number, while `isNaN` is a global function that checks whether a value is not a number or a string that can be converted to a number.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!Number.isNaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `!Number.isNaN` checks whether a value is not a number, while `isNaN` checks whether a value is not a number or a string that can be converted to a number.

DONE.
