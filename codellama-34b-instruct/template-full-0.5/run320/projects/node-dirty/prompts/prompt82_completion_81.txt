  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.includes('\n')
```
This would result in different behavior because `includes()` checks if a string includes a certain sequence of characters, while `lastIndexOf()` checks for the last occurrence of a character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.split('\n').length > 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `split()` returns an array of strings split by the given separator, while `lastIndexOf()` checks for the last occurrence of a character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
chunk.indexOf('\n') !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because `indexOf()` checks if a string contains a certain sequence of characters, while `lastIndexOf()` checks for the last occurrence of a character.

DONE.
