  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function call, but `null` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function call, but `undefined` is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
mapper
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `prop` is a function call, but `mapper` is a variable that is not a function and would cause a runtime error.

DONE.
