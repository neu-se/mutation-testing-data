Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
throw new Error("Invalid type");
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of calling `parser_exit()`, which may handle the error gracefully, it throws an error that could terminate the program or require additional error handling.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return null;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `null` instead of calling `parser_exit()` means that the function will return a value, potentially leading to further processing of a `null` result, which may not be handled correctly by the calling code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because returning `undefined` instead of calling `parser_exit()` allows the function to complete without an explicit error, which could lead to unexpected behavior in the rest of the application if the calling code does not check for `undefined`.

DONE.
