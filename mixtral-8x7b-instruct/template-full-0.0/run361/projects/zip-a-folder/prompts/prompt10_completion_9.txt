 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
fs.constants.F_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because it checks for the existence of the file, not read permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
isGlob.sync
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the synchronous version of the function, which could block the event loop.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
global.isGlob
```
This would result in different behavior because it accesses the `isGlob` function from the global scope, which might not exist if the module is not loaded.

DONE.
