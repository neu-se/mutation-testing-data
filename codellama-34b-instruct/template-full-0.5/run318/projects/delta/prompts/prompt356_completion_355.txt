  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition()
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.transformPosition()` returns a new `Delta` object, while `this.transformPosition` is a method that mutates the current `Delta` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.transformPosition(1)` would transform the position by 1, while `this.transformPosition` without an argument would transform the position by the current delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.transformPosition(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.transformPosition(0)` would not transform the position at all, while `this.transformPosition` without an argument would transform the position by the current delta.

DONE.
