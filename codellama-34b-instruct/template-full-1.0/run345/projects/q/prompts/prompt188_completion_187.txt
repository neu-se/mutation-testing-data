  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/attempt2/ exec /lineNumber:\d+/).\[2\];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only the line number from the `attempt2` group instead of the entire line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\(module\.js:\d+\)/ exec /lineNumber:\d+/).\[2\];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only the line number from the `/(module\.js:\d+)/` group instead of the entire line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(/\d+$/ exec /lineNumber:\d+/).\[2\];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would match only the line number from the `/\d+$/` group instead of the entire line.

DONE.
