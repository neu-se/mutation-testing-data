  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment is case-sensitive, while the new code fragment is not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment returns the entire word, while the new code fragment returns the word without the first character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
word.replace('e', '3')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not modify the word, while the new code fragment replaces the letter 'e' with the number '3'.

DONE.
