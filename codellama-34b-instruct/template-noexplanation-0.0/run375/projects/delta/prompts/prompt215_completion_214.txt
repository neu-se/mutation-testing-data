  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.slice()
```
This code fragment will return a shallow copy of the `ops` array, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.splice(0)
```
This code fragment will remove all elements from the `ops` array, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
delta.ops.pop()
```
This code fragment will remove the last element from the `ops` array, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

DONE.
