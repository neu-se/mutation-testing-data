  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `in` operator to iterate over the properties of the `sinks` object, while the modified code fragment uses the `=` operator to assign the value `0` to the variable `k`. The `in` operator checks for the presence of a property in an object, while the `=` operator assigns a value to a variable.

DONE.
