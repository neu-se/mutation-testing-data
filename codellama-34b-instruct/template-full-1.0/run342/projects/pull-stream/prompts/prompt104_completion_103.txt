  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not called, and the `done` callback is called with an undefined value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not called, and the `done` callback is called with a null value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
unresolved
```
This would result in different behavior because the `drain` function is not called, and the `done` callback is called with a rejection reason.

DONE.
