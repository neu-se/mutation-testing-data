  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.chop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `chop()` method is called on the `retDelta` object, which would remove any trailing newline characters from the delta. This could potentially cause issues if the delta is being used in a context where trailing newline characters are important.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.ops
```
This would result in different behavior because the `ops` property of the `retDelta` object is returned, which would return the raw operation list rather than the transformed delta. This could potentially cause issues if the operation list is being used in a context where the transformed delta is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.compose(other)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compose()` method is called on the `retDelta` object, which would compose the `other` delta with the `retDelta` object. This could potentially cause issues if the `other` delta is not compatible with
