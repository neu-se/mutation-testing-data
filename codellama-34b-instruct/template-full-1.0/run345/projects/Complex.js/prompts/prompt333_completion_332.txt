  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == -2
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether b is equal to -1, while the changed code checks whether b is equal to -2, which is a different constant.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
2 * b == -1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether b is equal to -1, while the changed code checks whether 2*b is equal to -1, which is a different operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b == -1 - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code checks whether b is equal to -1, while the changed code checks whether b is equal to -1 - 1, which is equal to -2, which is a different constant.

DONE.
