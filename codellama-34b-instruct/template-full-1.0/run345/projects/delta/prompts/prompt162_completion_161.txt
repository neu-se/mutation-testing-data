  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next
```
This would result in different behavior because `thisIter` and `otherIter` are different iterators that iterate over different objects. Replacing `otherIter.next` with `thisIter.next` would lead to a different iteration order, which could cause the subsequent code to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and would cause the code to throw an error when trying to call it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Hello World!")
```
This would result in different behavior because `console.log()` is a function that prints a message to the console, which is not the intended behavior of the code in this context.

DONE.
