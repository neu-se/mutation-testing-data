  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the length of the `promises` array instead of the array itself, which would cause the `allSettled` method to fail.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the first promise in the `promises` array instead of the entire array, which would cause the `allSettled` method to fail.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promises.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return a new array containing all but the first promise in the `promises` array, which would cause the `allSettled` method to fail.

DONE.
