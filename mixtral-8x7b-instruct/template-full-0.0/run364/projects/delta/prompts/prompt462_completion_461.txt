 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.slice(this.index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it skips the current operation instead of including it in the rest of the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.slice(0, this.index)
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the operations before the current one instead of the remaining operations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.ops.filter(op => op !== this.ops[this.index])
```
This would result in different behavior because it removes the current operation from the rest of the array instead of including it.

DONE.
