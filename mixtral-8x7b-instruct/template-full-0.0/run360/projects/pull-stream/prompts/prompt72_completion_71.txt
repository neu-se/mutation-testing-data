 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks if the `data` is an empty array, which was not the case in the original code. The function would behave differently if the stream emits an empty array as data.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks if the `data` is `null`, which was not the case in the original code. The function would behave differently if the stream emits `null` as data.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && op(data).length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the code now checks if the `op` function returns an array with a length greater than 0. The function would behave differently if the `op` function returns an array instead of the original `data`.

DONE.
