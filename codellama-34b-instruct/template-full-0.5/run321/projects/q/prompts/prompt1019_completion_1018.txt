  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.bind(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.bind(this)` creates a new function that is bound to `this`, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the original function. If the original function is replaced or modified, the bound function will still refer to the original function, which may not be the desired behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.call(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.call(this)` calls the `dispatch` method immediately, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the method that can be called later.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.dispatch.apply(this)
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.dispatch.apply(this)` calls the `dispatch` method immediately with the given arguments, whereas `this.dispatch` is a reference to the method that can be called later with different
