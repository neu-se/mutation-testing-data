  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path.extname(options.dest)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the file extension of the destination file, regardless of whether it exists or not. In the original code, the `!path.extname(options.dest)` condition checks if the file extension of the destination file is non-empty, which is a stricter check that ensures that the destination file has a valid file extension.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.endsWith('.')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the destination file has a file extension that ends with a dot, which is a different condition from checking if the file extension is non-empty.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!options.dest.match(/\.[^.]+$/)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the destination file has a file extension that matches a dot followed by one or more non-dot characters,
