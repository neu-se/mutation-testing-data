  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games, illnesses, misc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array, rather than modifying the original array in place.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.push(games, illnesses, misc)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `push` method modifies the original array, rather than returning a new array.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
clothes.concat(games, illnesses, misc).join('|')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `join` method returns a string, rather than an array.

DONE.
