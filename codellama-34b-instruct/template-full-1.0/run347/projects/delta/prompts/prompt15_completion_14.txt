  Sure, here are three potential buggy code fragments that could be used to replace the PLACEHOLDER in the code:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a === null
```
This would result in different behavior because `a === null` checks if `a` is null, which is different from `typeof a !== 'object'`, which checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a !== b
```
This would result in different behavior because `a !== b` checks if `a` is not equal to `b`, which is different from `typeof a !== 'object'`, which checks if `a` is not an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a.constructor.name !== 'Object'
```
This would result in different behavior because `a.constructor.name` checks if the constructor of `a` is not equal to 'Object', which is different from `typeof a !== 'object'`, which checks if `a` is not
