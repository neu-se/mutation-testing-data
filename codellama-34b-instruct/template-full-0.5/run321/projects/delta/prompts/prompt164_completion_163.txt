  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for inequality, whereas the original code fragment used the `===` operator to check for equality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekType() !== 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check the type of the operation in the other iterator, whereas the original code fragment checked the type of the operation in the current iterator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check for the type of the operation in the current iterator to be 'insert', whereas the original code fragment checked for 'delete'.

DONE.
