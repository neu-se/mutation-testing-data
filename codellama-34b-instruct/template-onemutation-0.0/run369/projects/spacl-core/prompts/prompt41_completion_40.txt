  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `/` character to match a literal forward slash, while the new code fragment uses the `\\` character to match a literal backslash. This change would cause the regular expression to match a different set of strings.

DONE.
