  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, which could cause the `exp` function to produce a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, which could cause the `exp` function to produce a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sqrt` function would return a different value, which could cause the `exp` function to produce a different result.

DONE.
