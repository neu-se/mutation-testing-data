  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.call
```
This would result in different behavior because `call` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and accepts an argument list, while `apply` is a method that invokes a function with a given `this` value and accepts an array of arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { return callback.apply(arguments); }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would create a new function that returns the result of invoking `callback` with the `arguments` object as its `this` value and the argument list as its arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.apply(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would invoke `callback` with `null` as its `this` value and an empty argument list.

DONE.
