  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a` is used to calculate the real part.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the imaginary part of the complex number, while `b + 1` would result in a different imaginary part.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `b` is used to calculate the imaginary part of the complex number, while `a + b` would result in a different imaginary part.

DONE.
