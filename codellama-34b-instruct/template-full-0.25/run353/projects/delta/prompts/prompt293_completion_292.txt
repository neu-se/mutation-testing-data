  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.delete(index);
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.delete(index)` would delete the character at the specified index in the line, whereas `line.push` would add the character to the end of the line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.retain(index);
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.retain(index)` would retain the character at the specified index in the line, whereas `line.push` would add the character to the end of the line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
line.insert(index, ' ');
```
This would result in different behavior because `line.insert(index, ' ')` would insert a space character at the specified index in the line, whereas `line.push` would add the character to the end of the line.

DONE.
