  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\b(?:tools|clothes|games|illnesses|misc)s\\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the word "tools" instead of the array of words.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\b(?:trouser|pant|pantie|clothe)s\\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the word "trouser" instead of the array of words.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/\\b(?:billiard|bowl|card|dart|skittle|draught)s\\b/i
```
This would result in different behavior because it matches the word "billiard" instead of the array of words.

DONE.
