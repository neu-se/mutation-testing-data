  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes the starting index and the length of the substring as arguments, and `1` would result in a substring starting from the second character instead of the first.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes the starting index and the length of the substring as arguments, and `-1` would result in a substring starting from the last character instead of the first.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
length - 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `substr` method takes the starting index and the length of the substring as arguments, and `length - 2` would result in a substring starting from the second-to-last character instead of the first.

DONE.
