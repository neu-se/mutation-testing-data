  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "function"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would execute the `else` block if `bootstrap` is not a function, whereas the original code would execute the `if` block if `bootstrap` is a function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap !== "undefined"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator checks for strict inequality, so the code would execute the `else` block if `bootstrap` is not undefined, whereas the original code would execute the `if` block if `bootstrap` is undefined.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof bootstrap === "object"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the code would execute the `if` block if `bootstrap` is an object, whereas the original code would execute the `else` block if `bootstrap` is not an object
