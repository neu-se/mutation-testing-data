 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback might receive `null` instead of the expected progress value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would always receive a number, possibly modifying the original progress value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
this.value
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressed` callback would use the value of the current promise instead of the progress value.

DONE.
