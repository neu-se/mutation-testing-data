  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `null` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value would be passed as an additional argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
rejection, reason, {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the `{}` object would be passed as an additional argument to the `untrackRejection` function, which would cause the function to throw an error.

DONE.
