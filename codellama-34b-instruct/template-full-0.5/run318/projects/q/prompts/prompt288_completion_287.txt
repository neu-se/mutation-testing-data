  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.resolve(resolver);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.resolve` is a function that resolves the promise with the given value, whereas `resolver` is a function that takes the `resolve` and `reject` functions as arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.reject(resolver);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.reject` is a function that rejects the promise with the given reason, whereas `resolver` is a function that takes the `resolve` and `reject` functions as arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise.notify(resolver);
```
This would result in different behavior because `promise.notify` is a function that notifies the promise with the given progress, whereas `resolver` is a function that takes the `resolve` and `reject` functions as arguments.

DONE.
