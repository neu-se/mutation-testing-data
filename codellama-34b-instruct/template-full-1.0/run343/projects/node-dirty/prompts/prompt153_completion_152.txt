  DONE.

Here are the three options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.pipe(process.stdout);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only writes to the write stream, but this code fragment would also write to the standard output stream.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.close();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only corks the write stream, but this code fragment would close it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._writeStream.destroy();
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment only corks the write stream, but this code fragment would destroy it.
