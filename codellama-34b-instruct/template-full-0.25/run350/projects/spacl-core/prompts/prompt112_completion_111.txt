  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.keys(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of the keys in the `verbs` object, whereas `for...of` iterates over the values of the object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.values(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.values()` returns an array of the values in the `verbs` object, whereas `for...of` iterates over the values of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
for (const verb of Object.entries(verbs)) {
```
This would result in different behavior because `Object.entries()` returns an array of the key-value pairs in the `verbs` object, whereas `for...of` iterates over the values of the object.

DONE.
