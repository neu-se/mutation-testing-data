  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to `policy`, rather than the value of the `policy` property to `policy`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, this.get(policy.name))
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to the value of the `policy.name` property, rather than the value of the `policy` property to `policy`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.set(policy.name, policy.name)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the value of the `policy.name` property to the value of the `policy.name` property, rather than the value of the `policy` property to `policy`.

DONE.
