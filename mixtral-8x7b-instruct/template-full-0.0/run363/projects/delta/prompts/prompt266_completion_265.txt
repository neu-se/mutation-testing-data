 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it always uses a fixed length of 0 instead of the actual length of `opLength`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
thisIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the current operation in the `this` Delta instead of the length of the operation in the `other` Delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses a random number as the length, which can cause unexpected behavior in the `retain` and `delete` operations.

DONE.
