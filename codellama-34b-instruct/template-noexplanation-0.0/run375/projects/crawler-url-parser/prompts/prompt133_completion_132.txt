  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\'
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of `/` with a backslash, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'\\\\'
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of `/` with a double backslash, which is a different behavior than the original code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'/'
```
This will cause the `replace` method to replace the last occurrence of `/` with a forward slash, which is the same behavior as the original code fragment.

DONE.
