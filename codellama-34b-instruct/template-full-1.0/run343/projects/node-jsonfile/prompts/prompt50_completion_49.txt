  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null, str, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `file` argument is now `null`, which would cause the `fs.writeFileSync` method to throw an error instead of writing to the file.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, null, options
```
This would result in different behavior because the `str` argument is now `null`, which would cause the `JSON.stringify` method to throw an error instead of returning a string representation of the object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
file, str, options.reviver
```
This would result in different behavior because the `options` argument is now `options.reviver`, which is a function that is used to customize the parsing of JSON data. If the `reviver` function is not provided, the default behavior of the `JSON.parse` method will be used, which may result in different behavior.

DONE.
