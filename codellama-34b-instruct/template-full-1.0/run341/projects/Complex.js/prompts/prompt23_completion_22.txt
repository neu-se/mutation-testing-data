  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a > b
```
This would result in different behavior because the inequality operator is flipped, causing the condition to evaluate to the opposite result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a + b
```
This would result in different behavior because the addition operator would produce a different value, which would then be evaluated in the context of the if statement.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b - a
```
This would result in different behavior because the subtraction operator would produce a different value, which would then be evaluated in the context of the if statement.

DONE.
