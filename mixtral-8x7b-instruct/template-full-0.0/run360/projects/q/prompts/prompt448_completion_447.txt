 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
[]
```
This would result in different behavior because instead of tracking the rejection in the correct `unhandledRejections` array, it would always push an empty array, which would not accurately represent the unhandled rejections.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.length++
```
This would result in different behavior because it increments the length of the `unhandledRejections` array instead of pushing the promise to the array, which would lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
unhandledRejections.concat(promise)
```
This would result in different behavior because it creates a new array with the `unhandledRejections` array and the `promise` as elements, instead of modifying the original `unhandledRejections` array. This would lead to incorrect tracking of unhandled rejections.

DONE.
