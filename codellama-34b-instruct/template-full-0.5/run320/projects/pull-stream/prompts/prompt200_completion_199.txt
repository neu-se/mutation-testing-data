  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!busy
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `busy` is a boolean value that indicates whether the map function is currently running. Replacing it with `!busy` would invert the boolean value, meaning that the code would behave as if the map function is not running, even if it is. This could cause the code to behave incorrectly in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy && false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `busy` is a boolean value that indicates whether the map function is currently running. Replacing it with `busy && false` would cause the code to always evaluate to `false`, even if the map function is running. This could cause the code to behave incorrectly in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
busy || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `busy` is a boolean value that indicates whether the
