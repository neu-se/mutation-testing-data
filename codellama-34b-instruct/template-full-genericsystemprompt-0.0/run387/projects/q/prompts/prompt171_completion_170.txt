  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, as `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from Node.js, and the `stackLine` variable is not a Node.js stack line.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!isNodeFrame(stackLine)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, as `isNodeFrame` is a function that checks if a stack line is from Node.js, and the `stackLine` variable is not a Node.js stack line.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stackLine.indexOf("(module.js:") !== -1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would check if the stack line contains the string `"(module.js:"`, which is not the same as checking if the stack line is from Node.js.

DONE.
