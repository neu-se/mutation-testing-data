  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'object'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block in the `concat` method, which would append the `ops` property of `other` to the `ops` property of `retDelta`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'function'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `else` block in the `concat` method, which would call the `ops` property of `other` with the `ops` property of `retDelta` as an argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof thisOp.retain === 'undefined'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the code to enter the `if` block in the `concat` method, which would append the `ops` property of `other` to the `ops` property of `retDelta` only
