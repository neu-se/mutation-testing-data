  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
urlMap.keys
```
This would result in different behavior because `keys` returns an iterator over the keys of the map, while `values` returns an iterator over the values of the map. In this case, the `extract` function expects an iterator over the values of the map, so replacing `values` with `keys` would cause the function to iterate over the wrong data.
