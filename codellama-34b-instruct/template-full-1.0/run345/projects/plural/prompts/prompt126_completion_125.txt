  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num !== 1 && num !== undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this replacement would check if `num` is not equal to 1 and also not undefined. This would cause the `plural` function to return a different result for some inputs, such as the number 1.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === 1 || num === "one"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `num` is not equal to 1 or if it is undefined, while this replacement would check if `num` is equal to 1 or the string "one". This would cause the `plural` function to return a different result for some inputs, such as the number 1 or the string "one".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
num === "one" && num !== "two"
```
This would
