  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
sin
```
This would result in different behavior because the `sin` function has a different range of values than the `cos` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1 - cos
```
This would result in different behavior because the `1 - cos` expression would always be negative, whereas the `cos` function can return positive and negative values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cos(x + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `cos(x + 1)` expression would have a different phase shift than the original `cos` function.

DONE.
