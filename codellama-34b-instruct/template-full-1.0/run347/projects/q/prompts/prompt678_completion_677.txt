  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(object).dispatch("post", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 1)])```
This would result in different behavior because by calling "post" instead of "apply", it would cause the function to be called with the wrong arguments, which would likely lead to an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```Q(object).dispatch("apply", [void 0, array_slice(arguments, 2)])```
This would result in different behavior because by calling "apply" with the wrong arguments, it would cause the function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely lead to an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

This would result in different behavior because by calling "post" with the wrong arguments, it would cause the function to be called with the wrong number of arguments, which would likely lead to an error.
