  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument, which specifies whether to parse the query string, is now set to `false`, which means that the query string will not be parsed and the `search` property of the `parsedUrl` object will be an empty string.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the third argument, which specifies whether to remove the fragment, is now set to `false`, which means that the fragment will not be removed and the `hash` property of the `parsedUrl` object will contain the fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr, false, false
```
This would result in different behavior because both the second and third arguments are now set to `false`, which means that the query string will not be parsed and the fragment will not be removed.

DONE.
