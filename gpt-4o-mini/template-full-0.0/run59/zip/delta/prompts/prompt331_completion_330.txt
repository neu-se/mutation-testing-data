Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.attributes
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the reference from the entire operation object to just its attributes, potentially leading to incorrect attribute handling during the retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.insert.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the inserted content instead of the operation itself, which could lead to incorrect retention of operations based on their length rather than their actual content.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
baseOp.retain
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces the operation with its retain value, which may not correspond to the actual operation being processed, leading to incorrect retention logic in the inversion process.

DONE.
