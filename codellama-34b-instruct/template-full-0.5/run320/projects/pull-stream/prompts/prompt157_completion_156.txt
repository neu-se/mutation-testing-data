  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(false)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with `false` as the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with `_value` as the second argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(true, _value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment calls the `cb` function with `null` as the first argument, while this modified code fragment calls it with `true` as the first argument and `_value` as the second argument.

DONE.
