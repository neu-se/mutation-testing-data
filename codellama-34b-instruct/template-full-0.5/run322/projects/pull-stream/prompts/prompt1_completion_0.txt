  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would only iterate over the first element of the `sources` object, instead of all of them.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Object.keys(sources)[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would only iterate over the first key of the `sources` object, instead of all of them.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var k = Math.random()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for` loop would iterate over a random number of elements in the `sources` object, instead of all of them.

DONE.
