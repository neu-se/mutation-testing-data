  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object instead of the `Q` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object with a `null` context, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `promise.dispatch` method to be called on the `Promise.prototype` object with an `undefined` context, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

DONE.
