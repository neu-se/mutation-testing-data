  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.file
```
This would result in different behavior because `zipArchive.file` is a method that adds a file to the archive, whereas `zipArchive.glob` is a method that adds a glob pattern to the archive. Using `zipArchive.file` would result in a different set of files being added to the archive, which could potentially cause the test to fail.

DONE.
