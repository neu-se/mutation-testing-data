 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment includes a negative character set (`[^/]`) which is replaced with a positive character set, removing the negation. This change would allow paths to contain forward slashes (`/`), which is not allowed in the original code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]*+$/
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` quantifier is replaced with a possessive quantifier (`*+`). This change would cause the regex to fail to match strings that contain a sequence of characters that can be matched by the preceding character class (`[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*]`) followed by a forward slash (`/`).

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER
