  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PLACEHOLDER = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `nearerValue` is a promise, but replacing it with 0 would make it always evaluate to false, potentially causing the promise to never be resolved or rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PLACEHOLDER = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `nearerValue` is a promise, but replacing it with 1 would make it always evaluate to true, potentially causing the promise to be resolved or rejected prematurely.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
PLACEHOLDER = error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code is checking if `nearerValue` is a promise, but replacing it with an error object would cause the promise to be rejected, potentially causing unexpected behavior in the code that uses the promise.

DONE.
