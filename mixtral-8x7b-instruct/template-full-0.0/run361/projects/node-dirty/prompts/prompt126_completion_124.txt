 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'write'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'write\_close' event is not emitted anymore, which could cause issues in the application if there are listeners waiting for this event.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'flush'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'flush' event is not a standard event in the given code, and it is unlikely that there are any listeners waiting for this event, causing unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'drain_close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the 'drain\_close' event does not exist, and it is likely that there are no listeners waiting for this event, causing unexpected behavior.

DONE.
