  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.push()
```
This would result in different behavior because `push()` requires a value to be passed as an argument, while `nodeArgs` is an empty array. The code would throw a `TypeError` when the function is called.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.concat
```
This would result in different behavior because `concat` concatenates two arrays, while `nodeArgs` is an empty array. The code would throw a `TypeError` when the function is called.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeArgs.shift
```
This would result in different behavior because `shift` removes the first element of an array, while `nodeArgs` is an empty array. The code would throw a `TypeError` when the function is called.

DONE.
