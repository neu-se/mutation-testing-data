  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because `false` is a different value than `true`, which would cause the `else` block to be evaluated, even if `value != null`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a different value than `true`, which would cause the `else` block to be evaluated, even if `value != null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!value
```
This would result in different behavior because `!value` is a different condition than `value != null`. It would cause the `else` block to be evaluated if `value` is falsy, not just if it is `null`.

DONE.
