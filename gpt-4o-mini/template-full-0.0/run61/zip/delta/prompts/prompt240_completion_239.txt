Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.peekLength()
```
This would result in different behavior because it uses the length of the `otherIter` instead of `thisIter`, potentially leading to incorrect deletions if the lengths of the two iterators differ.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always delete zero characters, effectively making the delete operation a no-op, which could lead to unexpected results in the delta.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekLength() + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to delete one more character than available, which could cause an out-of-bounds error or incorrect state in the delta.

DONE.
