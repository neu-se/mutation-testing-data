Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while the new code fragment does not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment throws an error, while the new code fragment does not.
