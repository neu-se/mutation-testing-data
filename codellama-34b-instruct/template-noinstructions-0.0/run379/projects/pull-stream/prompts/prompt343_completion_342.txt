  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `null` is a null value. This change would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a null value instead of a boolean value, which may cause the callback to behave differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `undefined` is a special value that indicates the absence of a value. This change would cause the `onAbort` callback to be called with a value that is not a boolean, which may cause the callback to behave differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `abort` is a boolean value, while `false` is a boolean value that is the opposite of `true`. This change would cause the `onAbort` callback to be
