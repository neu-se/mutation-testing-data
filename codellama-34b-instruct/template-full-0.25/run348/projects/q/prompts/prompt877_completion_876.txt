  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.slice(1)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slice` method returns a new array with a subset of the elements from the original array, starting from the index `1` in this case. This would cause the `nodeArgs` array to be missing the first element, which may cause the `FS.readFile` function to not work as intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.concat([null])
```
This would result in different behavior because the `concat` method returns a new array with the elements of the original array followed by the elements of the argument array. In this case, the argument array is `[null]`, which would cause the `nodeArgs` array to have an extra `null` element at the end. This may cause the `FS.readFile` function to not work as intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args.filter(function(arg) { return arg !== null; })
```
This would
