 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Q.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `defer()` function call is replaced with an immediate resolution, which might not allow the timeout functionality to work correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
Promise.resolve(<PLACEHOLDER>)
