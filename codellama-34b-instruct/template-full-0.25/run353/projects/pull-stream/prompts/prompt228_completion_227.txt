  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is a logical NOT, which would negate the result of the `test` function, potentially causing the `filter` function to return the opposite of what it should.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator is an addition, which would add 1 to the result of the `test` function, potentially causing the `filter` function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `length` property is a property of an array, and the `data` variable is not an array, so this would cause an error.

DONE.
