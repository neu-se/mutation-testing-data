  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.fcall()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.fcall()` is a function that returns a promise for the result of calling the given function in the next turn of the event loop, whereas the original code `callback` is a function that is called immediately.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.reject()` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas the original code `callback` is a function that is called immediately.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.defer()` is a function that returns a deferred object that can be used to construct a promise, whereas the original code `callback` is a function that is called immediately.

DONE.
