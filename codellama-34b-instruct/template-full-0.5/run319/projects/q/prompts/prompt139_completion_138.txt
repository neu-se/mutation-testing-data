  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would not execute, as the condition `!!p` would be false.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = promise.source;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the value of `p` would be `promise.source`, which is truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var p = !promise;
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would execute one extra time, as the value of `p` would be `!promise`, which is truthy.

DONE.
