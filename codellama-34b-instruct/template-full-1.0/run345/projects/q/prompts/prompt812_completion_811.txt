  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.bind()
```
This would result in different behavior because `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments, whereas `bind` is a method that creates a new function with the same body as the original function, but with a different `this` value. In this case, the original code uses `fcall` to call `regardless` with no arguments, but if `callback.bind()` is used instead, `regardless` will be called with the `this` value set to `callback`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
callback.valueOf()
```
This would result in different behavior because `valueOf` is a method that returns the primitive value of an object, whereas `fcall` is a method that calls a function with the given arguments. In this case, the original code uses `fcall` to call `regardless` with no arguments, but if `callback.valueOf()` is used instead, `regardless` will be called with the `this` value set to `callback
