  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value and not a function, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive value and not a function, so it would cause a runtime error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
() => {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the function returns `undefined`, which is not the same as the original code fragment, which returns `void 0`, which is a way of writing `undefined` in JavaScript.

DONE.
