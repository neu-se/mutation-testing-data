  
Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.reject(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.reject` function returns a rejected promise with the provided value, which would cause the surrounding code to handle the rejection differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.resolve(reason)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.resolve` function returns a fulfilled promise with the provided value, which would cause the surrounding code to handle the fulfillment value differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.defer()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `Q.defer` function returns a deferred promise that can be resolved or rejected later, which would cause the surrounding code to handle the resolution or rejection differently.

DONE.
