  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, "foo")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether the property exists or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, "bar")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `true`, regardless of whether the property exists or not.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(this, "baz")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return `false`, regardless of whether the property exists or not.

DONE.
