  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).then(function() { throw new Error("test"); });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `then` method is called on the return value of `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which is a promise. The `then` method takes two arguments: a callback function to be called when the promise is fulfilled, and a callback function to be called when the promise is rejected. In this case, we are passing a function that throws an error as the second argument, which will cause the promise to be rejected. This will result in different behavior than the original code, which does not include the `then` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q.async(makeGenerator).catch(function(error) { throw error; });
```
This would result in different behavior because the `catch` method is called on the return value of `Q.async(makeGenerator)`, which is a promise. The `catch` method takes a callback function to be called when the promise is rejected. In this case
