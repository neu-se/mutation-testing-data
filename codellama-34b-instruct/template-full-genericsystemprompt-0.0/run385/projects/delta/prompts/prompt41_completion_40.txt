  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.keys(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the keys of the `a` object, which may not be the same as the keys of the `attributes` object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.values(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the values of the `a` object, which may not be the same as the values of the `attributes` object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Object.entries(a)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return the entries of the `a` object, which may not be the same as the entries of the `attributes` object.

DONE.
