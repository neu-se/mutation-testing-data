  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r + a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add `a` to `r` instead of subtracting it, which would cause the calculation of `r` to be incorrect.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
a - b
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `b` from `a` instead of adding it, which would cause the calculation of `r` to be incorrect.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
r - a
```
This would result in different behavior because it would subtract `a` from `r` instead of adding it, which would cause the calculation of `r` to be incorrect.

DONE.
