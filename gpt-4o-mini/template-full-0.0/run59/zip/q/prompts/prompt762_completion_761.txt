Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function(p) { return p; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would return an array of the original promises without any transformation, potentially leading to incorrect handling of the promises if they were expected to be resolved or inspected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function(p) { return Q.reject(new Error("Rejected")); })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would transform all promises into rejected promises, causing the `allResolved` function to always return an array of rejected promises, regardless of the original promises' states.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
array_map(promises, function(p) { return p + 1; })
```
This would result in different behavior because it would attempt to add 1 to each promise, which is not a valid operation, leading to unexpected results or errors when trying to resolve the promises.

DONE.
