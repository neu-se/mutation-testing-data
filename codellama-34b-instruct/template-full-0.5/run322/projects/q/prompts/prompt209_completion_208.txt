  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(null, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would ignore the `this` context of the original function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(this, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `this` context of the original function, which may not be the same as the `this` context of the callback.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return callback.apply(undefined, arguments);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would use the `undefined` context, which is different from the `this` context of the original function.

DONE.
