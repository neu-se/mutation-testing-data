  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by a different number of elements than the original code, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by one fewer element than the original code, potentially leading to a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next(length + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the iterator to advance by one more element than the original code, potentially leading to a different result.

DONE.
