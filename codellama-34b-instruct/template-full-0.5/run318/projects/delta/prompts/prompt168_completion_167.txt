  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to advance, potentially skipping over operations that should be considered in the diff.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `thisIter` iterator to advance, potentially skipping over operations that should be considered in the diff.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherIter.next()
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `otherIter` iterator to advance, potentially skipping over operations that should be considered in the diff.

DONE.
