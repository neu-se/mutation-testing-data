  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.push(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would push the callback function to the `cbs` array, but it would not call the callback function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.unshift(cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would add the callback function to the beginning of the `cbs` array, but it would not call the callback function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cbs.splice(0, 0, cb);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would insert the callback function at the beginning of the `cbs` array, but it would not call the callback function.

DONE.
