 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<div>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it adds a `<div>` element, which changes the HTML structure and might affect the behavior of the `.text()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<script>alert("XSS");</script>'
```
This would result in different behavior because it injects a script tag, which might lead to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
'<a href="https://example.com">'
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the `<a>` tag to a complete, valid link, which might affect the behavior of the `.text()` method and the URL extraction.

DONE.
