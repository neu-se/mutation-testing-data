  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
abort, cb, onAbort
```
This would result in different behavior because the order of the arguments has been changed, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `onAbort` argument has been incremented, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb, abort, onAbort * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of the `onAbort` argument has been multiplied by 2, which could cause the function to behave differently when called with different arguments.

DONE.
