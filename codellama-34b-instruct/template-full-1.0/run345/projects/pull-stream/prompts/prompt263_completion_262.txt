  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
cb(null, data)
```
This would result in different behavior because in the original code, `cb` is only called with the `err` parameter when `err` is not null. In the new code, `cb` is called with both `err` and `data` arguments, which could cause the test suite to pass even if there is an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:

cb(err, null)
