  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("My custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
console.log("Malformed data detected")
```
This would result in different behavior because it would log a message to the console instead of throwing an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("My custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the error message would be different.

DONE.
