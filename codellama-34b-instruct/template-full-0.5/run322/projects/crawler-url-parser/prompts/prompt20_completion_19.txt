  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//g
```
This would result in different behavior because the `g` flag tells the regular expression to match all occurrences in the string, not just the first one.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag tells the regular expression to ignore case, so it would match both `http://` and `https://`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/^\/\//i
```
This would result in different behavior because the `i` flag tells the regular expression to ignore case, so it would match both `http://` and `https://`.

DONE.
