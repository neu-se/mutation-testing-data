  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() >= firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `>=` is used instead of `<=` in the original code. This would cause the loop to continue even if the `firstLeft` value is negative, which could lead to an infinite loop.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() === firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the operator `===` is used instead of `<=` in the original code. This would cause the loop to continue only if the `firstLeft` value is exactly equal to the peek length, which could lead to a different outcome.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
thisIter.peekType() === 'insert' &&
        thisIter.peekLength() < firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior
