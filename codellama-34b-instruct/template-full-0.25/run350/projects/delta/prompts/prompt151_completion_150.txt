  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.delete - firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because `delete` is a different property than `retain` and would result in a different calculation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain + firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator would result in a different calculation than the `-` operator.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
firstOther.retain * firstLeft
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator would result in a different calculation than the `-` operator.

DONE.
