  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stringify(obj, options)`, which calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` and `options` arguments. However, the new code fragment only passes the `obj` argument to `stringify`, which would result in a different output.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.stringify(obj, options)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stringify(obj, options)`, which calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` and `options` arguments. However, the new code fragment calls the `JSON.stringify` function with the same arguments, which would result in a different output.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
stringify(obj, options, 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment was `stringify(obj, options)`, which calls the `stringify` function with the `obj` and `
