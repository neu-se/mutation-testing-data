  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\n" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + " "
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator is now a space instead of a newline, which could cause the stack trace to be concatenated differently.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"\t" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + "\t"
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator is now a tab character instead of a newline, which could cause the stack trace to be indented differently.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"" + STACK_JUMP_SEPARATOR + ""
```
This would result in different behavior because the separator is now an empty string, which could cause the stack trace to be concatenated differently.

DONE.
