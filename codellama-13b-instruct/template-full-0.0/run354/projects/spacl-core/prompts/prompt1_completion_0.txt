  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is used instead of `===`, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `spec` string matches the regular expression, rather than `false` as in the original code. This could potentially cause the `Matcher` constructor to throw an error when it is not supposed to, which could indicate a weakness in the test suite.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
spec.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_/:~.$+*-]*$/) === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `undefined` value is compared to the result of the `match` method, which would cause the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when the `spec` string does not match the regular expression, rather than `false` as in the original code. This could potentially
