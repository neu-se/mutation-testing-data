  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_rejected
```
This would result in different behavior because `_rejected` is a function that returns a rejected promise, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a fulfilled promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
_progressed
```
This would result in different behavior because `_progressed` is a function that returns a promise that is in a "progressed" state, whereas `_fulfilled` is a function that returns a promise that is in a "fulfilled" state.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () { throw new Error(); }
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function throws an error, whereas `_fulfilled` returns a fulfilled promise.

DONE.
