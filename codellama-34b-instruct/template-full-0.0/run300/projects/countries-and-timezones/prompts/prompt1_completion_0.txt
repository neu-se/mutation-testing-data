  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is `undefined`. If `name` is any other falsy value (e.g. `null`, `false`, `0`, etc.), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return the `buildCountry` function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is a string, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is not a string. If `name` is any other type (e.g. `number`, `boolean`, `object`, etc.), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return the `buildCountry` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name.length === 0
```
