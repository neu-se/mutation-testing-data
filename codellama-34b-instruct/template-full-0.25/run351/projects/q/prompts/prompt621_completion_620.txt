  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"get"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to set the value of a property, while the `get` method is used to retrieve the value of a property.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"delete"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to set the value of a property, while the `delete` method is used to delete a property.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"post"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `set` method is used to set the value of a property, while the `post` method is used to send a message to a value in a future turn.

DONE.
