  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
min = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `min` to 0, which allows the matcher to match an empty string. Setting `min` to 1 would require the matcher to match at least one character.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
max = 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `max` to 0, which allows the matcher to match an infinite number of characters. Setting `max` to 1 would limit the matcher to matching only one character.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
any = false
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code sets `any` to true, which allows the matcher to match any character. Setting `any` to false would require the matcher to match only the characters specified in the `parts` array.

DONE.
