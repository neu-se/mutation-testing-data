  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing `null` would result in a different error message.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"error"
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing a string would result in a different error message.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new Error("custom error message")
```
This would result in different behavior because the `reject` function expects a reason for the rejection, and passing a custom error object would result in a different error message.

DONE.
