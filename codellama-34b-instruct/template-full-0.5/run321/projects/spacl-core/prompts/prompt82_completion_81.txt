  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the `rule.matches` method would return `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the `rule.matches` method would return `true`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
0
```
This would result in different behavior because the `matches` method would always return `false`, even if the `rule.matches` method would return `true`.

DONE.
