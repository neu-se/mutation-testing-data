  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to always return an empty object, regardless of the input. This is because the `keepNull` variable is always truthy, so the `if` statement will always evaluate to `true`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!keepNull
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to always return an object with the same keys as the input object, but with all values set to `null`. This is because the `!keepNull` operator will always evaluate to `false`, so the `if` statement will always evaluate to `false`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
keepNull && !keepNull
```
This change will cause the `reduce` method to always return an object with the same keys as the input object, but with all values set to `null`. This is because the `keepNull` variable is always truthy, so the `&&` operator will always evaluate to `true`. However,
