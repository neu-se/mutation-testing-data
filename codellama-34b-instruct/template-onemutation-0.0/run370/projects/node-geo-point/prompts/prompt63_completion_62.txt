  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
φ1
```
This would result in different behavior because `φ1` is the latitude of the first point, while `φ2` is the latitude of the second point. Using `φ1` instead of `φ2` would cause the calculation to use the latitude of the first point for both points, which would result in an incorrect calculation of the bearing.
