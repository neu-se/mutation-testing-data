  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!op
```
This would result in different behavior because the negation operator (!) would flip the result of the expression to its opposite boolean value. If the original expression evaluated to `true`, the mutated expression would return `false`, and vice versa.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op || false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator would return the first truthy operand, which in this case would be the original value of `op`. If `op` was falsy, the mutated expression would return `false`, even if `op` was truthy.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op && true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator would return the first falsy operand, which in this case would be the original value of `op`. If `op` was truthy, the mutated expression would return `true`, even if `op` was falsy.
