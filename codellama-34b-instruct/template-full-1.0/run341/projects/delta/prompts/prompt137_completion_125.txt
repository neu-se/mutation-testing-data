  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof firstOther.retain === 'number' && firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow `firstOther` to have attributes, which is not allowed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof firstOther.retain !== 'number' || firstOther.attributes == null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not allow `firstOther` to have attributes, which is allowed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof firstOther.retain !== 'number' && firstOther.attributes != null
```
This would result in different behavior because it would not allow `firstOther` to have attributes if its retain is not a number, which is the opposite of the original code.

DONE.
