  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is not a function and will throw an error when called with the `apply` method, whereas `this` refers to the function itself and will not throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is not a function and will throw an error when called with the `apply` method, whereas `this` refers to the function itself and will not throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function () {}
```
This would result in different behavior because the anonymous function will return `undefined` when called, whereas `this` refers to the function itself and will return itself when called.

DONE.
