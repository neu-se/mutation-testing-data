  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code expects a GeoPoint object, but null is not a GeoPoint object and would cause a type error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.longitude
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the latitude of the current GeoPoint object, but this code would use the longitude instead.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
new GeoPoint(0, 0)
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code uses the current GeoPoint object, but this code would use a new GeoPoint object with latitude and longitude of 0.

DONE.
