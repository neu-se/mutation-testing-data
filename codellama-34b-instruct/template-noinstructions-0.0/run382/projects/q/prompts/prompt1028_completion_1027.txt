  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(null, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function with `null` as the first argument, which is not the same as calling it with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function with `value` as the first argument, which is not the same as calling it with no arguments.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
nodeback(error, value)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `nodeback` function with `error` as the first argument and `value` as the second argument, which is not the same as calling it with no arguments.

DONE.
