  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = null;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties, as `null` is not a valid object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = undefined;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would not iterate over any properties, as `undefined` is not a valid object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
var key = 0;
```
This would result in different behavior because the `for...in` loop would iterate over the object's properties with keys that are strings, but the `key` variable would be a number, causing the loop to skip over any properties with string keys.

DONE.
