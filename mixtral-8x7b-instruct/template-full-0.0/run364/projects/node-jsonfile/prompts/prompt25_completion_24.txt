 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'content'
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON parsing step would not be performed, and the `content` string would be returned instead of the parsed object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
12345
```
This would result in different behavior because the JSON parsing step would throw an error due to the invalid JSON input, and the error would be thrown instead of the parsed object or `null`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
JSON.parse('{}')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `JSON.parse` call would always return an empty object, regardless of the contents of the `content` variable. This could cause data loss if the input file was expected to contain non-empty JSON data.

DONE.
