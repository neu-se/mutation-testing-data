  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because the `progressListeners` variable is an array of listeners, and `progressListeners[0]` would only call the first listener in the array, while the original code would call all the listeners in the array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners.pop()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `pop()` method removes the last element of the `progressListeners` array, while the original code would call all the listeners in the array in order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
progressListeners[Math.floor(Math.random())]
```
This would result in different behavior because the code would call a random listener from the `progressListeners` array, rather than calling all the listeners in order as the original code does.

DONE.
