  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain` is a different method than `delete`, and it would cause the delta to retain the deleted content instead of deleting it.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).insert
```
This would result in different behavior because `insert` is a different method than `delete`, and it would cause the delta to insert the deleted content instead of deleting it.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
retDelta.push(otherOp).retain(0)
```
This would result in different behavior because `retain(0)` would retain the deleted content with a length of 0, which would effectively delete the content.

DONE.
