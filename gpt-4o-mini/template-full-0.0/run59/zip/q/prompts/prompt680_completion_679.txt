Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[null, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first element of the array from `void 0` (which is `undefined`) to `null`, potentially affecting how the receiving function interprets the first argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[1, array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it replaces `void 0` with the constant `1`, which alters the expected first argument passed to the `dispatch` method, likely leading to incorrect processing of the function call.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
[array_slice(arguments, 0), array_slice(arguments, 1)]
```
This would result in different behavior because it changes the first argument to be an array containing all arguments instead of just the first argument as `void 0`, which could lead to unexpected results in the function being called.

DONE.
