  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `fail` is a different method than `done`, and it would not be called with the same arguments as `done`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `then` is a different method than `done`, and it would not be called with the same arguments as `done`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).timeout
```
This would result in different behavior because `timeout` is a different method than `done`, and it would not be called with the same arguments as `done`.

DONE.
