  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this
```
This would result in different behavior because `this` would refer to the global object in strict mode, whereas `void 0` is a way to create a variable with undefined value in a concise way. If this replacement is made, the `this` value in the code would be different from the original code and could break the functionality.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive value, whereas `void 0` is not a value at all. If this replacement is made, the code would behave differently in certain cases, such as when the `then` method is called on a promise.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
NaN
```
This would result in different behavior because `NaN` is a special value that represents a computation error, whereas `void 0` is a way to create a variable with undefined value in a concise way. If this replacement is made, the code would behave differently
