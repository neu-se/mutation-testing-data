  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
args, op
```
This would result in different behavior because `args` is a list, and `op` is a string, whereas the original code expects `op` to be a string and `args` to be an array.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
op + args[0]
```
This would result in different behavior because `op + args[0]` would return a new string, whereas the original code expects an array of arguments to be passed.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` would not match any case in the switch statement, whereas the original code has a default case to handle the "promise" case.

DONE.
