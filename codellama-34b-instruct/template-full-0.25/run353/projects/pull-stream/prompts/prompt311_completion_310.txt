  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!data
```
This would result in different behavior because the `!` operator would negate the value of `data`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `data` is truthy, and `false` when `data` is falsy.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would add 1 to the value of `data`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `data` is greater than or equal to 1, and `false` when `data` is less than 1.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
data * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would double the value of `data`, causing the `if` statement to evaluate to `true` when `data` is greater than or equal to 2, and `false` when `data` is
