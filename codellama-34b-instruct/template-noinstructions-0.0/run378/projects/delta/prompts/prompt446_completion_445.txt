  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the `peekLength()` method to always return a value that is one greater than the actual length of the operation, which could cause the `hasNext()` method to return `true` even when there are no more operations to iterate over.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the `peekLength()` method to always return a value that is one less than the actual length of the operation, which could cause the `hasNext()` method to return `false` even when there are more operations to iterate over.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `peekLength()` method to always return a value that is twice the actual length of the operation, which
