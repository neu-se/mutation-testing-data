  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]y|quy/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches a `y` at the end of a word, regardless of whether it is preceded by a consonant or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/[^aeiou]quy$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now only matches words that end with `quy`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
/quy|y$/i
```
This would result in different behavior because the regular expression now matches words that end with `quy` or `y`.

DONE.
