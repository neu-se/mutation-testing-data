  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index <= count
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > count
```
This change will cause the loop to never execute, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= count
```
This change will cause the loop to iterate one extra time, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds error.

DONE.
