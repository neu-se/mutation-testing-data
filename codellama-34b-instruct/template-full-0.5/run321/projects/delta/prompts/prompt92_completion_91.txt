  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index > this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>` operator would always evaluate to `false`, even if `index` is greater than `this.ops.length`, since the `push` method only executes if the `index` is less than or equal to `this.ops.length`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index < this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `<` operator would always evaluate to `true`, even if `index` is less than `this.ops.length`, since the `push` method only executes if the `index` is less than or equal to `this.ops.length`.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
index >= this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `>=` operator would always evaluate to `true`, even if `index` is greater than `this.ops.length`, since the `push` method only executes if
