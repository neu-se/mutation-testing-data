  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to contain duplicate entries for each policy, with the same name and the same policy object. This could cause issues with the `query` and `matches` methods, which rely on the unique names of the policies to function correctly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.toLowerCase()]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `PolicyMap` to contain entries with the same name, but with different casing. This could cause issues with the `query` and `matches` methods, which rely on the exact name of the policies to function correctly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
(policy) => [policy.name, policy.name.split('').reverse().join('')]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the
