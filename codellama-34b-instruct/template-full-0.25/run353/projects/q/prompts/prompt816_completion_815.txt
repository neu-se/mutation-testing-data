  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).then
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` is a method that terminates a promise chain, while `Q.then` is a method that returns a promise for the resolution of the given promise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).fail
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` is a method that terminates a promise chain, while `Q.fail` is a method that provides an opportunity to observe the settling of a promise, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Q(object).finally
```
This would result in different behavior because `Q.done` is a method that terminates a promise chain, while `Q.finally` is a method that provides an opportunity to observe the settling of a promise, regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected, and forwards the resolution to the returned promise when the callback
