  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also includes the `promise` variable, which is not included in the replacement code fragment.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment also includes the `error` variable, which is not included in the replacement code fragment.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
error && promise
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment does not include the `&&` operator, which is included in the replacement code fragment.

DONE.
