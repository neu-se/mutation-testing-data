  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function_bind.call.uncurryThis
```
This would result in different behavior because `function_bind.call` will return a function that calls `uncurryThis` with the bound context, but `uncurryThis` is not a function and will throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
uncurryThis.bind(Function.call)
```
This would result in different behavior because `uncurryThis.bind(Function.call)` will return a function that calls `Function.call` with the bound context, but `Function.call` is not a function and will throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Function.call.uncurryThis
```
This would result in different behavior because `Function.call.uncurryThis` will return a function that calls `uncurryThis` with the bound context, but `uncurryThis` is not a function and will throw an error.
