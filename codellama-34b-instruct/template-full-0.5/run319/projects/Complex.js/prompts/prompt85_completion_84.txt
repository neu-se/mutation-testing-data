  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['NAN'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `NaN`, regardless of the input parameters.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['INFINITY'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `Infinity`, regardless of the input parameters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
return Complex['PI'];
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always return the value `Ï€`, regardless of the input parameters.

DONE.
