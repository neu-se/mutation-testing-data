  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-b
```
This would result in different behavior because the unary minus operator is applied to the variable `b`, which would result in a different value.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is incremented by 1, which would affect the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
b * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the value of `b` is multiplied by 2, which would affect the result of the `Math.sin()` function.

DONE.
