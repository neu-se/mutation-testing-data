  Here are three possible options:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because `undefined` is a primitive type and would throw a `TypeError` if `object_make` were called with this argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because `null` is a primitive type and would throw a `TypeError` if `object_make` were called with this argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{foo: "bar"}
```
This would result in different behavior because the object `{foo: "bar"}` would be created when `object_make` is called, but the expected behavior is for the function to return the object that is passed as an argument.

DONE.
