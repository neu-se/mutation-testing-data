 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() === 'insert'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would reverse the condition, causing the loop to continue when the current operation is an insert and the other iterator has an insert, and exit the loop otherwise.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
true
```
This would result in different behavior because it would always evaluate to true, causing the loop to exit immediately after checking the first operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```typescript
iter.peekType() === 'delete'
```
This would result in different behavior because it would only continue the loop when the current operation is a delete, which is not the same as checking if it's not an insert.

DONE.
