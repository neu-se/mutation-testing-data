  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length - 3
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be subtracted by 3 instead of 2, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length + 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be added to 2 instead of subtracted, which would cause the function to return a different result.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
w.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the length of the word would be multiplied by 2 instead of subtracted, which would cause the function to return a different result.

DONE.
