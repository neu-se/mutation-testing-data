Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index + 1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it attempts to access the next operation in the array instead of the current one, which could lead to incorrect length calculations and potentially accessing an undefined operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops[this.index] || null
```
This would result in different behavior because it will return `null` if the current operation is undefined, which could change the flow of logic in the `peekLength` method and affect how the rest of the methods handle the absence of an operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.ops.length
```
This would result in different behavior because it returns the total number of operations instead of the current operation, which would cause the length calculation to always return a positive number, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about the iterator's state.

DONE.
