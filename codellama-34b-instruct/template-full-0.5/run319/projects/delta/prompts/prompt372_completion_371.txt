  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the operation to be one more than the original length, which could cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the operation to be one less than the original length, which could cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Op.length * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the length of the operation to be twice the original length, which could cause the `transformPosition` method to return an incorrect index.

DONE.
