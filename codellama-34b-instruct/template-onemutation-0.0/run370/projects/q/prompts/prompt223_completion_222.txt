  The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
object_create(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because `object_create(null)` creates a new object with a null prototype, whereas `object_create` creates a new object with the default prototype. This could cause issues with the code that uses the created object, especially if it relies on the default prototype.
