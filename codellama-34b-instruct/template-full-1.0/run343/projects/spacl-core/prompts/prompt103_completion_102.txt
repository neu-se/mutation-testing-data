  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
path && verb && ctx
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the conditional operator (`?:`) to separate the `path`, `verb`, and `ctx` parameters, while this replacement code fragment combines them using the logical AND operator (`&&`). In the case where `path` or `verb` is falsy, the original code fragment would return the value of `ctx` directly, while this replacement code fragment would return `false`.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ctx ? ctx.request.url : path + verb
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the conditional operator (`?:`) to choose between `path` and `verb`, while this replacement code fragment uses the conditional operator to choose between `ctx.request.url` and `path + verb`. In the case where `ctx` is truthy, the original code fragment would return the value of `ctx.request.url`, while this replacement code fragment would return the concatenation of `path` and `verb`.
