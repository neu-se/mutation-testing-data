  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + " (no stack) "
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the string "(no stack) " with the reason, while this code fragment concatenates the reason with the string "(no stack) ".

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + " (no stack)"
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the string "(no stack) " with the reason, while this code fragment concatenates the reason with the string "(no stack)".

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
"(no stack) " + reason.toString()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment concatenates the string "(no stack) " with the reason, while this code fragment concatenates the string "(no stack) " with the result of calling the toString() method on the reason.

DONE.
