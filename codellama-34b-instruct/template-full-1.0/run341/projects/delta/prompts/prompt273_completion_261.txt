  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the retain operation to retain the entire length of the other operation, rather than just the length of the retain operation.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData - thisData;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the retain operation to retain a different length than the original retain operation.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
otherData + thisData;
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the retain operation to retain a different length than the original retain operation.

DONE.
