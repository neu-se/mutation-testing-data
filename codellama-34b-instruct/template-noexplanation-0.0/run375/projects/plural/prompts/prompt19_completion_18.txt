  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 's' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra 's' to the end of the word, which is not correct for all words that end in 'x' or 'ch'.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'xes' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra 'xes' to the end of the word, which is not correct for all words that end in 'x' or 'ch'.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
function(w) { return w + 'es' + 's' }
```
This code fragment is similar to the original, but it adds an extra 'es' and 's' to the end of the word, which is not correct for all words that end in 'x' or 'ch'.

DONE.
