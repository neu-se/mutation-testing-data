  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason.message
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason.message` is a string, while `reason` is an object.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reason + "error"
```
This would result in different behavior because `reason + "error"` is a string, while `reason` is an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
{ error: reason }
```
This would result in different behavior because `{ error: reason }` is an object, while `reason` is an object.

DONE.
