  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.get(key));
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with the list of callbacks for the given key, instead of just calling `_flush` with no arguments.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.get(key), true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with the list of callbacks for the given key and a `true` argument, which would cause the method to flush the queue immediately, instead of waiting for the next tick.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this._flush(this._queue.get(key), false, true);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would call the `_flush` method with the list of callbacks for the given key, a `false` argument to indicate that the queue should not be flushed immediately, and a `true` argument to indicate that
