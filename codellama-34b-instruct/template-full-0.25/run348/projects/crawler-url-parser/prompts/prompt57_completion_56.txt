  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would remove the protocol from the URL, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'http://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with a hardcoded value, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
currentUrlStr.replace(/^https?:\/\//, 'https://')
```
This would result in different behavior because it would replace the protocol with a hardcoded value, which could cause the URL to be parsed incorrectly.

DONE.
