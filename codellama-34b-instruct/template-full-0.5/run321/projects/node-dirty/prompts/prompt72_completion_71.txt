  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a size of 1 instead of 0, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', '0'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a string value of `'0'` instead of a number value of `0`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'load', 'drain'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `load` event would be emitted with a string value of `'drain'` instead of a number value of `0`, which could cause the code to behave differently in certain situations.

DONE.
