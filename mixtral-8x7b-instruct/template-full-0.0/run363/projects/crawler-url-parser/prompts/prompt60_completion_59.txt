 Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, false, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `slashesDash` option is set to `true`, which will treat slashes in the query string as if they were dashes.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, true, false
```
This would result in different behavior because the `parseQueryString` option is set to `false`, which will prevent the parsing of the query string into an object.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```javascript
currentUrlStr, 'loose'
