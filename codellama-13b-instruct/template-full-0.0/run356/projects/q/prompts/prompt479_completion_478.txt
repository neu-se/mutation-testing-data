  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+` operator has higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the code would be interpreted as `at + (1, 1)` instead of `at, 1`. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `-` operator has higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the code would be interpreted as `at - (1, 1)` instead of `at, 1`. This would cause the `untrackRejection` function to be called with the wrong argument, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
at * 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `*` operator has higher precedence than the `,` operator, so the code
