  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
typeof options !== 'string'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is a string, but the new code fragment checks if it is not a string. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the if statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options instanceof String
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is a string using the `typeof` operator, but the new code fragment checks if it is an instance of the `String` class using the `instanceof` operator. This change would cause the code to take a different branch in the if statement, potentially leading to different behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
options.constructor === String
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `options` is a string using the `typeof` operator, but the new code fragment checks if the constructor of `options` is
